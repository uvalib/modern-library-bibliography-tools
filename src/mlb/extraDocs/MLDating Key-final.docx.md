##DATING KEY TO MODERN LIBRARY LISTS AND JACKETS   

This dating key can be used to date Modern Library books and jackets on the basis of Modern Library lists that appear at the end of many of the volumes and inside the jackets. The dating key indicates one title added in each season and one title (preceded by an *x*) that would not be added until the following season. This makes it possible to date any ML jacket and any ML book that contains a list as having been printed by spring or fall of a given year.   

From fall 1933 through spring 1963 the inside of the jackets included a heading, “WHICH OF THESE \[#] OUTSTANDING BOOKS DO YOU WANT TO READ?” This number is indicated before the titles for these years. Lists of titles ceased to be printed inside the jackets beginning in 1964.
