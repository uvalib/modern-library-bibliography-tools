/**
 * A tap/mousedown on a list item makes that item current.
 *
 * This simple mixin is useful in list-like elements like [ListBox](ListBox),
 * where a tap/mousedown on a list item implicitly selects it.
 *
 * The standard use for this mixin is in list-like elements. Native list
 * boxes don't appear to be consistent with regard to whether they select
 * on mousedown or click/mouseup. This mixin assumes the use of mousedown.
 * On touch devices, that event appears to trigger when the touch is *released*.
 *
 * This mixin only listens to mousedown events for the primary mouse button
 * (typically the left button). Right clicks are ignored so that the browser may
 * display a context menu.
 *
 * This mixin expects the component to provide an `state.items` member. It also
 * expects the component to define a `state.currentIndex` member; you can
 * provide that yourself, or use [ItemsCursorMixin](ItemsCursorMixin).
 *
 * If the component receives an event that doesn't correspond to an item (e.g.,
 * the user taps on the element background visible between items), the cursor
 * will be removed. However, if the component sets `state.currentItemRequired` to
 * true, a background tap will *not* remove the cursor.
 *
 * @module TapCursorMixin
 * @param {Constructor<ReactiveElement>} Base
