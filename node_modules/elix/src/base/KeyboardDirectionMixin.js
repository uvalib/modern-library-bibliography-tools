/**
 * Maps direction keys to direction semantics.
 *
 * This mixin is useful for components that want to map direction keys (Left,
 * Right, etc.) to movement in the indicated direction (go left, go right,
 * etc.).
 *
 * This mixin expects the component to invoke a `keydown` method when a key is
 * pressed. You can use [KeyboardMixin](KeyboardMixin) for that
 * purpose, or wire up your own keyboard handling and call `keydown` yourself.
 *
 * This mixin calls methods such as `goLeft` and `goRight`. You can define
 * what that means by implementing those methods yourself. If you want to use
 * direction keys to navigate a selection, use this mixin with
 * [DirectionCursorMixin](DirectionCursorMixin).
 *
 * If the component defines a property called `orientation`, the value of that
 * property will constrain navigation to the horizontal or vertical axis.
 *
 * @module KeyboardDirectionMixin
 * @param {Constructor<ReactiveElement>} Base
