Cerf negotiated an agreement to buy the Modern Library from Horace Liveright. He had dreamed of having his own firm from the time he entered publishing, and Liveright, as usual, needed money. The firm had not had a best seller since 1923, Liveright was losing money in the stock market, he was beginning to moonlight as a Broadway producer, and he wanted a divorce. As part of the separation agreement he had to repay large sums that he had borrowed from his wife and father-in-law. Liveright’s latest biographer indicates that the debts to his wife and father-in-law had been repaid at this point and speculates that his primary reason for selling the Modern Library was “the huge amounts he required to continue producing plays on Broadway” (Dardis, p. 228).</span>

Komroff Papers, Columbia University Library). Cerf recalls the decision as having been proposed and settled on May 19. Liveright, who took Cerf to a farewell luncheon to celebrate Cerf’s departure that evening on his first trip to Europe, complained about financial pressures. Cerf repeated an offer he had made before to buy the Modern Library. This time, instead of brushing him off, Liveright asked what he would pay for it, and they continued to negotiate at the office that afternoon. By the end of the afternoon a deal had been struck (Cerf, </span>

Included in that sum was the $25,000 that Cerf had lent Liveright when he joined the firm and an additional $25,000 he lent him subsequently. Cerf was getting the Modern Library for an additional payment of $150,000. The money was due after Cerf’s return from Europe, with Cerf to assume control of the series on August 1st.</span>

Klopfer to put up $100,000 and go in with him as equal partner, but Klopfer was not certain at the time Cerf sailed that he would be able to raise the money. The two men had met during the autumn of 1918 at Columbia University, when Cerf was a senior and Klopfer was a freshman. Klopfer transferred to Williams College in the middle of his freshman year, but he and Cerf remained friends. Cerf recalled in his autobiography that after attending a concert at Carnegie Hall they walked “all the way around Central Park – over to Fifth Avenue up to 110th Street, over to Central Park West and down to 59th Street, just talking. And when we finished that walk, we were friends for life” (Cerf, </span>

His stepfather had since died, leaving Klopfer his interest in the closely held firm. The other owners agreed to buy Klopfer’s interest for 80 percent of the book value, giving him the $100,000 he needed (Klopfer, interview with GBN, 5 July 1978), and he had the money by the time Cerf returned from Europe.</span>

At this point Cerf’s uncle, Herbert Wise, came to their aid, lending them 500 shares of Norfolk and Western railroad stock, which was then selling for about $130 a share. They used the stock as collateral for a $50,000 bank loan. They returned the stock to Wise a hundred shares at a time and were able to pay off the entire loan within two years.</span>

At the last minute Liveright insisted that Cerf and Klopfer give him a contract as an adviser for five years at five thousand dollars a year. “His advice was the last thing we needed,” Cerf recalled, “but he said if we didn’t agree to it, the deal was off. So we had to give in” (Cerf, </span>

They acquired the name and good will of the series, reprint rights to copyrighted titles included in it, the plates owned by Boni and Liveright, and the stock of books on hand, most of which were unbound. The value of the plates and books was estimated at $75,000 (Columbia Auditors, C.P.A., to Henry Hoyns, Harper and Bros., 22 July 1925; Random House Papers, Columbia University Library).</span>

Gustave Cerf (Cerf’s father), who worked on a part-time basis until his death in 1941, was listed as Secretary and Treasurer. They were joined by two Boni and Liveright employees: Emanuel Harper, who soon became the firm’s treasurer, and Helen Berlin, who was Cerf and Klopfer’s secretary from 1925 until 1928. The Modern Library, Inc. opened for business in a two-room office on the ninth floor of 71 West 45th Street. Cerf and Klopfer worked at desks facing each other. After moving to larger quarters they continued to share an office and work at facing desks until Klopfer accepted a commission in the Air Force in May 1942. They shared a secretary until Cerf’s death in 1971.</span>

Cerf offered Appleton a five-year reprint contract with royalties of 8 cents a copy for Millay’s plays “Two Slatterns and a King,” “Aria da Capo,” and “The Lamp and the Bell”, indicating that he wanted to use Appleton plates for a first ML printing of 3,000 copies. Millay’s publisher flatly rejected the offer (John W. Hiltman, Appleton &amp; Co., to Cerf, 14 October 1925).</span>

De la Mare replied that the decision must be left to his American publishers but indicated that he had asked his agent, James B. Pinker, to take up the matter with them (de la Mare to Cerf, 19 November 1925). Several weeks later Pinker told Cerf that none of de la Mare’s American publishers were willing to authorize a reprint edition (James B. Pinker &amp; Sons to Cerf, 14 December 1925).</span>

The novel and the play have been blown about the world at a fearful rate, but the story has never lost its happy juvenility, a charm that nothing can vulgarize. It is all champagne and tears – fresh perversity, fresh credulity, fresh passion, fresh pain. We have seen the play both well done and ill done – in strange places, in barbarous tongues. But nothing makes any difference – it carries with it an April air: some tender young man and some coughing young woman have only to speak the lines to give it a great place among the love-stories of the world.”  HENRY JAMES (</span>

These do not present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died before the book was half done.</span>

His writings have had an influence that has reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (</span>

In November 1926 Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana.
