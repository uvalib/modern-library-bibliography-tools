          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1925 1925 The Modern Library series was founded in May 1917 by Boni & Liveright, a new publishing firm that was created to publish the Modern Library. The series was conceived by Albert Boni, a twenty-five year old Greenwich Village bookseller and occasional publisher. The Modern Library was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an intense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural upheaval. His Washington Square Bookshop was a favorite gathering place for Village artists and intellectuals. He was one of the founders of the Washington Square Players. As publisher of The Glebe, a little magazine edited by Alfred Kreymborg, he was already active in promoting translations of modern European writers—much to the dismay of Kreymborg, who was interested mainly in discovering and nurturing unknown Americans.   \n\nIn May 1925, less than two years after joining Boni & Liveright as vice-president president, Bennett A. Cerf negotiated an agreement to buy the Modern Library from Horace Liveright. He had dreamed of having his own firm from the time he entered publishing, and Liveright, as usual, needed money. The firm had not had a best seller since 1923, Liveright was losing money in the stock market, he was beginning to moonlight as a Broadway producer, and he wanted a divorce. As part of the separation agreement he had to repay large sums that he had borrowed from his wife and father-in-law. Tom Dardis, Liveright’s latest biographer, indicates that the debts to his wife and father-in-law had been repaid at this point and speculates that his primary reason for selling the Modern Library was “the huge amounts he required to continue producing plays on Broadway” (Dardis, Firebrand: The Life of Horace Liveright, p. 228).   \n\nIn his unpublished autobiography, written shortly before his death, Liveright indicates that the meeting at which the sale of the Modern Library was agreed to was preceded by several weeks of conversations and meetings with friends and advisers and with Cerf and his advisers (Autobiography, insert y, p. 2. Komroff Papers, Columbia University Library). Cerf recalls the decision as having been proposed and settled on May 19. Liveright, who took Cerf to a farewell luncheon to celebrate Cerf’s departure that evening for his first trip to Europe, complained about financial pressures. Cerf repeated an offer he had made before to buy the Modern Library. This time, instead of brushing him off, Liveright asked what he would pay for it, and they continued to negotiate at the office that afternoon. By the end of the afternoon a deal had been struck (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 44–46).   \n\nCerf and Liveright agreed to a selling price of \\$200,000. Included in that sum was the \\$25,000 that Cerf had lent Liveright when he joined the firm and an additional \\$25,000 he lent him subsequently. Cerf was getting the Modern Library for an additional payment of \\$150,000. The money was due after Cerf’s return from Europe, with Cerf to assume control of the series on August 1st.   \n\nThat evening Cerf sailed on the *Aquitania* for his first trip to Europe. That night he wrote in his diary:     \n\n>And so I’m off for bed after the most eventful day of my life. I bought the Modern Library from Boni & Liveright after a whirlwind conference—a step that will alter my entire career (Cerf, Diary, 20 May 1925, Bennet Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library).   \n\nHe celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday on his last full day at sea before arriving at Southampton on May 26th.   \n\nMany details of the purchase remained to be settled. Cerf’s plans called for Donald S. Klopfer to put up \\$100,000 and go in with him as equal partner, but Klopfer was not certain at the time Cerf sailed that he would be able to raise the money. The two men had met during the autumn of 1918 at Columbia University, when Cerf was a senior and Klopfer was a freshman. Klopfer transferred to Williams College in the middle of his freshman year, but he and Cerf remained friends. Cerf recalled in his autobiography that after attending a concert at Carnegie Hall they walked “all the way around Central Park – over to Fifth Avenue up to 110th Street, over to Central Park West and down to 59th Street, just talking. And when we finished that walk, we were friends for life” (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 24–25).   \n\nKlopfer left college after his sophomore year to work for his stepfather, who held a one-sixth interest in United Diamond Works, a diamond cutting and polishing factory in Newark, New Jersey. His stepfather had since died, leaving Klopfer his interest in the closely held firm. The other owners agreed to buy Klopfer’s interest for 80 percent of the book value, giving him the \\$100,000 he needed (Klopfer, interview with GBN, 5 July 1978), and he had the money by the time Cerf returned from Europe.   \n\nThat gave Cerf and Klopfer enough money to buy the Modern Library, but they lacked working capital to meet operating expenses. At this point Cerf’s uncle, Herbert Wise, came to their aid, lending them 500 shares of Norfolk and Western railroad stock, which was then selling for about \\$130 a share. They used the stock as collateral for a \\$50,000 bank loan. They returned the stock to Wise a hundred shares at a time and were able to pay off the entire loan within two years.   \n\nOne final hitch came up before the sale of the Modern Library was completed. At the last minute Liveright insisted that Cerf and Klopfer give him a contract as an adviser for five years at five thousand dollars a year. “His advice was the last thing we needed,” Cerf recalled, “but he said if we didn’t agree to it, the deal was off. So we had to give in” (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 54). Shortly after they took over the series they offered Liveright a lump payment of fifteen thousand dollars to cancel the agreement, and Liveright accepted. So the total cost of the Modern Library came to \\$215,000.   \n\nOwnership of the Modern Library was transferred to Cerf and Klopfer on 1 August 1925. They acquired the name and good will of the series, reprint rights to copyrighted titles included in it, the plates owned by Boni & Liveright, and the stock of books on hand, most of which were unbound. The value of the plates and books was estimated at \\$75,000 (Columbia Auditors, C.P.A. to Henry Hoyns, Harper and Bros., 22 July 1925).   \n\nThe new company was incorporated as The Modern Library, Inc., with Cerf as President and Klopfer as Vice-President. Gustave Cerf (Cerf’s father), who worked on a part-time basis until his death in 1941, was listed as Secretary and Treasurer. They were joined by two Boni & Liveright employees: Emanuel Harper, who soon became the firm’s treasurer, and Helen Berlin, who was Cerf and Klopfer’s secretary from 1925 until 1928. The Modern Library, Inc. opened for business in a two-room office on the ninth floor of 71 West 45th Street. Cerf and Klopfer worked at desks facing each other. After moving to larger quarters they continued to share an office and work at facing desks until Klopfer accepted a commission in the Air Force in May 1942. They shared a secretary until Cerf’s death in 1971.   \n\nThe sale of the Modern Library was announced in the *New York Times* on 13 July 1925. The following advertisement appeared in *Publishers’ Weekly* (1 August 1925, p. 423; italics in original):     \n\nNews! > THE MODERN LIBRARY HAS CHANGED HANDS! > ON AUGUST FIRST, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, a new organization will assume publication and distribution of the MODERN LIBRARY. > Its name will be the MODERN LIBRARY, Incorporated. > Its address will be 71 West 45th Street, New York City. > Its sole endeavor will be the further development and exploitation of a series that has grown in eight years to embrace 110 titles, and to be known wherever English books are read. > The format and general character of THE MODERN LIBRARY books will be absolutely unchanged. > The American bookseller can count on the generous cooperation of an experienced and strongly fortified organization with *no general publications over which to concern itself*, devoting its entire energies to one project – the growth of the MODERN LIBRARY. All new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).   \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.   \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). A large portion of the ML stock that Cerf and Klopfer acquired from B&L consisted of folded and sewn sheets with Brodzky endpapers attached to the outer leaves. These were sold in ML, Inc. imitation leather bindings and newly printed ML, Inc. jackets. This hybrid format, with B&L title pages and endpapers and ML, Inc. bindings and jackets, is common for final B&L printings. Bound and jacketed volumes acquired from B&L were sold as they were; a small number of bound B&L titles were provided with newly printed ML, Inc. jackets. New titles added to the ML in fall 1925 used the title page design inherited from B&L with torchbearer A1 (designed by Lucian Bernhard) replacing the B&L monk device. The title page is enclosed in double rules with each section (title, author, author of the introduction, device, publisher, and place of publication) separated by a horizontal rule. Most B&L titles that were reprinted between fall 1925 and 1939 continued to use existing title-page plates with the B&L device replaced by torchbearer A1. In general, new title-page plates were made for B&L titles only when the text was reset or augmented with new content. Imitation leather in dark green or brown with spine lettering in gold and Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front panel. The bindings were identical to those used by B&L except for the use of the torchbearer device in place of the B&L device The Brodzky endpaper inherited from B&L was used on the first printing of Beebe’s *Jungle Peace* (116) and the earliest ML, Inc. reprints of some B&L titles. Bernhard’s new endpaper incorporating his torchbearer design, printed in light yellowish brown, was used on all subsequent titles and later printings of *Jungle Peace*. Uniform typographic jacket is patterned after late B&L jackets. The Bernhard torchbearer replaces the B&L device on the spine but does not appear on the front panel. Fall 1925 jackets indicate the title and author in capital letters on a deep reddish orange band near the top of the front panel and the series (“The Modern Library” in upper- and lowercase letters) on a deep reddish orange band near the bottom. The jackets include a complete list of ML titles on the flaps and back panel. Both jacket flaps include the publisher’s name and address: the Modern Library, Inc., 71 West 45th St., New York. Some fall 1925 jackets have the statement “New title added monthly” at the bottom of the front flap instead of the publisher’s name and address. 95 cents. (Fall) Dumas, *Camille* xAnderson, *Poor White*. Theodore Dreiser was one of the first authors Cerf contacted after buying the ML. Cerf expressed the hope that *Free and Other Stories* (106) would remain in the series for many years to come and that Dreiser would allow the ML to include one of his novels “on a basis that I am sure could be made satisfactory to both of us” (Cerf to Dreiser, 25 July 1925). *Twelve Men* (159) was added in 1928 and *Sister Carrie* (230) followed in 1932. *An American Tragedy* (G89), which B&L published in fall 1925 shortly after Cerf and Klopfer took over the ML, was reprinted as a ML Giant in 1956.   \n\nWilla Cather and Edna St. Vincent Millay were among the first authors that Cerf tried to secure for the ML. He wanted Cather’s *Song of the Lark* and a volume of plays by Millay, but the original publishers declined to grant reprint rights. *The Song of the Lark* sold too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a ML edition (Robert N. Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 4 September 1925). Cerf offered Appleton a five-year reprint contract with royalties of 8 cents a copy for Millay’s plays “Two Slatterns and a King,” “Aria da Capo,” and “The Lamp and the Bell,” indicating that he wanted to use Appleton plates for a first ML printing of 3,000 copies. Millay’s publisher flatly rejected the offer (John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., to Cerf, 14 October 1925).   \n\nAfter meeting Walter de la Mare during his trip to England in the summer of 1925, Cerf wrote to enlist his support for a ML edition of one of his works: “I am particularly anxious to have a Walter de La [*sic*] Mare title in the library and am writing direct to you because before I proceed to interview any of the American publishers who hold the copyright to your works, I would like to hear from you which one of your books, in your opinion, would fit best in the series” (Cerf to de la Mare, 16 October 1925). De la Mare replied that the decision must be left to his American publishers but indicated that he had asked his agent, James B. Pinker, to take up the matter with them (de la Mare to Cerf, 19 November 1925). Several weeks later Pinker told Cerf that none of de la Mare’s American publishers were willing to authorize a reprint edition (James B. Pinker & Sons to Cerf, 14 December 1925).   \n\nCerf contacted H. L. Mencken in 1926 about adding his *Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche* to the series, but Mencken replied that it was outmoded and in need of revision (Cerf to Mencken, 14 December 1925; Mencken to Cerf, 22 December 1925). Originally published in 1908, Mencken’s study was the first book on Nietzsche in English (Hobson, Fred. *Mencken: A Life*, p. 89). It has been widely reprinted since it entered the public domain, including several reprint editions in the first decade of the twenty-first century.   \n\nThe New York publisher Charles Renard offered to sell the ML its plates for J. M. Barrie’s *The Little Minister*. Cerf replied that the ML would “have no possible use for the plates . . . for some time to come” but offered \\$50 for them (Charles Renard Co. to Cerf, 18 November 1925; Cerf to Renard Co., 30 November 1925). He later increased the offer to \\$200, but this appears to have been much less than Renard wanted. Blasco Ibáñez, *The Cabin* (1920) 73 nStephens, *Mary, Mary* (1917) 26   \n\nOnly a few hundred copies of *Mary, Mary* (26) and *The Cabin* (73) remained in the B&L warehouse when Cerf and Klopfer took over the series. They promptly discontinued them and reassigned their catalogue numbers, ML 30 and 69, to Beebe, *Jungle Peace* and Dumas, *Camille*, the first new titles added in fall 1925. The Modern Library series was founded in May 1917 by Boni & Liveright, a new publishing firm that was created to publish the Modern Library. The series was conceived by Albert Boni, a twenty-five year old Greenwich Village bookseller and occasional publisher. The Modern Library was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an intense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural upheaval. His Washington Square Bookshop was a favorite gathering place for Village artists and intellectuals. He was one of the founders of the Washington Square Players.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1926 1926 Cerf and Klopfer did not discontinue any Modern Library titles in 1926 and added twelve new titles to the series, bringing the total number of active titles to 125. One of the additions was Beerbohm, *Zuleika Dobson*, which had been in the Boni & Liveright series between 1918 and 1922. *Zuleika Dobson* may have been withdrawn from the series by Dodd, Mead & Co., which made a new printing of its own in 1924. Two years later Cerf and Klopfer were able to restore it to the series. All families of printings of *Zuleika Dobson* in the ML, including those between 1926 and 1970 (36c‑d), are described in the chapter for 1918. All new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).  \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm).  \n\nMost ML books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).  \n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format, with the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 108 mm) and the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4¼ in. (167 x 110 mm). The ML’s standard format increased in 1939 to a trim size of 7 x 4⅝ in. (177 x 118 mm) with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4¾ in. (183 x 122 mm) and in 1969 to a taller, slightly slimmer trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (183 x 115 mm) with the binding measuring 7½ x 4⅝ in. (190 x 118 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound as gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).  \n\nML books were printed by the Ferris Printing Co. in New York City during the early months of 1926. Later in the year the ML switched to Parkway Printing Co., 400 Lafayette St., New York City. Parkway continued to print all ML books for decades to come except for a small number of titles before the 1960s that were printed by offset lithography. Elmer Adler, proprietor of the Pynson Press in New York, redesigned the ML title page. He retained the basic design inherited from B&L but made the title page more elegant and appealing. He replaced the B&L double-rule frame with a frame consisting of a thick outer rule and thin inner rule, used open-face type for the title, and eliminated the rule between THE MODERN LIBRARY and the last line of the title page. He also changed PUBLISHERS :: :: NEW YORK to the less cluttered PUBLISHERS · NEW YORK and then, beginning with the third title published in 1926, to the more distinctive PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK. He also enlarged Bernhard’s torchbearer from 18 to 26 mm (torchbearer A2). The first version of Adler’s title page was used in January with Brontë’s *Wuthering Heights*; the latter version was introduced with Wilde’s *De Profundis* in April. Adler’s basic title page design remained in use through 1939 with changes in the imprint area in 1931 and 1936.  \n\nIn general, titles from the B&L era were provided with Adler title pages only when the text was reset or augmented with new content. Examples include Flaubert, *Madame Bovary* (25.2a) in 1927 and Gautier, *Mademoiselle de Maupin & One of Cleopatra’s Nights* (51g) in 1935. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine lettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover. Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown. The first two 1926 titles, Brontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120) and Anderson, *Poor White* (121), were published in uniform typographic jacket B1 with no torchbearer on the front panel, “The Modern Library” in upper- and lowercase letters on a deep reddish orange band near the bottom of the front panel, and a list of ML titles on the flaps and back panel. All other titles added to the series in 1926 were published in uniform typographic jacket B2, with Bernhard’s torchbearer added to the front panel above the descriptive text and “THE MODERN LIBRARY” printed in uppercase letters on the deep reddish orange band near the bottom of the front panel.  \n\nUniform typographic jacket B2 and later jackets have the following text on the front and back flaps:  \n\n> 95¢ net ($1 in Canada) \n*On the inside of this jacket is a list, arranged alphabetically by authors, of all the titles in* <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern library</span>*.

Titles are selected with rigid care to represent the very best in modern literature and thought. Constant improvement is being effected in the manufacture of the books. They are printed from new, clear type, on a superior quality paper and bound in full limp fashion, the tops stained and the decorations in genuine gold. They will fit into any pocket and are ideal for a journey or the library table. Their introductions are brilliant and authoritative; a list of the men who have contributed introductions to <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern library</span> reads like a Literary “Who’s Who” of America. \n The notion is an obvious one to express but bears repeating: it is possible for a poor man to gather unto himself a library as extensive and as “correct” as any bibliophile if he will make use of <span class=\"smallcaps\"> the modern library</span> and kindred series of older classics. One book a week, at a cost scarcely noticeable, and in time one may harvest for his own consumption the wisdom and the dreams of the ages!  \n\nThis text was used without revision on jacket flaps through July 1933.

(Spring) Anderson, *Poor White* xJoyce, *Dubliners*. (Fall) Joyce, *Dubliners* xHudson, *Purple Land*. d Cerf and Klopfer tried to include several titles published by Alfred A. Knopf after they bought the Modern Library, but Knopf refused to allow any of his publications to be reprinted in the series. His standards of production and design were the highest of any major American trade publisher, and he “did not in those days care to see cheap editions published of our most distinguished books” (Knopf, letter to GBN, 4 May 1977). Knopf also had other reasons for his coolness toward the ML. He associated Cerf with Horace Liveright, whom he loathed; in particular he resented the ML edition of W. H. Hudson’s *Green Mansions* (90). It was Knopf’s edition of *Green Mansions*, published in 1916, that established the work in the United States, but Knopf did not own the copyright. *Green Mansions* was in the U.S. public domain because its original American publication by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in 1904 used imported sheets of the English edition. The U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 limited American copyright to works that were printed and bound in the U.S.; the use of imported sheets cast a work irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. When Liveright added *Green Mansions* to the ML he did not pay royalties to Knopf. Moreover, he reprinted it with John Galsworthy’s introduction, which had been written for the Knopf edition but does not appear to have been copyrighted. Relations between Knopf and the ML remained cool until January 1929, when a luncheon meeting organized with the help of Blanche Knopf led to friendly relations between the two firms.  \n\nBefore 1929 Cerf appealed directly to several Knopf authors in an attempt to secure their support for ML editions of their works. He wrote to Joseph Hergesheimer:  \n\nIt is all very well for us to advertise that our Modern Library contains books by all the great modern American writers . . . but I am extremely conscious of the fact that so long as no book of yours is on the list, there is a glaring gap that we cannot explain.” He asked whether “there is no way for us to have one of your books in the library. I find Mr. Knopf very elusive and vague on the subject of adding any volumes on which he owns the copyright to our series—a condition which I very much regret, because as you know, there are many other items besides your books on his list, which could be put in the Modern Library, to the advantage of everybody. . . . Is there not some way in which you can prevail upon Mr. Knopf to let us have one of your books?  \n\nCerf indicated that the ML would prefer *The Three Black Pennies* above all others (Cerf to Hergesheimer, 30 March 1926). Hergesheimer’s standing declined in the 1930s, and Cerf did not renew his offer after relations with Knopf improved.  \n\nAnother Knopf author that Cerf tried to get for the ML was Arthur Machen. He was especially interested in Machen’s *The House of Souls* (Knopf, 1922) or *The Hill of Dreams* (Knopf, 1923). During a 1926 visit to London Cerf took Machen to lunch at Claridge’s and suggested a ML edition of one of the books. Machen’s American agent indicated that both books were in the U.S. public domain but that the rights situation was complicated (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 8 June 1927). Cerf indicated that Machen “is anxious to see them in the Library; he is, as usual, as you know, in need of money. However, I believe that we could not do either of these books without getting into a serious jam with Knopf, and I would do nothing about them unless we had his definite consent” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 8 June 1927). Machen also did not want to oppose Knopf in any way. He wrote: “My reason is that it was he who brought me out in your country & did everything in his power to make me popular in America; also that he has paid me extremely handsome fees for writing introductions. . . . Therefore I should not feel happy in opposing him in any matter” (Machen to Cerf, 5 July 1926). None of Machen’s books were reprinted in the ML, but he wrote an introduction to the ML edition of Smollett’s *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (179). Cerf paid him \\$100 for the introduction, twice the ML’s usual fee.  \n\nOther works that Cerf considered adding to the series included Montesquieu’s *Persian Letters*, Frank Swinnerton’s *Nocturne*, and a volume of Edmond Rostand’s plays to include *Cyrano de Bergerac*, *Chanticleer*, and *L’Aiglon*. He asked John Erskine to write an introduction to *Persian Letters*, but the volume never appeared (Cerf to Erskine, 4 October 1926). Swinnerton’s literary agent declined the offer for *Nocturne* (Brandt & Brandt to Cerf, 16 October 1926), and the ML ended up publishing *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174) as a separate volume in 1929.  \n\nHorace M. Kallen suggested a volume of Bernard Shaw’s works. Shaw was opposed to inexpensive reprints of his plays and kept tight control of his copyrights. Cerf replied, “If you can suggest how in hell’s bells we can sign Shaw up for such a volume, you will immediately be elected Patron Saint of the Modern Library” (Cerf to Kallen, 13 October 1926). It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays. Shaw relaxed his opposition to inexpensive reprints on one occasion toward the end of his life. In 1946 he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.  \n\nHenry Hoyns of Harper & Bros. suggested W. E. Woodward’s *Bunk*, which Harper’s had published three years earlier (Hoyns to Cerf, 15 March 1926). The Boston publisher Lewis C. Page, who had failed on more than one occasion to persuade B&L to reprint Gustav Frenssen’s novel *Holyland*, repeated his suggestion to the ML’s new owners (Page to ML, 17 September 1926). Page also suggested Balzac’s *Physiology of Marriage* for the ML. Cerf responded, “The Lord knows it is dull enough reading, but the title might make it a good seller, and there is just a chance that we will be able to make some arrangement with you for its publication late next year” (Cerf to Page, 16 February 1926). Page replied, “You are entirely right in your analysis of the literary qualities and trade appeal. It is heavy reading for Modernists, but the title is alluring, and we have a steady sale” (Page to Cerf, 19 February 1926). For the 1926 Christmas season the ML packaged fifty titles in boxed sets of five volumes each. The ten boxed sets were sold primarily in department stores and were intended for “that vast army of Christmas book buyers who like to have their shopping made as simple as possible for them” (ML ad, *PW*, 4 September 1926, pp. 803–4). Each set was devoted to a particular theme and sold for \\$4.75, the same price as five volumes purchased separately. Unlike subsequent Christmas gift boxes, books in the 1926 sets appear to have been indistinguishable from ML volumes sold separately. None of the boxed sets from 1926 are known to have survived. The ten sets were:  \n\n1. *Masterpieces of French Romance*: Gautier, *Mademoiselle de Maupin*; Flaubert, *Madame Bovary*; Dumas, *Camille*; France, *The Red Lily*; and Maupassant, *Une Vie*.  \n\n2. *Great English Novels*: Butler, *The Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *The Return of the Native*; Meredith, *Diana of the Crossways*; Brontë, *Wuthering Heights*; and Hudson, *Green Mansions*.  \n\n3. *Modern Drama*: Ibsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the Peopl*e; Tolstoy, *Redemption and Two Other Plays*; Schnitzler, *Anatol, Living Hours, The Green Cockatoo*; O’Neill, *The Moon of the Caribbees and Six Other Plays of the Sea*; and Wilde, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*.  \n\n4. *Short Stories*: *Best Russian Short Stories*; Balzac, *Short Stories*; Kipling, *Soldiers Three*; Maupassant, *Love and Other Stories*; and *Best Ghost Stories*.  \n\n5. *Leading American Authors*: Anderson, *Poor White*; Melville, *Moby Dick*; Cabell, *Beyond Life*; Dreiser, *Free and Other Stories*; and James, *Daisy Miller; An International Episode*.  \n\n6. *Books of Modern Thought*: *The Philosophy of William James*; Nietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra*; Schopenhauer, *Studies in Pessimism*; Ellis, *The New Spirit*; and *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*.  \n\n7. *Great Modern Poetry*: Whitman, *Poems*; Swinburne, *Poems*; Dowson, *Poems and Prose*; Blake, *Poems*; and Wilde, *Poems*.  \n\n8. *Five Great Juveniles*: Carroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, The Hunting of the Snark*; Van Loon, *Ancient Man*; *Irish Fairy and Folk Tales*, ed. Yeats; Wilde, *Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose*; and Stevenson, *Treasure Island*.  \n\n9. *Belles Lettres*: Pater, *The Renaissance*; *The Art of Audrey Beardsley*; *A Modern Book of Criticism*; Moore, *Confessions of a Young Man*; and Pepys, *Passages from the* *Diary of Samuel Pepys*.  \n\n10. *Leading English Authors of Today*: Douglas, *South Wind*; Beerbohm, *Zuleika Dobson*; George, *A Bed of Roses*; Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*; and Shaw, *An Unsocial Socialist*.  \n\nTen gift boxes to choose from may have been too many, and \\$4.75 may have been more than many shoppers wished to spend on a gift. The boxed sets continued to be listed in the ML’s spring–summer 1927 catalog, but there were no gift boxes for the 1927 holiday season. The following year a single Christmas gift box of three ML volumes in distinctive jackets and bindings was offered at \\$2.85. Three gift boxes of three volumes each were offered during the 1929 Christmas season. Brontë, *Wuthering Heights* (1926) 120 <br /> Anderson, *Poor White* (1926) 121 <br /> Beerbohm, *Zuleika Dobson* (1926) 36c\\* <br /> Wilde, *De Profundis* (1926) 122 <br /> D’Annunzio, *Maidens of the Rocks* (1926) 123 <br /> Melville, *Moby Dick* (1926) 124 <br /> Gourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926) 125 <br /> Hardy, *Return of the Native* (1926) 126 <br /> Defoe, *Moll Flanders* (1926) 127 <br /> Lewisohn, *Up Stream* (1926) 128 <br /> Joyce, *Dubliners* (1926) 129 <br /> Gissing, *New Grub Street* (1926) 130 <br />  \n\n\\**Zuleika Dobson* (36) was published in the Boni & Liveright series in 1918 and discontinued around the end of 1922; Cerf and Klopfer restored it to the ML in March 1926. All families of printings in the ML are described under 1918. None.  \n\n#### ***Spring*** Cerf and Klopfer did not discontinue any Modern Library titles in 1926 and added twelve new titles to the series, bringing the total number of active titles to 125. One of the additions was Beerbohm, *Zuleika Dobson*, which had been in the Boni & Liveright series between 1918 and 1922. *Zuleika Dobson* may have been withdrawn from the series by Dodd, Mead & Co., which made a new printing of its own in 1924. Two years later Cerf and Klopfer were able to restore it to the series. All families of printings of *Zuleika Dobson* in the ML, including those between 1926 and 1970 (36c‑d), are described in the chapter for 1918. [object Object]",

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927 1927 Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern Library, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence in America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell Kent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927). The letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was used. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement Number One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch Press (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new venture were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers. Random House became the exclusive American distributor for books published by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel Press, the most important English private presses. \n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited edition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It was printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in spring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of Random House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper and 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed by Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the Bauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed by the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.” Rockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of publication. \n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock market crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing. \n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached Liveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former Boni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in January 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around the same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend Alfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927): \n\nSince I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a price on the business, Bennett having offered me \\$250,000 and I believe that he could be gotten to pay \\$300,000. I wrestled with my soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19, Wallerstein family folder). Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles from the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active titles to 139. All new ML titles except Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (138) were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate. \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, and the last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover. Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown. All new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with Bernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1 continued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles. 95 cents. (Spring) Hudson, *Purple Land* xHardy, *Jude the Obscure*. (Fall) Hardy, *Jude the Obscure* xDumas, *Three Musketeers*. The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint rights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930 and 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey, *Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238); Anatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How to Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to include *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the title *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344). \n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these were a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s *Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*, Lytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s *Abraham Lincoln*, O. Henry’s *The Trimmed Lamp*, and William McFee’s *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*. \n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles, including Henry James, *The Turn of the Screw* and *The American*; Santayana, *Soliloquies in England*; Turgenev, *A House* of *Gentlefolk*; Bunyan, *The Holy War*; Swift, *Gulliver’s Travels*; Mill, *On Liberty*; and Wells, *The Wheels of* *Chance* (Phelps to Cerf, 9 February 1927). Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published in the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The Philosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961. \n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to justify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26 May 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos: *Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and *U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s *Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that George was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf to Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927). \n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue Begins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of retail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML was sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major department stores. \n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone) offered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s *Maxims and Memoirs* for the ML (Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1928 1928 Boni & Liveright, Inc., became Horace Liveright, Inc., on 28 May. Boni had left the firm nearly nine years earlier, in July 1919. Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued ten titles, all but one of which were from the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active titles to 148. D’Annunzio, *Maidens of the Rocks* (1926), which Cerf and Klopfer added shortly after they took over the series, was the first title for which they had been responsible to be discontinued. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall lists. All new titles except France, *Revolt of the Angels* (163) were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). The first printing had a trim size of 6⅝ x 4½ in. (167 x 108 mm).  \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in.

Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine lettering in gold and the Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front cover. Bernhard Spring 1928 titles were the last published in uniform typographic jacket B2. A redesigned typographic jacket was introduced in September and modified in October. In addition to uniform typographic jackets, a limited number of titles were also available in pictorial jackets. The option of pictorial jackets may have been inspired by the 1928 Christmas Gift Box, which featured pictorial jackets printed in spring 1928. Pictorial jackets are rare; the number of titles available with pictorial jackets as well as uniform typographic jackets is unknown. Two examples are reproduced in the illustrations.  \n\nUniform typographic jacket C, which was completely redesigned except for the torchbearer on the spine and the horizontal bands near the top and foot, was introduced in September 1928 and used on only two titles, Rabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) and France, *Revolt of the Angels* (163). Both jackets were printed on pale yellow paper; series THE MODERN LIBRARY appeared in the lower. The paragraph of descriptive text that had been used on the front panel of ML jackets since 1917 was dropped completely. In its place was the title in large capitals that could be read easily from a distance of five or six feet, a torchbearer that was nearly twice the size of the torchbearer on uniform typographic jacket B2, and brief descriptive text in smaller type. The jacket for *The Revolt of the Angels* stated, “One of the five of Anatole France’s greatest books available in this edition”; that of *Gargantua and Pantagruel* stated, “Intelligently condensed into one volume by <span class=\"smallcaps\">prof. donald douglas</span> of Columbia University.” The colored rules did not make the books stand out on bookstore shelves, and uniform jacket C was replaced the following month by uniform typographic jacket D.  \n\nUniform typographic jacket D, introduced with the two October titles, Symonds, *Life of Michaelangelo Buonnaroti*(164) and *The Philosophy of Schopenhauer* (165), was a significant improvement. The new jackets differed from uniform typographic jacket C in two respects. The colored rules near the top and foot were extended to the upper and lower edges of the jacket, creating colored borders 7/16 inch wide which extended over the front and back panels, backstrip, and jacket flaps. And the jackets were printed in different color combinations. The borders were printed in deep reddish orange, moderate blue, or moderate yellowish green; the paper stock was light greenish blue, brilliant yellow, or pale yellow. Most booksellers displayed Modern Library books together. The vivid and varied colors of the jacket borders and paper stock significantly increased the visual appeal of groups of ML books displayed in book and department stores.  \n\nThe Modern Library printed new uniform jackets for the entire series, not just for newly published titles. First printings of *Gargantua and Pantagruel* and *Revolt of the Angels*, originally published in uniform typographic jacket C, are also found in uniform typographic jacket D.  \n\nThe text on the back panel of uniform typographic jackets C and D was also revised.  \n\nThe upper band which indicates the author on the front panel and spine, contains the following statement on the back panel:  \n\n> <center> <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern library</span> </center>\n><center> Books that have something to say </center>\n><center> to the Modern Mind </center>\n\nThe area between the upper and lower bands states:\n> <center> *How many* <span class=\"smallcaps\">modern library</span> *books* </center>\n> <center> *have you read?* </center>\n>A complete list of the 150 books in The Modern Library series will be found on the inside of the jacket. They are representative works by modern authors of the first rank, supplemented by a group of books that, although they were written centuries ago, are still *modern* in the full sense of the word. How many of these books have you read? How many are in your library? Handsome, durable, and inexpensive Modern Library editions enable them to be secured at a fraction of their usual cost. Jot down the numbers of volumes you desire on the coupon below. Give it to your bookseller. If there is no bookseller near you, the publisher will supply you.  \n\nLike uniform jacket B2, a complete list of Modern Library titles is printed inside uniform typographic jackets C and D. 95 cents. (*Spring*) Dumas, *Three Musketeers* xApuleius, *Golden Ass*. (*Fall*) Apuleius, *Golden Ass* xDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*. Cerf expressed interest in several titles published by Doubleday, Doran, including works by Joseph Conrad (*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Youth*, *Chance*, or *Nigger of the Narcissus*), Aldous Huxley (*Chrome Yellow* or *Antic Hay*), W. Somerset Maugham (*Of Human Bondage*, *The Moon and Sixpence*, or *The Trembling of a Leaf*), William McFee (*Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, *Command*, or *Casuals of the Sea*), and Horace Walpole (*Fortitude*). He offered the ML’s highest royalty—12 cents a copy—on any of these books (Cerf to Russell Doubleday, 25 April 1928), but Doubleday, Doran was not receptive. The Modern Library was able to include seven of these titles—*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Antic Hay*, *Of Human Bondage*, *Moon and Sixpence*, *Casuals of the Sea*, and *Fortitude*—in the early 1930s as a result of its purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. (See the introductory matter for 1930 for more information on the Sun Dial Library purchase.)  \n\nAnother author Cerf wanted in the ML was Ernest Hemingway. He told Hemingway, “We are very anxious indeed to add a book of yours to our Modern Library series” (Cerf to Hemingway, 29 October 1928). The ML was able to secure reprint rights to *The Sun Also Rises* and *A Farewell to Arms* in the early 1930s; *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* was added to ML Giants in 1942.  \n\nWhen Cerf told Sinclair Lewis that he wanted one if his books in the series, Lewis replied that the decision was up to Harcourt, Brace (Lewis to Cerf, 1928). The ML was able to add *Arrowsmith* in 1933 and three additional titles by Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s.  \n\nBernice Baumgarten of the literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested a ML edition of John Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers*, which had never appeared in a reprint edition (Baumgarten to Cerf, 6 March 1928). Cerf, who had previously declined to reprint Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*, replied, “We will not be interested in doing John Dos Passos’ ‘Three Soldiers’ in the Modern Library. I know the book well, and though I think it is an excellent piece of work, I do not feel that Dos Passos quite rates the Modern Library” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 7 March 1928). Cerf later changed his mind. Three books by Dos Passos were published in the ML in the 1930s: *Three Soldiers* (1932: 248), *The 42nd Parallel* (1937: 307), and *U.S.A.* (1939: G42).  \n\nCerf offered Harcourt, Brace an advance of \\$1,800 against royalties of 12 cents a copy for reprint rights to Lytton Strachey’s *Queen Victoria*, provided the ML could print from Harcourt plates (Cerf to Harrison Smith, 21 April 1928). Harcourt, Brace declined on the grounds that Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex*, published that year, would revive interest in the earlier work (Harrison Smith to Cerf, 11 May 1928). Strachey’s *Eminent Victorians* was added to the series in 1933.  \n\nCerf also wanted to include anthologies devoted to American poetry and English poetry. Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry, 1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology* (169.1), published early in 1928, was compiled for the Modern Library. Cerf sought permission to reprint John Drinkwater’s *Anthology of English Verse* (Houghton Mifflin, 1924), but the publisher rejected the offer (Curtis Brown to Cerf, 13 July 1928).  \n\nKlopfer offered a \\$4,000 advance against a royalty of 12 cents a copy for James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* (Klopfer to H. C. Latham, Macmillan, 27 November 1928). Despite subsequent offers, the book never appeared in the ML. Appleton declined Cerf’s offer of a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for Stephen Crane’s *Red Badge of Courage* (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928). The ML finally secured reprint rights to Crane’s novel fourteen years later.  \n\nE. Clark Stillman suggested a volume of Heinrich Heine’s poems for the ML and offered to do the translations (Stillman to ML, 15 June 1928). A reader suggested a volume of poetry by Alfred Noyes. Cerf replied to the latter suggestion, “. . . the idea is a mighty good one, and we shall investigate it at once” (Cerf to Mrs. R. G. Pattern, 29 October 1928). Nothing came of either suggestion. For the 1928 Christmas season the ML offered a boxed set titled *Three Renaissance Romances* consisting of three titles—Cellini, *Autobiography* (1927: 132), Merejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (1928: 154), and Symonds, *Life of Michelangelo* *Buonarroti* (1928: 164) in distinctive bindings and jackets. The bindings were brightly colored Keratol, a treated book cloth stamped in a geometric pattern, with the same gold stamping as other volumes of the period. The Cellini binding was light greenish blue (172), Merejkowski was vivid orange (48), Symonds was light yellowish green (135). Each jacket had an inset illustration printed in black on colored paper; the jackets are described in the entries for each title. Volumes in Keratol bindings have spring 1928 jackets and fall 1928 lists at the end of the volumes, except for Cellini which has no list. The retail price of each set was \\$2.85. Orders came mainly from department stores. Cerf noted after the Christmas season that the boxed set had proved so popular that it would be carried in stock regularly (Cerf to Desmond FitzGerald, 13 February 1929). This does not appear to have been done, but the *Three Renaissance Romances* gift box was offered again during the 1929 Christmas season.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1929 1929 With a few exceptions such as Villon, *Poems* (55) and *Passages from the Diary of Samuel Pepys* (89), the Boni & Liveright series remained true to its name and limited its scope to modern works. Cerf and Klopfer increased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added Defoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928 when Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and Rabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles published in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156), Smollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury Tales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of these works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them in the eyes of the shallowest modernist.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer were interested in publishing older classics besides those that appealed specifically to modernist readers, but they questioned whether the Modern Library was the appropriate vehicle for them. Responding to a list of suggestions for the ML in 1928, Klopfer commented, “The one that intrigues me most is the ‘Selected Poems of John Donne’, although I am not sure that he would fit into the *Modern* Library” (Klopfer to John W. Gassner, 22 March 1928).  \n\nFor a time they contemplated starting a separate series of older classics along the lines of Everyman’s Library. They scoured the lists of Everyman’s Library, Loeb Classical Library, and the “100 Best Books” for potential titles. The lists they compiled consisted mainly of standard works of classical and English literature, together with those of the Renaissance and, to a lesser extent, French literature. After considering various names for the series, they seem to have settled tentatively on the name Seven Seas Library; that at least is the name that appears most often in penciled memos from this period. Other names included Phoenix Library, Salamander Library, Pantheon Library, Mercury Library, and Random House Classics.  \n\nAnother possibility they considered was taking over an existing series of standard classics. In 1929 Cerf wrote to J. M. Dent & Co., the English publishers of Everyman’s Library, offering to distribute the series in the United States. American distribution of the series had been handled since its inception by E. P. Dutton Co. The relationship between the two firms was very close, and Dent had no interest in changing American distribution of the series (Cerf to Hugh R. Dent, 12 December 1929; Dent to Cerf, 1 January 1930). Cerf’s inquiry may have contributed to the soured relations between Dutton and the Modern Library that persisted for many years.  \n\nIn the end Cerf and Klopfer decided not to start a separate series of older classics. Many of the works listed as potential titles for the Seven Seas Library eventually found their way into the Modern Library.  \n\nAnother change in scope was that the Modern Library gradually lost its European orientation and became a series with neither European nor American authors seemingly outweighing the other. Signs of increased interest in American authors appeared soon after Cerf and Klopfer bought the series. A 1926 advertisement featuring photographs of Modern Library authors showed four Americans—Walt Whitman, Sherwood Anderson, James Branch Cabell, and Eugene O’Neill—and one European, Anatole France (ML advertisement, *New York Herald Tribune Books*, 7 November 1926). The Modern Library catalogue for 1927, announcing publication of *The Scarlet Letter*, stated: “The addition of this splendid novel is consistent with the avowed intention of the publishers to include in the Modern Library as many American authors as possible” (ML catalogue, Spring-Summer 1927).  \n\nAmerican authors were added regularly to the ML after 1925. No year went by without the publication of works by Americans, but the balance was not tipped suddenly in their favor. Of the twelve titles published in 1926, three were by Americans: Anderson, *Poor White* (121), Melville, *Moby-Dick* (124), and Lewisohn, *Up Stream* (128). The greatest concentration of Americans added to the series before 1930 came in 1927, when six out of nineteen new titles were by American authors.  \n\nAs with the inclusion of older classics, the new emphasis on American works did not become abundantly clear until the 1930s. The stock market crash of October 1929 ended seven years of prosperity, but the ML entered the Depression in a strong position. As Cerf wrote in 1929, “The Modern Library is no longer an experiment; it has become an institution in the book world. . . . These ubiquitous books . . . at one time or another have penetrated into nearly every American home and into the libraries of many readers in other countries” (“The Modern Library,” *Publishers’ Weekly*, 9 February 1929, p. 657; published anonymously but written by Cerf). Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen titles, bringing the total number of active titles to 167. No titles were discontinued. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall lists. All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).  \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type and the last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Adler’s title page was used with two different torchbearers. The six titles published January–March had torchbearer B; the thirteen titles published April-December reverted to Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2. The imitation leather bindings used since 1917 had never been altogether satisfactory. Castor oil used in manufacturing the imitation leather caused the bindings to emit a fishy odor in warm weather. Cerf and Klopfer began to think seriously about abandoning the imitation leather bindings in 1928. After experimenting with various binding cloths, they discovered a natural finish balloon cloth manufactured by the Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation that seemed to meet their requirements. They prepared samples of the new binding, with semi-flexible covers, and showed them to several leading booksellers and department store buyers. The response was favorable, and they decided to go ahead.  \n\nThe balloon cloth binding was officially introduced with the Modern Library’s January 1929 publications, Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry 1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology* (169) and Gustave Flaubert’s *Salammbô* (170). The old spine and cover design continued to be used through March, but this was a temporary expedient. Shortly after they decided to substitute balloon cloth for imitation leather, Cerf and Klopfer asked Rockwell Kent, who had created the Random House device in 1927, to make a “simple . . . but characteristic Kentian design for the back-strip” (Cerf to Kent, 11 December 1928). Kent more than fulfilled his commission. He not only drew a striking new spine for Modern Library book, but redesigned the torchbearer and created new endpapers as well.  \n\nKent began with the idea of putting the torchbearer at the base of the spine, but decided that the figure was too attenuated for the space available. Still, he felt that the torch idea should be kept and wanted to use a sizable spot of gold to make the spine distinctive. His first solution was a design incorporating a candle. To Klopfer he wrote:  \n\nAfter, I assure you, making more designs for that book-back than there are published works in the Modern Library; after considering and rejecting innumerable pictorial designs, nudes, phallic symbols, and so forth, as either inappropriate to book covers or indigestible to middle western and New England patrons of your publications; I have conceived and executed the somewhat trite, but I feel appropriate, device which I enclose, and if you feel that in employing a candle as part of it I have gone as far in suggestion as may be permitted, please realize that I have shown some restraint in not making that candle of the horrid dipped variety, so much in vogue in modern days (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929).  \n\nThe candle was never used. Cerf had warned Kent that the balloon cloth would not take readily every kind of design, and the candle may have been too detailed to be stamped clearly. At that point Kent decided that nothing could be done with the original design and discarded it.  \n\nThree weeks later he sent in an entirely new design. The new design, he noted, “should not only work out better in stamping but . . . in every way pleases me more” (Kent to Klopfer, 16 February 1929). Intended for the base of the spine, it consisted of an elegantly styled grape vine with intertwined branches, leaves, and bunches of grapes. Beneath the roots of the vine the words “Modern Library” were lettered in sans-serif capitals. Kent recommended that the lettering for the title and author at the head of the spine be drawn by hand. “You can get much more satisfactory spacing in that way,” he wrote. “There are innumerable professional letterers, any of whom can do this every month for you, promptly and at little cost” (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929). The ML does not appear to have adopted this suggestion.  \n\nFor the front cover of the binding Kent redrew Bernhard’s torchbearer. He thought Bernhard’s figure was “good in design, but too grotesque to be in keeping with the serious nature of the Modern Library.” Kent drew a more graceful, floating figure, with the torch, instead of being held aloft, carried in front of the runner with the flare trailing over the runner’s head. He omitted the words “Modern Library” which had encircled Bernhard’s figure on the grounds that it was sufficient to have them on the spine. He also made two other changes in the figure. Bernhard’s figure faced left, toward the spine. Kent thought this a violation of common sense and precedent in book design and turned it around. He also altered its sex. Bernhard’s figure was assumed to be feminine; around the Modern Library office it was known as “a dame running away from Bennett Cerf.” Kent made his version neuter. “I defy you to discover the figure’s sex,” he told Klopfer. “That’s modern enough for you” (ibid).  \n\nKent’s binding design was introduced with *The Cabala* by Thornton Wilder, the Modern Library’s April 1929 title. Bernhard’s torchbearer was not completely superseded by Kent’s figure. It never again appeared on the binding or endpaper, but it continued to be used on Modern Library title pages and on many of the jackets.  \n\nKent’s work for the Modern Library was a remarkable achievement in book design. The combination of smooth balloon cloth and Kent’s spine and front cover designs produced what were perhaps the handsomest volumes the Modern Library ever published. Unfortunately, Kent’s design appears to have been overly ambitious for books that retailed at ninety-five cents. The extra gold it required increased the Modern Library’s binding costs by half a cent per copy. That half cent doomed the design, and it was used in its complete form for less than two years.  \n\nThe balloon cloth bindings were available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown. The Modern Library published each title simultaneously in all four bindings. Two endpaper designs were used in 1929. Lucian Bernhard’s endpaper printed in light yellowish brown remained in use through March. A new endpaper designed by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April in conjunction with his new binding. Copies of the first printing of Thornton Wilder, *The Cabala* (175), which was published in April but probably printed in March, exist with both endpapers. The paste-down and free endpapers both featured Kent’s torchbearer at the center, surrounded by a pattern of open books and the initials “ml”. The conjunct endpapers were identical except that the two torchbearers faced each other. For the first year Kent’s endpapers were available in four different colors—light grayish red (18), dark yellowish pink (30), light reddish brown (42), and pale green (149)—and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth bindings. Red bindings had light grayish red endpapers, blue and green bindings had pale green endpapers, and brown bindings had dark yellowish pink or light reddish brown endpapers.  \n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were printed in moderate orange (53) and were used with all four binding colors. Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper, with the central panels with Kent’s torchbearer unchanged but with the surrounding pattern of open books and the initials “ml” extended to fill the larger space, was introduced in spring 1940. All 1929 titles except *The Memoirs of Casanova* (185) were originally published in uniform typographic jacket D. The Casanova jacket has an inset illustration of Casanova in left profile holding a candlestick in one hand and opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle casts a shadow of a satyr on the door. *The Memoirs of Casanova* appears to be the first ML title to have been published initially in a pictorial jacket without the option of a uniform typographic jacket.  \n\nAn unknown number of ML titles were available in optional pictorial jackets as well as the uniform typographic jacket. 95 cents. *Dating keys:* (Spring) Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* xChaucer, *Canterbury Tales*. (Fall) Chaucer, *Canterbury Tales* xHemingway, *Sun Also Rises*. Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel *All Quiet on the Western Front*, with sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929 best-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of \\$5,000 to \\$10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in the ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of *All Quiet on the Western Front* was published by Grosset & Dunlap, which distributed its hardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast, ML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and the book departments of major department stores.  \n\nIn another long shot, Cerf offered a \\$6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to Lowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his copyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive reprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.  \n\nCerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford’s novel *The Honorable Peter Stirling*, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset & Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book (Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley anthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11 December 1929).  \n\nHendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, *Tolerance* (Boni & Liveright, 1925), noting that it was “the sort of book to appeal to the free-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor” (Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press suggested André Tridon’s *Psychoanalysis*, originally published by B. W. Huebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both suggestions were rejected.  \n\nSeveral months after Edmond Rostand’s *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174) appeared in the ML, Duffield & Co. inquired if the ML would be interested in Rostand’s later play *Chantecler* or Paul Verlaines’s *Poems*. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in *The History of Mr. Polly* by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24 October 1929).  \n\nAlbert Mordell sent his book, *The Erotic Motive in Literature* (Boni & Liveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no place in the ML because its “appeal is special, and many statements that would have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today” (Cerf to Mordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell’s book revived in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier Books and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several translations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and the first decade of the twenty-first century. The ML produced three Christmas gift boxes in 1929. Each set consisted of three ML titles in a slipcase. The books had specially designed pictorial jackets and were advertised as “specially boxed and bound in gay colors, with picture jackets” (ML ad, *PW* 116, 21 September 1929, p. 1265). *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Modern Novels* were new; *Three Great Renaissance Romances* was first offered as a Christmas gift box in 1928. The Keratol bindings used in 1928 were replaced by colored balloon cloth which the ML had introduced as its standard binding earlier in the year. The pictorial jackets used for *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Renaissance Romances* were later adapted for use on regular ML printings. Hynd’s pictorial jackets for the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box were exceptional examples of expressionist graphics but may have been too edgy for the ML’s mainstream audience. Their use was limited to the 1929 gift box; they were never adapted for use on copies of the books sold separately. The retail price of each set was \\$2.85. The 1929 gift boxes were the last, though unsold boxes continued to be listed in ML catalogs. The three sets were:  \n\n1\\. *Three Great French Romances*: Zola, *Nana*; Gautier, *Mademoiselle de Maupin*; Flaubert, *Madame Bovary*.  \n2\\. *Three Great Renaissance Romances:* Cellini, *Autobiography*; Merejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*; Symonds, *Life of Michelangelo*.  \n\n3\\. *Three Great Modern Novels*: Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*; Butler, *Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *Return of the Native*.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1930 1930 The Modern Library’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in hard-cover reprints, was announced on 4 April. The Sun Dial Library had been in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary works similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it included fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun Dial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American series that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf regarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April 1930).  \n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library gave the Modern Library access to a number of titles that Cerf and Klopfer had tried to secure from Doubleday in the past. The series included major works by Joseph Conrad, Aldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, William McFee, and Christopher Morley, all of whom were Doubleday authors. Other desirable titles in the series included Katherine Mansfield’s *Garden Party*, Bram Stoker’s *Dracula*, and H. G. Wells’s *Tono-Bungay*.  \n\nAs part of the agreement the Modern Library secured reprint rights to four Doubleday titles—Arnold Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Aldous Huxley’s *Point Counter Point*, W. Somerset Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage*, and Horace Walpole’s *Fortitude*—that were not part of the Sun Dial Library. Cerf and Klopfer had been trying to secure reprint rights to these titles for several years. The Modern Library agreed to pay Doubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy for these four titles—two cents more than Cerf and Klopfer were then paying for any other book in the ML with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men* (159). The four titles were added to the Modern Library between September 1930 and January 1931.  \n\nEleven of the 53 titles in the Sun Dial Library were added to the ML between 1931 and 1937: Conrad, *Lord Jim* (210); Mansfield, *The Garden Party* (214); Morley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (213); McFee, *Casuals of the Sea* (223); Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225); Stoker, *Dracula* (231); Conrad, *Victory* (238); Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (248); Huxley, *Antic Hay* (233); Maugham, *Moon and Sixpence* (283); and Collins, *The Moonstone* (G31). All of these except *The Moonstone* appear to have been protected by copyright and could not have been included in the ML without the permission of Doubleday, Doran.  \n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library was a straight cash transaction. The Modern Library acquired the entire stock of Sun Dial Library books, about 87,000 volumes, and got the right for five years to add any title from the series for which Doubleday, Doran controlled the copyright. No plates were involved since Garden City Publishing Co., like other reprint publishers, printed from the original publishers’ plates. The total cost was just under \\$25,000. This represented the exact manufacturing cost of each volume, a royalty of ten cents a copy, and an additional payment of \\$5,000.  \n\nThe books were transferred to the Modern Library’s warehouse at the Wolff Bindery in New York. Cerf estimated that no more than half of the books could be sold at full price. Cerf and Klopfer hoped at first to sell enough books at the regular price to enable them to remainder the rest at the end of the year and still break even (Cerf to Crowder, 10 April 1930). Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, the big New York department stores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them at sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to 60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned the idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were being offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55 percent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big account in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but Cerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J. Smalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931).  \n\nOther ways were found to dispose of the weakest titles. Many of them were bartered for Modern Library advertising in college newspapers, and several booksellers agreed to accept Sun Dial Library books as the Modern Library’s contribution toward cooperative advertising. By September 1933 the Sun Dial Library stock was almost gone.  \n\nCerf commented to the ML’s senior sales representative, “Considering the general depression, our Modern Library sales seem to be holding up wonderfully. The new picture jackets help, and the Fall additions should cause general satisfaction, I believe” (Cerf to Crowder, 11 July 1930).  \n\nThe ML ordered new typesettings and plates for three of its most popular titles: Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Bennett, *Old Wives Tale* (207), and Stoker, *Dracula* (231).  \n\nErnest Hemingway paid tribute to the ML’s format in December 1930. He had shattered his arm in a serious car accident in early November and was recuperating in Key West after spending seven weeks in a Billings, Montana hospital. In a letter to Cerf typed by his wife Pauline he gratefully described Modern Library books as “the proper size for one-handed reading” (Hemingway to Cerf, 26 December 1930). Nineteen titles were added and four were discontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 182. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall lists. Fall 1930 jackets also list Merejkowski, *Peter and Alexis* (227), which was originally announced for August 1930 but was delayed until December 1931. All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).  \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). Except for Rockwell Kent’s *Wilderness* (205) all new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type and torchbearer A2, A3, or C1 (see individual entries). *Wilderness* had an individually designed title page featuring an illustration by Kent; torchbearer B appears on the verso of the title page. Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each title published in all four bindings. See the illustration of Huysmans, *Against the Grain*, which shows four copies of the fall 1930 first printing, each in a binding of a different color.  \n\nRockwell Kent’s B1 binding with the grape vine design at the base of the spine and his torchbearer stamped in gold on the front panel was used in its full form through spring 1930. The additional gold required for the B1 binding increased the ML’s costs by half a cent per volume, and the binding was discontinued after a single season.  \n\nThe balloon cloth B2 binding was used for the first seven titles published in fall 1930. The B2 binding is identical to B1 except for the torchbearer, which is blind stamped on the front panel. Titles published initially in the B2 binding are Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (197), Mencken, *Selected Prejudices* (198), Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Goethe, *Faust* (200), Walpole, *Fortitude* (201), Young, *The Medici* (202), and Huxley, *Point Counter Point* (203).  \n\nBalloon cloth binding C replaced Kent’s original design for the last three titles published in 1930: Plato, *Works* (204), Kent, *Wilderness* (205), and Huysmans, *Against the Grain* (206). Kent’s grape vine design is omitted from the spine, but his torchbearer, reduced in size from 36 to 27 mm, is again stamped in gold on the front panel. Balloon cloth binding C was used through April 1931 and was superseded by balloon cloth binding D in May 1931.  \n\nEarly in 1930 Klopfer asked H. Wolff, the ML’s bindery, to look into the potential savings of using imitation gold (“oriental tissue”) instead of genuine gold on the bindings, noting that it would have to save at least a penny per book to make the change worthwhile (Klopfer to Bert Wolff, 23 January 1930). Wolff indicated that imitation gold would save .003 per copy or \\$3.00 per thousand—a savings of \\$1,500–1,800 a year (Wolff to Klopfer, 20 January 1930). As a test Klopfer asked that the ML’s May title, *Oriental Romances* (196), be stamped in imitation gold. Wolff mistakenly used imitation gold on the ML’s entire current binding order of 118,404 volumes instead of genuine gold as specified in the contract (RH Box 766, Wolff folder). Balloon cloth binding B2 with the torchbearer blind stamped on the front panel appears to have been the solution to the problem. Twenty-five ML titles were offered in special bindings for the library market. The flexible balloon cloth bindings used for volumes sold in stores did not withstand repeated readings and thus were not well suited to library use. Volumes in the “Library Edition” were bound in sturdy blue buckram over stiff boards with headbands at the head and foot of the spine. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings in the regular ML, the bindings were reinforced with mull, also known as crash—a strip of sturdy starched fabric that was glued over the folded gatherings at the spine, with flaps extending about half an inch on each side that were glued to the inside of the front and back boards. The titles were:  \n\n*American Poetry* *1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology*, ed. Aiken (169.1) \nBeebe, *Jungle Peace* (116) \n*Best Ghost Stories* (67) \n*Best Russian Short Stories*, ed. Seltzer (18) \nBrontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120) \nCarroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, The Hunting of the Snark* (111) \nCellini, *Autobiography* (132) \nDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (171) \nDouglas, *South Wind* (114) \n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed. Starrett (155) \nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (21) \nHardy, *Return of the Native* (126) \nHudson, *Green Mansions* (90) \nIbsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People* (6) \nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (128) \nMelville, *Moby Dick* (124)\nMeredith, *Diana of the Crossways* (14) \nMeredith, *Ordeal of Richard Feverel* (144) \nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154) \nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (9) \nSchreiner, *Story of an African Farm* (142) \nSterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158) \nSymonds, *Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti* (164) \nWilde, *Picture of Dorian Gray* (1) \nWilde, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan* (76)  \n\nFifteen of the titles were ones that Cerf and Klopfer added between fall 1925 and 1928; ten had originally appeared in the Boni & Liveright series. The attempt to market ML books to libraries was not a success, probably because the small size of the volumes and the narrow margins did not allow for rebinding.  \n\nBuckram bindings for the library market were again made available for many ML titles in the 1960s, more than twenty years after the ML introduced its larger format. This time the optional buckram bindings appear to have been successful. Rockwell Kent endpapers used in spring 1930 were available in three different colors and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth bindings. Blue and green bindings continued to be paired with pale green (149) endpapers; brown bindings examined had light reddish brown (42) endpapers; and red bindings had endpapers in light orange (52).  \n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for the oversize volume, John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935: 280) and three spring 1939 titles—Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317), Isak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales* (320), and *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) that were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space. Ten of the 1930 titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets. Seven appeared in uniform typographic jacket D. Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199) was published in uniform typographic jacket E; Huxley, *Point Counter Point* (203) had a non-pictorial jacket designed by E. McKnight Kauffer. 95 cents. (Spring) Hemingway, *Sun Also Rises* xGoethe, *Faust*. (Fall) Goethe, *Faust* xConrad, *Lord Jim*. Cerf wanted to include John Galsworthy’s *Forsyte Saga* in the Modern Library but realized that Scribner’s was unlikely to grant reprint rights. He wrote Maxwell Perkins in 1930, “I eagerly await hearing of Mr. Scribner’s reaction to my suggestion for the *Forsyte Saga*. I hope that I did not move him to physical violence. I am convinced the idea is not as ridiculous as it very likely appears at first blush” (Cerf to Perkins, 4 December 1930). Perkins replied that there was no possibility of granting reprint rights (Perkins to Cerf, 4 December 1930). Nine years later Cerf offered an advance of \\$7,500 to publish *The Forsyte Saga* as a Giant (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939). Galsworthy’s sequence of three novels and two interludes never appeared in the ML.  \n\nCerf contacted John W. Luce & Co. about rights to a John Millington Synge anthology (Cerf to Mr. Schaff, 23 June 1930). Cerf contacted Longman’s for the rights to H. Rider Haggard’s *She*, J. C. Van Dyke’s *History of Painting*, and G. F. Young’s history from 44 B.C. to 1453 A.D., *East and West through Fifteen Centuries* (Cerf to J. Ray Beck, 25 September 1930). The only one of these titles that was ever added to the ML was *She*—and that was over 25 years later, when Haggard’s *She & King Solomon’s Mines* (492) appeared in the ML in 1957.  \n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West, suggested Goethe’s *Faust* and *The Sayings of Confucius* (Crowder to Cerf, 12 April 1930 and 30 September 1930). *Faust* (200) was published in the ML that fall. *The Wisdom of Confucius* (312) appeared in the ML in 1938 and became one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. V. F. Calverton, who edited *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183) for the ML in 1929, offered to edit *Tales of E. T. A. Hoffman* for the series; Cerf indicated that the book was a possibility in the future (Cerf to Calverton, 10 December 1930).  \n\nThe ML decided not to publish Guillaume Apollinaire’s *La Rome des Borgia* after a reader’s report judged it pornographic and valueless as history. The reader commented, “The whole simply stinks of obscenity and abnormality” (“Ray” to Klopfer, 18 February 1930).  \n\nFerris Greenslet urged Cerf to publish a ML edition of Alain-Fournier’s novel *The Wanderer* (*Le Grand Meaulnes*), which was originally published in Paris in 1913 and appeared in an English translation published by Houghton Mifflin in 1928, fourteen years after the young author’s death in action in the First World War. “I hope very much that you are going to feel like doing something about THE WANDERER, both because we would like the business and because I personally have a profound interest in extending the reputation of Alain Fournier” (Greenslet to Cerf, 5 September 1930). Cerf appears to have been skeptical about its sales potential. Roger L. Scaife, who would move from Houghton Mifflin to Little, Brown & Co. a short time later, replied to Cerf: “You may be right about THE WANDERER. The story took hold of us here so strongly that we thought it a gem that should be preserved and sold year after year. Whether that is possible or not, I do not know. Your judgment is understandably better than mine in this case” (Scaife to Cerf, 6 October 1930). A new English translation by Frank Davison was published in 1959 under the title *The Lost Domain* by Oxford University Press in its World’s Classics series and reprinted in Penguin Modern Classics as *Le Grand Meaulnes* in 1966. A third English translation by Robin Buss appeared in Penguin Classics in 2007 under the title *The Lost Estate*.  \n\nThe Marxist poet and novelist Isidor Schneider, who was in charge of advertising at Horace Liveright, Inc., and whose wife, Helen Berlin, had been Cerf and Klopfer’s first secretary, recommended Ivan Goncharov’s *Oblomov* for the ML. The Natalie Duddington translation, published by Macmillan the previous year, was the first complete translation in English. Schneider, who later served as literary editor of the *New Masses*, considered *Oblomov* one of the world’s ten best novels (Schneider to Cerf, 1 April 1930; Schneider Special Manuscript Collection, Columbia University Library). The Duddington translation was published in Everyman’s Library in 1932, but *Oblomov* was never added in the ML.

The Sun Dial Library had been in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary works similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it included fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun Dial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American series that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf regarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April 1930). [object Object]",

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1931 1931 It took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest levels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales fluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears to have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream books sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML sales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for September 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s history up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).  \n\nModern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to include works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to accommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in fall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3). The Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm) with hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the volumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for one dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were ideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate success.  \n\nIn contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and Klopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint collapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers for their collections. One collector, whose library included a large number of Kelmscott Press books, including *The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer*, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden Cockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically everything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales representatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was asked for suggestions, he could only reply, “I don’t know a soul who wants to buy a lot of press books today” (Carl Smalley to Cerf and Klopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933 Random House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of the original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells’s *Time Machine* designed by W. A. Dwiggins (\\$12.50 list) was available for \\$2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne (\\$42.00 list) was reduced to \\$10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides (\\$85.00 list) was \\$15.00.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under the Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for “specials” intended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML plates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on good quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt tops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of \\$2.50. The venture was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title were printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in major cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did not do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that they would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 “was one of those years when even \\$2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to Cerf, 18 August 1932).  \n\nRH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but the books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML plates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50 cents. Twenty-one titles were added to the regular ML in 1931 and five were discontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 198. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on inside panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall lists. The new ML Giants series was introduced in fall 1931 with three titles: Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3). All new titles except Conrad, *Lord Jim* (230) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Lord Jim* was 6⅞ x 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm) with the leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in. (171 x 113 mm).  \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type and torchbearer A2, A3, or A6 (see individual entries). Beginning in January 1931 Cerf and Klopfer added their names to the imprint:  \n\n<center>BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER </center>\n<center> T H E  M O D E R N  L I B R A R Y </center> \n<center>NEW YORK </center>\n\nThe imprints of three 1931 titles—Fielding, *History of Tom Jones* (208), Boccaccio, *Decameron* (209), and Balzac, *Droll Stories* (221)—differed from the standard format. *The History of Tom Jones* had a colon instead of a dot between Cerf and Klopfer’s names; *The Decameron* and *Droll Stories* reverted to the two-line format without Cerf and Klopfer’s names.  \n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding C, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and the 2-line imprint MODERN LIBRARY stamped in gold at the base of the spine, was used through April 1931. Balloon cloth binding D, with the front panel as binding C and the stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine, was introduced in May and remained in use through spring 1939.  \n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all four bindings.  \n\nThe Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation, which supplied some or all of the ML’s balloon cloth, decided to liquidate. Holliston Mills, Inc., took over Siegbert’s stock, trademarks, and patent rights. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space. Twelve of the 1931 titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets. Five were published in uniform typographic jacket D and three in uniform typographic jacket E. The individually designed jacket of Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225) features the 2-line title sandwiched between six strong yellow green bands, simulating a barrel labeled TONO BUNGAY. 95 cents. (Spring) Conrad, *Lord Jim* xBalzac, *Droll Stories*. (Fall) Balzac, *Droll Stories* xDreiser, *Sister Carrie*; Giants through G3. Cerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* in the ML, possibly as a replacement for *Soldiers* *Three* which was dropped from the series in 1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran was not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17 February 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. *Kim* (433) did not appear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams, *Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres*, the trade edition of which was originally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there was very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced edition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931). Herschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co., asked why Gogol’s *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead Souls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to it. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf, undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). *Dead Souls* (290) was published in the ML in 1936.  \n\nCerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur Schnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a potential replacement for Schnitzler’s novel *Bertha Garlan* (38) which was discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a collection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title *Little Novels* in 1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or Cerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology *Great German Short Novels and Stories* (256), published in April 1933, he included Schnitzler’s story “The Fate of the Baron” from the Simon and Schuster collection.  \n\nCerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon’s *Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man*, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was interested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML’s format, and he had reservations about Sassoon’s popularity in the United States. He eventually declined: “Maybe something will come along to increase Sassoon’s popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will allow us to reopen negotiations on this book” (Cerf to Coward, 10 February 1931; 9 July 1931).  \n\nR. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested *Wolfgang Goethe*, a two-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML Giants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied, “Cheers! What a <u>lousy</u> idea” (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931; underlining in original).  \n\nWhen M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion of a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, “I have the very definite feeling that ed. & Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of the reprints of Mr. Bromfield’s books” (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October 1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar & Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell’s *Moon-Calf*, *The Briary-Bush*, or *Janet March*, which were then the property of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, “I frankly don’t think that Dell’s old books are read widely enough today to justify their inclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be belonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I wrong?” (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22 December 1931).

Modern Library sales fluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears to have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream books sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML sales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for September 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s history up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).

Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine printing business, Pynson Printers, and to *The Colophon*, the bibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random House was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library, Inc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933, following the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing.  \n\nML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide exceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes published in 1932 sold for \\$1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages per volume.  \n\nThe ML published a full-page ad in *Publishers’ Weekly* that lampooned the publishing industry adage, “You can’t sell books like soap.” Adapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed “They Float!” and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with five Modern Library books—*Of Human Bondage*, *Swann’s Way*, *The Magic Mountain*, *Droll Stories*, and *Sanctuary*—floating on the surface of the water (*PW*, 14 May 1932, p. 2015). Twenty-four titles were added and fifteen were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 207. Six of the discontinued titles (two by Maupassant and four by Wilde) were repackaged as three volumes to offer better value. Chekhov, *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories*, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more comprehensive collection, *The Stories of Anton Tchekov*, edited by Robert Linscott). Three new titles in ML Giants, including Gibbon, *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* in two volumes, brought the number of Giants to six titles in seven volumes. *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* was expanded to three volumes in 1946. All new titles except Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* (230) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Sister Carrie* was ¼ in. taller.  \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; all but three had torchbearer A2. Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (228) had torchbearer A3; Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (248) had torchbearer C1; *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* (244) had no torchbearer on the title page. All new titles except *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had the 3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:  \n\n<center> BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER </center>  \n<center> T H E  M O D E R N  L I B R A R Y </center> \n<center>  NEW YORK  </center>\n\nThe title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text that there was no room for a torchbearer or Cerf and Klopfer’s names.  \n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine.  \n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all four bindings. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space. Eighteen of the 1932 titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets. Four were published in uniform typographic jacket D and two in uniform typographic jacket F. Nearly all new titles published between 1932 and the introduction of the ML’s larger format in fall 1939 had pictorial jackets. Uniform typographic jacket D was used on newly published titles for the last time in spring 1932. The final examples of its use, *Poems of Longfellow* (235) and Franklin, *Autobiography and Selections from His Other Writings* (236), provoked an angry letter from Cerf, who had apparently given instructions that the jacket was no longer to be used for new titles. 95 cents. (Spring) Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* xDickens, *Pickwick Papers*; Giants through G5. (Fall) Dickens, *Pickwick Papers* xLewis, *Arrowsmith*; Giants through G7. Cerf approached Arthur Pell at Liveright, Inc., about including a volume of plays by Eugene O’Neill in ML Giants (Cerf to Pell, 16 November 1932). Nothing came of this initiative. O’Neill became a Random House author the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O’Neill’s *Nine Plays* (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added to the Giants in 1941.  \n\nAfter repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs, the president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the president of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML reprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, “We are simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a cheap edition we would do it ourselves” (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).  \n\nCerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge plays, saying “If we can’t get this from you by peaceable means in the next two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston underworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with lighted matches until you sign on the dotted line” (Cerf to Schaff, 16 November 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to *Kim* (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to consider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.  \n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West, suggested Edmund Wilson’s *Axel’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative Literature of 1870–1930*, which had been published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with Wilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested adding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed publishing under a new title such as *Literary Essays* or *Essays on Modern Authors*. He also asked for an advance of \\$500 (Wilson to Cerf, 28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays he had considered adding to *Axel’s Castle* into a new book (Wilson to Cerf, 6 November 1933).  \n\nDale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a one-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm of Albert & Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes comprising Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, would welcome some ready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in 1930, and the firm “was in major trouble” by the early 1930s (“Albert and Charles Boni” in *American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980*, p. 57).  \n\nThe ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, *Swann’s Way* (1928) and *Within a Budding Grove* (1930), and would add *Guermantes Way* in 1933. Cerf thought that Warren’s suggestion was an excellent idea except from the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked Warren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris Greenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. “We have had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire Proust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might be able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that anything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as possible. Something <u>must</u> break in this situation before the summer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining in original). Five months later he indicated, “I have not given up hopes of buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything develops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you immediately” (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure *Remembrance of Things Past* a year or so later. The Random House edition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf described it as “one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934” (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 99).  \n\nWarren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of Proust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but added that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust if the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather’s *My Antonia*, which he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to Warren, 13 September 1943).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1933 1933 *Publishers’ Weekly* reported that the Modern Library’s best-selling books for 1933 showed “a distinct change in the trend of interest of readers. For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles, like ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most interesting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’ edited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is still selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers for the year were: Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*, Faulkner, *Sanctuary*, Marx, *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings*, Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*, Maugham, *Of Human Bondage*, Mann, *The Magic Mountain*, Merejkowski, *The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*, Dostoyevsky, *The Brothers Karamazov*, Cather, *Death Comes for the Archbishop*, and Rostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (“Modern Library Best Sellers,” *PW*, 13 January 1934, p. 148).   \n\nCerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing in 1933 after the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The firm had been through many changes since Albert Boni’s departure in July 1918. The name Boni & Liveright was used until fall 1928, three years after Cerf and Klopfer’s purchase of the Modern Library deprived the firm of its most reliable source of income. The change of name to Horace Liveright, Inc., was largely due to confusion with the firm, Albert & Charles Boni, which the Boni brothers established in 1923.   \n\nLiveright borrowed money repeatedly from Arthur Pell, the firm’s treasurer, giving him stock in the firm as collateral. By 1930 he had lost control of the firm of which he had been co-founder. When Pell emerged as the firm’s majority shareholder he forced Liveright to leave. Liveright moved to Hollywood where he worked briefly at Paramount and then Pathé Studios before returning to New York in the summer of 1931, where he died two years later at the age of forty-nine. In December 1931 Pell changed the name of the firm to Liveright, Inc. Pell did what he could to avert the slide into bankruptcy, but on 4 May 1933 three of its creditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the firm (Gilmer, pp. 232-33). Other publishers rushed in to sign up the leading Liveright authors. Robinson Jeffers received thirteen telegrams from publishers the day the bankruptcy was announced (Melrich V. Rosenberg to Cerf, 17 September 1933). Even more sought after was Eugene O’Neill, whose plays, Cerf once noted, “sold like novels” (Gelb and Gelb, p. 768). Cerf set out to get both authors, though he thought the odds against getting O’Neill were about fifteen to one (Cerf to Crowder, 23 May 1933).   \n\nO’Neill relied on his friend Saxe Commins, who had recently become his editor at Liveright, to advise him on the choice of a new publisher. After examining the offers, Commins indicated a preference for Cerf and Random House. As he explained later,   \n\n> The reason for the choice was that I had known Bennett professionally during the Liveright days and recognized in him the potential of an imaginative, resourceful, adventurous and most trustworthy publisher. From my first meeting with his partner, Donald S. Klopfer, I was impressed by his quiet confidence, his reliability, and his good sense. Subsequently . . . I was to learn of his many attributes, not the least of which is his complete selflessness (Commins, quoted in Dorothy Commins, *What Is an Editor?*, p. 26).   \n\nCerf was invited to fly down to Sea Island, Georgia, to meet with O’Neill and Commins. O’Neill signed with Random House in June; Jeffers signed a day or so later. One of the first acts of the reorganized Liveright Publishing Corporation was to deliver the plates of its books by O’Neill and Jeffers to the ML’s printers (Liveright Publishing, Inc., to the Modern Library, Inc., 9 August 1933; reproduced in Egleston, pp. 107–08).   \n\nCerf and Klopfer also considered trying to get Theodore Dreiser, the most important novelist on the Liveright list. After O’Neill and Jeffers signed with Random House Klopfer composed a letter to Dreiser making an offer, but the letter, dated 20 June 1933, appears never to have been sent. The original as well as the carbon copy remains in the Random House Collection at Columbia University. One can only speculate why Cerf and Klopfer changed their minds. Cerf did not like Dreiser personally, and Dreiser was a notoriously difficult author to deal with. He distrusted publishers in general and Jewish publishers in particular. In the end, over a year after the Liveright bankruptcy, he signed with Simon and Schuster. He completed nothing of importance during the eight acrimonious years he remained with the firm. By 1939 he owed Simon and Schuster over ten thousand dollars in unearned advances and other charges (Madison, p. 108).   \n\nIn addition to O’Neill and Jeffers, Random House acquired the editorial services of Saxe Commins. One of O’Neill’s conditions for coming to Random House was that his editor come with him. Random House needed a full-time editor if it was to become seriously involved in trade publishing, and Commins was developing into one of the best book editors of his generation. Already the editor of Eugene O’Neill, at Random House he was to become renowned as the editor of William Faulkner and also of W. H. Auden, Isak Dinesen, Sinclair Lewis, James Michener, Budd Schulberg, Irwin Shaw, Stephen Spender, and many others. Commins started at Random House on 9 July 1933 and remained editor-in-chief until his death in 1958, a quarter of a century later.   \n\nAfter merging two volumes by Maupassant into one and four volumes by Wilde into two in 1932, the ML continued its efforts to make ML books a better value by adding *Erewhon Revisited* to its edition of Samuel Butler’s *Erewhon* (146b). Thirteen new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 211. Five new titles were published in ML Giants series; by the end of 1933 the Giants included eleven titles in twelve volumes. All new titles except Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Arrowsmith* was ⅜ inch taller and wider to accommodate the Harcourt, Brace plates.   \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.   \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; torchbearer A2 was used on all but two new titles. Ludwig, *Napoleon* (255) had torchbearer A7 and Louÿs, *Aphrodite* (257) had torchbearer C2. All new titles had the 3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:   \n\n<center> BENNETT A.

KLOPFER </center>  \n<center> T H E  M O D E R N  L I B R A R Y </center>\n<center> NEW YORK  </center> \n\nThe imprint of Louÿs, *Aphrodite* (257) differs from other 1933 titles in the first line of the imprint, which has a colon rather than a dot between Cerf and Klopfer’s names.   \n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine.   \n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all four bindings.

An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space. All newly published titles had individually designed pictorial jackets except Gertrude Stein’s *Three Lives* (261) which had a distinctive non-pictorial jacket designed by Ernst Reichl. Reichl was also responsible for designing the Random House edition of Joyce’s *Ulysses*, published in January 1934.   \n\nBeginning in August with Brontë, *Jane Eyre* (160), descriptive text about the work replaced generic information about the series on the front jacket flaps of newly published ML titles. The flap text was written by Saxe Commins, who joined the firm as editor in July. 95 cents. (Spring) Lewis, *Arrowsmith* xStein, *Three Lives*; Giants through G10. (Fall) Stein, *Three Lives* xCaldwell, *God’s Little Acre*; Giants through G12; jackets: 225 (=spring, fall 1934). Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include George Bernard Shaw’s plays in the ML and offered Dodd, Mead a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for a volume consisting of *Man and Superman*, *St. Joan*, and *Androcles and the Lion* (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 8 February 1933). Shaw opposed inexpensive reprints of his works and kept tight control of his copyrights, and it was only after his death in 1950 that the ML was able to include two volumes of his plays. (Shaw temporarily relaxed his opposition to cheap reprints in 1946, when he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.) The only work by Shaw that appeared in the ML during his lifetime was his early novel, *An Unsocial Socialist* (15), which was published before the U.S. extended copyright protection to the works of foreign authors.   \n\nWilla Cather was another author who was ambivalent about inexpensive reprints of her works. She allowed *Death Comes to the Archbishop* (219) to be included in the Modern Library in 1931 but subsequently asked Knopf not to renew the reprint contract. When Cerf tried to add Cather’s *My Antonia* to the series in 1933 Houghton Mifflin turned him down, probably at Cather’s request (Dale Warren to Cerf, 30 October 1933).   \n\nCerf contacted Farrar and Rinehart about including Hervey Allen’s *Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants in 1935 or 1936 (Cerf to John Farrar, 11 August 1933). The historical novel sold 300,000 copies in its first six months and led the fiction best-seller list for two years (1933‑1934). Farrar and Rinehart does not appear to have authorized any reprint edition, not even by Grosset & Dunlap, the leading publisher of reprint editions for the mass market before the advent of paperbacks in 1939. Cerf waited for five years and tried again in 1938 (see 1938 Titles sought, suggested, declined).   \n\nCerf expressed interest in reprinting Ogden Nash’s selection from P. G. Wodehouse’s works, *Nothing but Wodehouse* (Doubleday, Doran, 1932), possibly as a Giant—the volume ran to more than 1,000 pages—but Doubleday, Doran was reprinting it in a cheap edition of their own.   \n\nOn a different note, Klopfer asked Max Eastman, whose Marx’s *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings* (246) had been published in the ML three months earlier, to translate the complete works of Lenin for the ML, noting that it would be “a perfect follow-up book for the Marx” and “would create a great feeling of ill-will in this country, all of which we are very much for.” Five days later he wrote, “I am waiting with baited breath to hear the length of the complete works of Lenin, when you would be able to do it, and how much you would want to do a new translation” (Klopfer to Eastman, 16 February and 21 February 1933). Eastman replied that a volume of Lenin could be any length. He asked for an advance of five hundred dollars and a fee of one cent per word for the translation. He noted, “Lenin’s style is an extraordinary phenomenon—you can feel the locomotive force of the man’s will in almost every sentence—and it has never been reproduced in English” (Eastman to Klopfer, 16 March 1933). Klopfer responded that the ML would like a book of about 100,000 words (Klopfer to Eastman, 17 March 1933).   \n\nEastman received the advance he asked for, but nearly a year went by before he began working on the Lenin book. Cerf wrote in April 1934, “These are times in which that book could sell marvelously well, and it would be a shame to dilly-dally until somebody beats us to the gun. I beseech you to get to work on it” (Cerf to Eastman, 4 April 1934). But Eastman made little progress. Other work got in the way, and in August he wrote to Cerf agreeing to an annulment of the contract. Eastman kept the advance, which they agreed would be regarded as an advance for a future project (Eastman to Cerf, 30 August 1934). Cerf and Klopfer gave up the idea of including a Lenin volume in the ML. The only subsequent book of Eastman’s to be published by Random House was *Love and Revolution: My Journey through an Epoch* (1964)*.*   \n\nRobert de Graff, the president of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary Garden City Publishing Co., suggested Clemence Dane’s novel *Legend* for the ML. Dane was the pseudonym of the English novelist, playwright, and screenwriter Winifred Ashton. Cerf replied that he didn’t think she would have much of a sale in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 27 January 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 30 January 1933). Michael S. Mill, a publisher’s sales representative, suggested a volume of Anthony Trollope; Cerf replied that the ML would get around to it in the next couple of years (Cerf to Mill, 28 July 1933). Trollope’s *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (292) was added to the ML in 1936.   \n\nFollowing the publication of Keats and Shelley’s *Complete Poetical Works* (G4) in the new ML Giants series, Cerf and Klopfer considered a Giant devoted to the complete poems of Lord Byron. Robert Linscott of Houghton Mifflin Co. provided sales figures for the firm’s Cambridge Edition of *The Complete Poetical Works* *of Lord Byron* (1905). Trade sales for the three-year period 1930–32 totaled 1370 copies. Klopfer thanked him and noted, “I think that that conclusively proves we would not be warranted in making a Giant of a complete Byron” (Klopfer to Linscott, 13 April 1933). The ML published Byron’s *Don Juan* (420) in 1949 and *Selected Poetry* (465) in 1954.

For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles, like ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most interesting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’ edited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is still selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers for the year were: Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*, Faulkner, *Sanctuary*, Marx, *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings*, Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*, Maugham, *Of Human Bondage*, Mann, *The Magic Mountain*, Merejkowski, *The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*, Dostoyevsky, *The Brothers Karamazov*, Cather, *Death Comes for the Archbishop*, and Rostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (“Modern Library Best Sellers,” *PW*, 13 January 1934, p. 148).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1934 1934 Cerf and Klopfer published the first authorized American edition of James Joyce’s *Ulysses* in January 1934. The book appeared under the Random House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The Modern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of the firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back copies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and Company, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate Sylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and tourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at customs.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell *Ulysses* before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of the Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the work bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to be seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and attorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random House. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized the literary stature of *Ulysses* and concluded that “nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into the United States was overturned.  \n\nThe Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey’s decision, a foreword by Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at \\$3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH edition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over \\$30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). *Ulysses* (G50) was added to ML Giants in 1940.  \n\nOther trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint included a four-volume edition of Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, Gertrude Stein’s *Four Saints in Three Acts*, volumes of poetry by W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play *Merrily We Roll Along*, and William Saroyan’s *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze*. All ML books before 1934 appear to have been printed from letterpress plates. Letterpress is a relief technology. The printing surface is raised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal, Linotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which is cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface is inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates cast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the nineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than one printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of standing type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was a metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each page allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways, depending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or thirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early 1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was likely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus saving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher anticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The ML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings. All ML books were printed from plates.  \n\nWhen the ML reprinted copyrighted works it tried whenever possible to use the original publisher’s letterpress plates or duplicates of the original plates. The original plates were usually designed for a full-sized trade edition, not the ML’s compact format. This explains why many ML books printed from the original publisher’s plates had uncomfortably narrow margins. In some cases the only way the ML could print from the original publisher’s plates was to cut off the running heads, as it did with Anatole France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163). The introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 enhanced the appearance of ML books and made it easier to print from original publishers’ plates.  \n\nOffset lithography is a planographic technology where the printing area of a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed into the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and etching). A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is based on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a lithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink; non-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink. Offset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to be printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a previously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed from metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of letterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed sheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the number of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives are placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The plate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts differently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the printing and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing possible” (Marshall Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2d ed., 1979, p. 132). Letterpress printing typically involves a separate plate for each page; offset plates typically print an entire side of a sheet at a time. Modern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates for each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant printing methodology, some printers appear to have stored the lithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates were stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic printing were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book-printing industry” (p. 136).  \n\nUnlike relief plates, lithographic plates are lightweight and flexible. They are attached to one cylinder of the printing press. The plate is treated so that the printing areas accept greasy printer’s ink and repel water. In the press, the plate is coated with a thin film of water, which prevents ink from adhering to non-printing areas; another roller applies printer’s ink which adheres to the images to be printed.  \n\nLithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or “offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed directly to paper. The inked image is “offset” to a second cylinder covered with a rubber blanket which in turn transfers the image to paper carried by a third cylinder. Lee indicates in *Bookmaking: The Illustrated Guide to Design/Production/Editing* (2nd ed., 1979), “Several advantages are gained by printing on a rubber blanket first instead of directly on paper: (a) the plates last longer, (b) less water comes in contact with the paper, (c) the resilient rubber cylinder permits printing finer copy on rougher paper, and (d) the speed is increased” (p. 137).  \n\nSince letterpress printing transfers ink directly from relief plates or standing type to paper, the type surface is wrong reading so that the printed image will be right reading. The extra step in offset lithography means that lithographic plates are right reading and can be read in the same way that a printed page is read. The inked image on the offset cylinder is wrong reading, and the image transferred to paper is right reading.  \n\nThe ML occasionally resorted to offset lithography before the 1960s when the original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the ML’s format. At that period offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing and the quality was considered to be inferior, but it allowed the ML to avoid the cost of a new typesetting. The ML could photograph the pages of a printed book, reduce the dimensions of the type page photographically, and make offset plates from the negatives.  \n\nThe first ML book printed by offset lithography appears to have been Frank Norris’s *The Pit* (272), published in August 1934. Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular printers, did not have an offset department before 1955, and the ML had the book printed by Polygraphic Printing Co. of America, a New York shop that specialized in offset lithography. Other ML titles printed from offset lithographic plates before the mid-1960s include Newton, *Amenities of Book Collecting* (1935: 287), Malraux, *Man’s Fate* (1936: 294), Whitman, *Leaves of Grass* (1940: G48), Bemelmans, *My War with the United States* (1941: 343), and Thurber, *The Thurber Carnival* (1957: 496). The introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 allowed later printings of *Man’s Fate* to be made from the original publisher’s letterpress plates. *Man’s Fate* was the only ML title printed in succession from offset plates, letterpress plates, and then again from offset plates when the ML switched to offset lithographic printing for most of its titles in the mid 1960s.  \n\nThe cost of printing by offset lithography dropped below that of letterpress printing around 1963. Over the next few years the ML converted most of its books to offset. Today nearly all commercially published books are printed by offset lithography, and letterpress printing is largely confined to small presses that print books in limited editions from handset type.  \n\nSeveral ML books published in the “reissue” format in the 1980s reverted to letterpress printing, presumably to capture price breaks for using idle letterpress equipment after most book publishers had switched to offset lithography. Some of these were printed from letterpress plates that were worn and battered from decades of use; the appearance of these books is distinctly inferior to those printed from offset plates. When the ML switched to offset printing in the mid-1960s, it tried to photograph first ML printings or the earliest printings it could find in order to avoid worn type. Thirteen new titles were added and twelve were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 212. Five new titles were published in ML Giants; by the end of 1934 the Giants included sixteen titles in seventeen volumes. All new titles were published in the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format in balloon cloth binding D with the Kent endpaper in orange. Each title was available in red, blue, green, and brown cloth with the top edge stained the same color as the binding. All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type and torchbearer A2. All new titles had the 3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:  \n\n<center> BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER </center>\n<center> T H E  M O D E R N  L I B R A R Y  </center>\n<center> NEW YORK  </center>\n\nThe title pages of two fall 1934 titles, Veblen, *Theory of the Leisure Class* (274) and Heyward, *Porgy* (275), omitted spaces between the letters in the second line of the imprint:  \n\n<center> BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER </center> \n<center> THE MODERN LIBRARY </center>\n<center> NEW YORK  </center>\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all four bindings. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles, all of which were published in the larger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning fall 1939. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space. All but two 1934 titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets. Veblen, *Theory of the Leisure Class* (274) and Virgil, *Works* (277) were published in individually designed non-pictorial jackets. 95 cents. (Spring) Caldwell, *God’s Little Acre* xHeyward, *Porgy*; Giants through G14; jackets: 225 (=fall 1933, fall 1934). (Fall) Heyward, *Porgy* xHamsun, *Growth of the Soil*; Giants through G17; jackets: 225 (=fall 1933, spring 1934). *Note:* Titles scheduled for January publication were printed late in the preceding year; ML lists inside the jackets and at the end of the volumes are typically those of the preceding fall. Cerf made another attempt to secure James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* for the ML (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 19 March 1934). Six years earlier Macmillan had turned down an advance of \\$4,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy—more than the ML paid for all but a select handful of titles. *The Crock of Gold* was still selling too well in its original American edition for Macmillan to consider a reprint. It never appeared in the ML.  \n\nLittle, Brown turned down an offer by Cerf to reprint *Mutiny on the Bounty* by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Alfred R. McIntyre of Little, Brown indicated that he doubted if anyone would be allowed to publish an inexpensive reprint of the book (Cerf to McIntyre, 20 July 1934; McIntyre to Cerf, 23 July 1934). Cerf was undeterred and made offers for the *Bounty* trilogy.  \n\nCerf was also beginning to think about a book on Judaism. He wrote to Arnold Zweig soliciting his suggestions for the series and indicated, “In particular, I would like to do some history of the Jews in the Modern Library. Have you any suggestions along this line?” (Cerf to Zweig, 24 July 1934). He repeated his interest two years later in a letter to Harold Guinzburg of Viking Press (Cerf to Guinzburg, 3 March 1936). It took twenty years for this goal to be accomplished. Two books on Judaism compiled for Random House, *The Wisdom of Israel*, edited by Lewis Browne (1945) and *Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People*, edited by Leo W. Schwarz (1956) were reprinted in ML Giants in 1956 and 1962.  \n\nDale Warren of Houghton Mifflin Co. suggested a ML edition of Dorothy Richardson’s *Pilgrimage*, the lengthy novel sequence published in the U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf. He noted that “the whole stream of consciousness business was really started by Dorothy Richardson” and added, “I should think you could buy the rights for a song, and get some sale—although you would of course be making one of those superb gestures for which the Cerf-Klopfer twins are justly noted” (Warren to Cerf, 30 January 1934). Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when he was in Boston in September. “My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin have a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are trying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like ourselves” (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934).  \n\nAaron Sussman of Spier & Sussman, the ML’s advertising agency, suggested a complete edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes’s *Breakfast Papers* (Sussman to Cerf, 14 November 1934). Cerf replied, “We steered clear of Holmes and his pals as far as the Modern Library is concerned because we’ve had such rotten luck with Franklin and Longfellow volumes. It makes me believe that people who want this sort of thing are not inclined to look for it in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Sussman, 15 November 1934). Sales of *The Poems of Longfellow* (235) and *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other Writings* (236) improved in the 1940s and 1950s, when Longfellow ranked in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles and Franklin ranked in the second quarter.

Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back copies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and Company, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate Sylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and tourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at customs.

Nonfiction included Emile Burns, *A Handbook of Marxism* and Oswald Jacoby and others, *The Four Aces System of Contract Bridge.* Other books included Dostoyevsky, *The Idiot* with illustrations by Boardman Robinson, which was reprinted in ML Giants in 1942. Ten new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 213. Six new titles were published in the ML Giants, one of which (Symonds, *Renaissance in Italy*) was in two volumes. By the end of 1935 the Giants included twenty-two titles in twenty-four volumes. All new titles except John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (280) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in.

Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown with the top edge stained the same color as the binding. Each title was published in all four bindings. All new titles had Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53) except Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World*, which had plain endpapers on cream paper. ML books that were slightly larger than the standard format had white edges around the endpaper design, but *Ten Days That Shook the World* was so much larger that the patterned endpaper was abandoned altogether. The only other balloon cloth bindings that did not use Kent’s endpaper were three spring 1939 titles which were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space. All new titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets except *An Anthology of Light Verse* (278), which had an individually designed non-pictorial jacket.

The only information available in the RH archives for a suggested title during 1935 is the *Complete Works of Chaucer*. This title was considered for an ML Giant. Estimated at 1200 pages, the length of the work was decided to be prohibitive. “The composition costs will be enormous, running between ten and five thousand dollars” (Commins to Knopf, 7 October 1935).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1936 1936 The most important step in Random House’s growth as a trade publisher came in 1936 when Cerf and Klopfer acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert K. Haas. Smith and Haas had been in business for just over five years, but both men had solid experience in publishing. Smith had been an editor at Harcourt, Brace & Co., where one of his authors was Sinclair Lewis. Shortly before the Wall Street crash he joined the English publisher Jonathan Cape in establishing the firm Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith in New York. He left that firm in October 1931 to go into business with Haas, who had been a founder of the Book-of-the-Month Club and served as its president for five years. Smith and Haas published many important books, but the early 1930s was a difficult time to launch a new publishing firm and Smith and Haas remained financially insecure. When Cerf and Klopfer suggested a merger with Random House they agreed. Haas recalled the circumstances as follows:  \n\n> We had a small, but I think extraordinarily distinguished, list. We did everything but make money. We were not quite in the black, but it was coming; we had been doing better each year. . . . Then one day Bennett Cerf who had been an acquaintance, although not an intimate friend, of mine for some years . . . asked if we would consider merging with them, because they were anxious to get a list of trade books. . . . That appealed to me very much because I thought the Modern Library was the finest list of books of its kind in the whole world (Haas interview, “The Book-of-the-Month Club,” Oral History Research Office, Columbia University, 1954–55, pp. 963–64).  \n\nThe merger gave Random House a ready-made trade list that included such authors as William Faulkner, Isak Dinesen, André Malraux, Robert Graves, Maurice Hindus, Edgar Snow, and Louis Fischer. It also gave Random House a children’s department under the direction of Louise Bonino and a children’s list that included Jean de Brunhoff’s Babar books.  \n\nThe firm’s corporate name changed from The Modern Library, Inc., to Random House, Inc. The Modern Library became a subsidiary of its offspring. Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners of Random House. Cerf was president, Haas was vice-president, Klopfer was treasurer, and Smith was secretary. Cerf described the reorganization in a letter to Gertrude Stein:  \n\n> The actual structure of the new firm leaves one-third of the business belonging to me, one-third to Donald, and the other one-third to be divided between the two new partners. This means, of course, that in a pinch we will always be running the show. As a matter of fact, however, both of the new partners are not only very charming men, but are extremely competent and highly regarded by the publishing world. I am absolutely sure that everything will work out beautifully (Cerf to Stein, 28 February 1936, Random House Collection).  \n\nThe transition is documented in the title leaves of ML books published between January and May 1936. January and February titles include Cerf and Klopfer’s names on the title page as part of the imprint; beginning in March Cerf and Klopfer’s names are omitted from the imprint. Original ML introductions are copyrighted under the name The Modern Library, Inc., through April. Beginning in May 1936 Random House, Inc., becomes the copyright holder, and the names of all four owners are recorded on the verso of the title page (see examples under “Title Page” below).  \n\nSmith remained at Random House for less than a year. The firm did not need a fourth partner, and Smith had a flair for forgetting dates and losing manuscripts that Cerf found irritating (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 123). He once described Smith as “the only man who ever mislaid six manuscripts simultaneously in the same desk” (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 18 April 1942, p. 20). When Smith resigned as of 1 January 1937 he commented, “I have discovered that the combined staff of both houses was so completely and fully manned on the editorial side that it did not leave enough active work for me in the future” (Harrison Smith to Fletcher Pratt, 30 December 1936, Random House Collection). He later became the publisher of *Saturday Review of Literature*.  \n\nAfter Smith’s departure Cerf, Klopfer and Haas each owned one-third of Random House and the Modern Library. Haas, who was eight years older than Cerf and twelve years older than Klopfer, remained an active partner until his retirement in 1956.  \n\nThe acquisition of Smith and Haas was the second of three events in the 1930s that were of major importance in the development of Random House as a trade publisher. The first was the acquisition of Eugene O’Neill and the hiring of Saxe Commins as editor in 1933 after the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The third was the arrival of Lewis Miller in August 1936.  \n\nMiller came to Random House from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary, where he had been sales manager and played an important role in the success of the firm’s full-sized reprints, Star Dollar Books. He moved to Random House to develop a reprint line under the resurrected Carlton House imprint, but that venture was unsuccessful and in January 1938 he became sales manager for Random House and the Modern Library. He was one of the best sales managers in the business and it was in that capacity that he played a major role in the development of Random House. He remained with the firm until his retirement in 1967. Klopfer once stated that Miller was “responsible for Random House being as big a firm as it was” (Klopfer, interview with GBN, 1 June 1977). Ten new titles were added and ten titles were discontinued. The number of titles in the regular ML remained stable at 213, making 1936 the first year in which the number of titles in the regular series did not increase. Six new titles were published in ML Giants series, bringing the Giants to twenty-eight titles in thirty volumes. All new titles except Glasgow, *Barren Ground* (289) and James, *Portrait of a Lady* (291) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Barren Ground* was ¼ inch taller and wider to accommodate the Doubleday, Doran plates; *Portrait of a Lady* was ¼ inch taller to accommodate the Houghton, Mifflin plates. All new titles were published in balloon cloth binding D with the Kent endpaper in orange. Each title was available in red, blue, green, and brown cloth with the top edge stained the same color as the binding.  \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; six title pages had torchbearer A2 and four had torchbearer A3. The title pages of the January and February titles—Dostoyevsky, *The Possessed* (288) and Glasgow, *Barren Ground* (289)—have the 3-line imprint that had been used since January 1931:  \n\n<center> BENNETT A.

Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles, all of which were published in the larger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning fall 1939. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space. All but three 1936 titles except were published in individually designed pictorial jackets. Dostoyevsky, *The Possessed* (288), James, *Portrait of a Lady* (291), and James, *Varieties of Religious Experience* (296) were published in individually designed non-pictorial jackets. The front flap of each jacket included descriptive text about the work written by Saxe Commins. 95 cents. (Spring) Gogol, *Dead Souls* xMalraux, *Man’s Fate*; Giants through G27; jackets: 242. (Fall) Malraux, *Man’s Fate* xGraves, *I, Claudius*; Giants through G30; jackets: 245. *Note:* Titles scheduled for January publication were printed late in the preceding year; ML lists inside the jackets and at the end of the volumes are typically those of the preceding fall. Two years after Little, Brown rejected his earlier offer to include *Mutiny on the Bounty* in the ML, Cerf tried again to secure reprint rights to the novel. By this time the second and third volumes of Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall’s Bounty trilogy—*Men Against the Sea* and *Pitcairn’s Island—*had been published, and the motion picture version of *Mutiny on the Bounty* starring Charles Laughton and Clark Gable had been released. Cerf offered a \\$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML edition to be published in spring 1937. He wrote, “We have discovered that by putting the first volumes of the Proust set in the Modern Library, we have boosted the sale of the complete set enormously, and I honestly believe that by making *Mutiny on the Bounty* available to a new audience, you would find the sales of the trilogy increased in exactly the same manner” (Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 5 October 1936). Little, Brown was not persuaded.  \n\nAnother popular book for which the ML was unable to get reprint rights was Ralph Roeder’s *Man of the Renaissance*, which had been published by Viking Press in 1933 (Haas to Marshall Best, Viking Press, 14 September 1936).  \n\nAlfred McIntyre of Little, Brown suggested a ML edition of Louis-Ferdinand Céline’s *Journey to the End of Night* (McIntyre to Cerf, 10 February 1936), but the Little, Brown edition was nearly two inches taller than the ML’s format and the original plates could not have been used. Cerf responded, “Under ordinary circumstances, I would be strongly inclined to add the book to the regular Modern Library series because I think it is good enough for it, but the plate difficulty seems insurmountable” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 March 1936). It would have been possible to photograph the Little, Brown edition, reduce the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography—as New Directions did for at least some paperback printings of *Journey to the End of Night* three or four decades later—but in the 1930s offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing, the quality was not as good, and the ML resorted to it reluctantly. Céline’s novel never appeared in the ML.  \n\nRoss G. Baker of Bobbs-Merrill suggested Robert Nathan’s *Woodcutter’s House*, which the firm had published in 1927. Cerf replied, “We discussed this book several times before . . . and decided that it is not sufficiently popular to warrant its inclusion in the series, despite its obvious merit. It is true that Knopf is doing a great deal of ballyhoo for Nathan these days, but unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be doing very much for his older titles” (Cerf to Baker, 4 August 1936).  \n\nRaymond Healy, who had been hired in 1935 as the ML’s sales representative on the West Coast, suggested that the ML publish a cookbook. Cerf replied, “We <u>have</u> thought of putting a cookbook in the Modern Library, but decided that we had better stick more to the literary line . . . and let people like Blue Ribbon and Star Dollar do cookbooks and the like” (Cerf to Healy, 3 April 1936; underlining in original). Around the same time Healy reported that “the trade is now asking us for an Emerson in the Modern Library. Personally, I think the old Gent was a stick in the mud but I relay the request to you anyhow” (Healy to Cerf, 6 April 1936). The ML published Emerson’s *Complete Essays and Other Writings* (334) in 1940.

Houghton Mifflin declined an offer to add *The Rise of Silas Lapham* by William Dean Howells (Cerf to Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 18 October 1937; Linscott to Klopfer, 4 January 1938). The ML was able to publish *Selected Poetry of Emily Dickinson* (410) in 1948 and *The Rise of Silas Lapham* (442) in 1951.   \n\nCerf decided not to publish a ML edition of Thomas Wolfe’s *Of Time and the River* (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 21 October 1937).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1938 1938 The spring 1938 RH catalogue was indicative of the growing importance of RH’s trade list. It included Isak Dineson’s *Out of Africa*, William Faulkner’s *Unvanquished*, Robert Graves’s *Count Belisarius*, Edgar Snow’s *Red Star Over China*, and John Strachey’s *What is to be Done?* Other titles included *The Public Papers* and *Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt* in five volumes and *The Complete Greek Drama*, a two-volume set in the Lifetime Library, a series of mainly ancient classics that began the previous year with *The Complete Dialogues of Plato*.   \n\nIt was a list that even other publishers found impressive. Albert Knopf wrote to Cerf: “I have just been looking over with admiration and respect your new catalogue. You are publishing a lot of interesting books and building on a solid foundation” (Knopf to Cerf, 26 January 1938). Philip Van Doren Stern of Simon & Schuster was equally impressed, and perhaps a bit envious (Stern to Cerf, 26 January 1938).   \n\n> I want to congratulate you on your really magnificent list. It is one of the finest that I have ever seen assembled by an American publisher. You will certainly have a successful year with books like these and you are building up a backlist that will give your house a solid foundation of real honest-to-God titles in the years to come. . . . \n> P.S. This is no Dale Carnegie crap [*How to Win Friends and Influence People*, then enjoying a huge success, was a Simon & Schuster publication.] I mean every word of it. Eight new titles were added and five were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 219. Five new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1938 ML Giants included forty titles in forty-two volumes. All new titles in the regular ML except Walter D. Edmonds, *Rome Haul* (310) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Rome Haul* was ¼ in. taller and wider to accommodate the Little, Brown plates.   \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in fall 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.   \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles in the regular ML had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; four had torchbearer A2 and four had torchbearer A3. All new titles had the 2-line imprint:   \n\n<center> T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y  </center> \n<center> NEW YORK  </center> Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with the top edge stained the same color as the binding. Each title was published simultaneously in all four bindings. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning in fall 1939. These four titles had blank endpapers. Since endpapers were printed from plates designed for the standard balloon cloth format, titles like Edmonds, *Rome Haul*, which were slightly larger than the standard balloon cloth format had endpapers with unprinted outer edges. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding pattern of open books and the initials “ml” was extended to fill the larger space. All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Four had pictorial jackets; Steinbeck, *Of Mice and Men* and *The Wisdom of Confucius* had non-pictorial jackets. Two titles had predominately non-pictorial jackets: the blue background of Canfield, *The Deepening Stream*, was patterned to suggest water currents, and Proust, *Cities of the Plain*, featured a small left-profile silhouette of the author. 95 cents. (Spring) Confucius, *Wisdom* xProust, *Cities of the Plain*; Giants through G40; jackets: 257. (Fall) Proust, *Cities of the Plain* xStone, *Lust for Life*; Giants through G42; jackets: 262. Cerf wanted to add a historical novel to the ML. He wrote Doubleday, Doran about Kenneth Roberts’s *Arundel*, which dealt with Benedict Arnold’s expedition to Quebec during the Revolutionary War. He noted that he understood that Roberts was not keen about having his books in reprint editions but argued that the ML should “be considered in a rather different category than the ordinary reprint. We have got one book or more by almost every important American novelist in the series now” (Cerf to Malcolm Johnson, Doubleday, Doran, 12 May 1938). Cerf then wrote to Roberts himself, offering an advance of \\$1,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated, “In these days and times, a \\$1500.00 advance is a heavy one, but I feel so confident that ARUNDEL would sell like blazes in the Modern Library series that I think the advance would be earned in far less than the usual time and that, therefore, the book would sell in the Modern Library series very steadily for many years to come” (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 May 1938). Doubleday, Doran agreed to Cerf’s terms, but Roberts was unconvinced. He indicated that he was not certain that *Arundel* should be available in a cheap edition, and subsequently wrote that he had decided “to wait a while longer before allowing a cheap edition of any of my books” (Roberts to Cerf, 21 November 1938).   \n\nShortly thereafter Cerf wrote Hervey Allen about including his historical novel *Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants (Cerf to Hervey Allen, 6 December 1938). He first expressed interest in *Anthony Adverse* five years earlier, shortly after it was published (see 1933 Titles sought, suggested, declined). *Anthony Adverse* sold 300,000 copies in its first six months and led the fiction bestseller lists in 1933 and 1934. Nothing came of Cerf’s initiative. Like Roberts’s *Arundel*, *Anthony Adverse* does not appear to have been published in an inexpensive reprint edition.   \n\nCerf approached Little, Brown yet again about a ML edition of Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall’s *Bounty* trilogy, but Alfred McIntyre of Little, Brown indicated that the books were still selling too well in their original editions to consider an inexpensive reprint (Cerf to McIntyre, 19 April 1938; McIntyre to Cerf, 20 April 1938). That fall Cerf wrote again:   \n\n>What we want at the moment is a real leader or two for our Modern Library list for the next year. We can get all the sound run-of-the-mill titles, but it is a different problem to find another item like our Freud or Jean Christophe to head next year’s list. This brings me around once again to the question of the Bounty trilogy. If we were to offer you \\$5000.00 cash on signing of the contract for an edition of 50,000 copies of the trilogy, to be published in the Spring of 1939 as a Modern Library Giant at \\$1.25, would you be inclined to consider the proposal? The understanding would be that after 50,000 copies had been exhausted, we could not print another edition in this format without a brand new contract with you. Frankly, I think this would be a wonderful title for the Modern Library and that it would establish the authors on a higher literary plane than they have ever occupied before (Cerf to McIntyre, 7 September, 1938).   \n\nThe advance was twice what Cerf had offered in 1936, though the royalty rate remained the same (see 1936 Titles sought, suggested, declined). McIntyre replied that Little, Brown was publishing its own one-volume edition in October for the Christmas season and that it would be withdrawn in January, after which Little, Brown would push the three separate volumes (McIntyre to Cerf, 8 September 1938).   \n\nIn 1940 Cerf tried again to secure the *Bounty* trilogy for the ML. On that occasion he was told that Little, Brown was publishing a new edition of the trilogy with illustrations by N. C. Wyeth (Cerf to McIntyre, 2 April 1940; McIntyre to Cerf, 6 April 1940). The edition with Wyeth’s illustrations was published in October 1940.   \n\nDuring a trip to England in fall 1938 Cerf met with George Bernard Shaw, who had always opposed inexpensive reprint editions of his plays. On this occasion Cerf reported in a letter to Random House, “Old boy spryer than ever. All for us doing ‘9 Plays’ as Giant. Gotta get after Dodd, Mead on this soon” (Cerf Papers Box 71, Cerf European trip (1) folder. Cerf to Random House, undated). *Nine Plays* included *Mrs. Warren’s Profession*, *Arms and the Man*, *Candida*, *The Devil’s Disciple*, *Caesar and Cleopatra*, *Man and Superman*, *Fanny’s First Play*, *Androcles and the Lion*, and *Saint Joan*. However, when Cerf contacted Dodd, Mead after his return, he indicated that the two firms would have to find a formula satisfactory to both, given the number of editions of Shaw’s works that Dodd, Mead published. Since Dodd, Mead had no cheap edition of *St. Joan*, he suggested a ML edition of that play with “one or 2 lesser efforts. Perhaps Candida or Caesar & Cleopatra” (Cerf to Howard Lewis, Dodd, Mead & Co., 2 December 1938). There is no further correspondence in the archives about a ML reprint of Shaw’s plays. Shaw may have changed his mind, or Dodd, Mead may have vetoed the idea. It was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to publish two volumes of his plays: *Four Plays* (1953) and *Saint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956).   \n\nHenry Hoyns of Harper and Brothers suggested a ML edition of Paul Horgan’s novel *The Fault of Angels*, which had won the Harper Prize when it was published in 1933. Cerf replied that he did not think there would be sufficient sales to justify a ML edition (Hoyns to Cerf, 4 February 1938; Cerf to Hoyns, 17 February 1938).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1939 1939 The ML underwent a major change in format and design for the second time in its history. The first, in 1929, substituted balloon cloth bindings for imitation leather and introduced Rockwell Kent’s binding and endpaper designs. (Balloon cloth began to be used in January 1929; Kent’s binding and endpaper designs were introduced in April.) The balloon cloth format suffered from two problems. The semi-flexible balloon cloth bindings were attractive but did not stand up to heavy use. And the 6½ x 4¼ inch (165 x 107 mm) page size, retained from Boni & Liveright days, sometimes made it difficult to print from original publishers’ letterpress plates, most of which were designed for a larger format. Many of the volumes printed from original publishers’ plates had uncomfortably narrow margins. Sometimes the original plates were too large to be used by the ML.  \n\nThe ML’s economic model assumed multiple printings, and all ML books were printed from plates. For older titles in the public domain the ML usually ordered new typesettings from which new plates were made. Copyrighted works were printed whenever possible from the original publisher’s plates. In general, the ML expected to pay royalties or typesetting and plate-making costs but tried whenever possible to avoid paying both. Royalties paid by the ML to the original publisher were regarded in part as a plate rental. In this respect the ML operated no differently than Grosset & Dunlap and other publishers of hardbound reprints of current books. Grosset & Dunlap differed from the ML in that its printings were closer in size to the original publishers’ editions, and it rarely had problems using original publishers’ plates.  \n\nThe ML had several options when the original publisher’s plates were too large for its format. The most expensive option was to reset the work to fit its format and make new letterpress plates. When the ML did this for copyrighted titles the original publisher occasionally agreed to forego royalties in whole or part until the plates were paid for. A second option was to photograph a clean copy of the original publisher’s edition, reduce the size of the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography. The disadvantage of this approach was that before the 1960s offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing and the quality was inferior. Another option when the original publisher’s plates were only slightly too large for the ML’s format was to print from a duplicate set of plates with the headline removed. Finally, the ML could print a given title in a slightly larger format in order to accommodate the original publisher’s plates. The ML resorted to this option on several occasions during the balloon cloth era, and once—for Charles Jackson’s *The* *Lost Weekend* (406), a short-lived title published in 1948—after the introduction of its larger format in fall 1939.  \n\nAnother problem with the balloon cloth format was that it made it harder to sell ML books to libraries. Many libraries did not buy ML books before the 1940s because the bindings did not stand up to heavy use and the narrow margins made rebinding difficult.  \n\nA new format that corrected both faults was introduced in September 1939 with *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) and John Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* (322). The page size was increased half an inch to 7 x 4¾ inches (176 x 120 mm). And the balloon cloth binding was replaced with a far more durable binding constructed of stiff boards covered with smooth linen. The new binding, designed by Joseph Blumenthal, is described below. Two spring 1939 titles, Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317) and Isak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales* (320), were published in the larger format with balloon cloth bindings.  \n\nThe introduction of the larger format for regular ML volumes meant that existing jackets had to be replaced or redesigned. A few titles received enlarged versions of their existing jackets, but most were outfitted in newly designed jackets. Two designers were responsible for most of the new jackets that were introduced at this period. Joseph Blumenthal created a large number of elegant typographic jackets. The majority of new pictorial jackets were by Paul Galdone, a Hungarian-born illustrator of children’s books who designed his first ML jackets in 1937. Many ML Giants also received new jackets to go with their new bindings, although the size of the Giants remained unchanged.  \n\nThe introduction of the new format involved reprinting backlist titles at an accelerated pace so the series could regain a uniform appearance as quickly as possible. It also presented the ML with the problem of disposing of balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse. When the first two titles in new format were published in September 1939, over 200 regular ML titles remained in the balloon cloth format. It would be February 1941 before the ML could announce, “Every title in the MODERN LIBRARY (95¢) is now ready *in the new binding!*” (*PW* 139, 15 February 1941, pp. 814–15).  \n\nAn arrangement with the Book-of-the-Month Club, which appears to have begun in fall 1938, may have been conceived in part as a way of reducing the inventory of balloon cloth titles. The Book-of-the-Month Club offered free Modern Library books, all in balloon cloth bindings and 1930s jackets, to members who made advance deposits of \\$12 or more against future purchases. Two 16-page brochures titled “Free Books” are known to exist. The first is undated, gives the Book-of-the-Month Club’s address as 386 Fourth Avenue, New York, and includes Fitzgerald’s *The Great* *Gatsby*—now one of the most sought-after ML titles (*MLC* 46, p. 1). The second catalog, dated 3-39 (March 1939), uses the Club’s new address, 385 Madison Avenue. The March 1939 catalog can be viewed online at <http://www.modernlib.com/General/brochures/BOMC/BOMC39.html> (accessed 24 August 2017). It lists 103 titles from the regular ML and 42 Giants—half of the titles then in the series—along with books from five other reprint series. *The Great Gatsby*, which had been discontinued at the end of 1938, is not included in the second catalog, although a large number of unsold copies remained in the ML warehouse. Any hint that the offer was essentially a remaindering operation was avoided. Book-of-the-Month Club members were also given the option of buying ML books at the regular price. The arrangement with the Book-of-the-Month Club suggests that the ML planned the transition to the new format well in advance.  \n\nMost of the 110,000 balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse in early 1941 were disposed of at a widely publicized sale at Macy’s, the New York department store. Macy’s was one of the leading retailers of ML books, and it made a cash offer for the remaining stock of balloon cloth bindings. The sale was announced in a full-page ad in the Sunday *New York Times* (2 February 1941, p. 27). The ad listed 166 titles that were available in quantities of 100 copies or more. Another 50 balloon cloth titles were available in smaller quantities. The sale price for books in the discontinued binding was 33 cents. Three books were 94 cents; the price for twenty was \\$5.98. The sale began Monday morning at 9:30, and the books sold out in less than a week.  \n\nOnce the transition to the new format was complete, the ML invited booksellers to return their remaining stock of balloon cloth titles for replacement with volumes in the new format. Booksellers had a one-month window during which balloon cloth volumes could be exchanged. By February 1941, 700 accounts had returned around 160,000 books and received an equal number of volumes in the Blumenthal format at no cost. Two months later Cerf indicated that returns of balloon cloth volumes were expected to run to more than 200,000 copies. At that time the ML had not decided what would be done with the returned books, but the U.S. Government was expected to buy thousands of them for libraries in cantonments where new troops were billeted (*PW* 139, 8 February 1941, p. 741; 15 February 1941, pp. 814–15; 5 April 1941, p. 1459).  \n\nThe year that saw the introduction of the ML’s new format was also the year that the twentieth-century paperback revolution spread to the United States. The paperback revolution in the English-speaking world was launched by Allan Lane, who founded Penguin Books in 1935. Pocket Books, Inc., established in 1939, was the first American publisher of mass-market paperbacks. It operated very differently from the ML. The 6½ x 4⅛ inch (164 x 105 mm) format of mass-market paperbacks was smaller than the ML’s original format. Pocket Books ordered new typesettings for all of its titles, printed its books on high-speed magazine presses in print runs vastly larger than the ML’s, and priced the books at 25 cents. Magazine wholesalers, who distributed the books to mass-market outlets such as drug stores and newsstands, treated paperback books as they did magazines. Newly published titles were distributed monthly. Credit for unsold copies of the previous month’s books was secured by tearing off the front covers and returning the covers. The coverless books were then pulped. Eight new titles were added to the Modern Library and nine were discontinued, reducing the number of titles in the regular series to 218. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1939 ML Giants included forty-six titles in forty-eight volumes. Two spring titles (Liddell Hart, *The War in Outline* and Walton, *The Compleat Angler*) were published in the ML’s standard balloon cloth format with binding D measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). The other two spring titles (Stone, *Lust for Life* and Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*) were in a larger format with balloon cloth bindings measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm).  \n\nFall titles were published in a newly designed binding with stiff boards measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). The larger format remained standard for nearly all titles published in the regular ML from fall 1939 through 1968. In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles in the regular ML had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; three had torchbearer C2 and five had torchbearer A2. All new titles had the 2-line imprint:  \n\n<center> T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y  </center>\n<center> NEW YORK  </center>\n\nAdler’s title-page design was used for the last time in fall 1939. Beginning in 1940 Modern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal. The balloon cloth binding was used for the last time in spring 1939. A new binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the Spiral Press, was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. Blumenthal’s binding was designed for the ML’s new 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format and used smooth linen over stiff boards. The new bindings were in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover over upon which lettering stamped in gold. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Unlike balloon cloth bindings, where a portion of each printing of a given title was bound in cloth of different colors, each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. Successive printings sometimes had bindings in different color combinations. As Blumenthal recalled it, Cerf and Klopfer accepted the design on the first sketch he submitted (Blumenthal to GBN, 30 June 1978).  \n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the inset panel on the spine. There were two versions of the inset panel on the front cover, both of which employed a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel. The first version of the outer frame, used on the two titles published in September 1939 and all titles published 1940–1962, featured Kent’s torchbearer in gold below the inset panel at the lower right.  \n\nBlumenthal appears to have been dissatisfied with the front panel design, and the two October 1939 titles, Fielding, *Joseph Andrews* (323) and Fineman, *Hear, Ye Sons* (324), feature an alternative version. The panel with the title and author is unchanged, but Kent’s torchbearer was omitted, and the outer frame in gold is adjusted so that the top is the same distance (10 mm) from the inner panel as the sides, and the bottom is 12 mm from the inner panel. The omission of the torchbearer gave the front panel of the binding a more classic, uncluttered appearance—but there was nothing on the front panel to identify the series or associate the volume with the ML. All previous ML bindings had included a ML device on the front panel. It is not known whether Blumenthal or Cerf and Klopfer made the decision to revert to Blumenthal’s original front panel design. All subsequent ML books except the first three Giants and titles in the short-lived Illustrated Modern Library series have included a ML device on the front panel of the binding. Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in moderate orange was used for one 1939 title, the first printing of Walton, *Complete Angler* (319). The only other 1939 title in the 6⅝ x 4⅜ inch format for which the endpaper had been designed was Liddell Hart, *War in Outline* (318), which used a map from the original edition as the front and back endpaper. The other two spring 1939 titles, Stone, *Lust for Life* and Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*, were published in the larger 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would be adopted for all ML titles in fall 1939. The first printings of *Lust for Life* and *Seven Gothic Tales* had plain cream endpapers, as did the four titles published in fall 1939. The only previous ML volume in the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, John Reed’s *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935), also had plain cream endpapers. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Four titles (Stone, *Lust for Life*; Liddell Hart, *War in Outline*; Walton, *Compleat Angler*; and Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle*) had pictorial jackets, and four (Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*; Odets, *Six Plays*; Fielding, *Joseph Andrews*; and Fineman, *Hear, Ye Sons*) had non-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Joseph Andrews* and *Hear, Ye Sons* may have been designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many older titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed. 95 cents. (Spring) Stone, *Lust for Life* xOdets, *Six Plays*; Giants through G45; jackets: 265. (Fall) Odets, *Six Plays* xChaucer, *Troilus and Cressida*; Giants through G48; jackets: 268. Cerf asked Knopf for permission to publish Thomas Mann’s *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant, adding “we would be willing to make a special royalty deal on this one book, and would pay a whopping advance for it immediately” (Cerf to Knopf, 7 February 1939). Mann’s novel had appeared in the regular ML in 1932, but Knopf declined to renew the five-year reprint contract and the ML edition had been out of print since May 1938. Knopf rejected Cerf’s offer. Several subsequent reprint offers by the ML were also unsuccessful. *The Magic Mountain* was not restored to the regular ML until 1992, after Random House’s “relaunch” of the series. By this time Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., had been a division of Random House for 32 years.  \n\nCerf inquired about the possibility of doing a volume by Edna St. Vincent Millay in the ML (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939). Macmillan rejected an offer for the one-volume edition of Sir James George Frazier’s *The Golden Bough*, originally published in 1922, noting that it still netted the firm between \\$1,300 and \\$1,800 a year (George P. Brett, Macmillan, to Cerf, 7 August 1939). Cerf expressed interest in reprinting John Galsworthy’s *The Forsyte Saga* (published in one volume by Scribner’s in 1925) as a Giant, offering an advance of \\$7,500 (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939), but Scribner’s had no interest in authorizing a reprint edition.  \n\nCerf also expressed interest in including A. L. Morton, *A People’s History of England* in ML Giants (Cerf to Morton, 9 November 1939), but the book never appeared in the series. The American edition had been published by Random House the previous year. The original edition was published in Britain by Victor Gollancz and had been the May 1938 main selection of Gollancz’s Left Book Club.  \n\nClifford Odets suggested a collection of the best eight, ten, or twelve American plays ever written (Odets to Cerf, 20 September 1939). Howard Mumford Jones suggested a volume by Anthony Trollope (Jones to Cerf, 8 June 1938), but the ML had published *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (292) three years earlier. It would be eight years before Trollope’s *Eustace Diamonds* (399) was added. John Farrar suggested Henry Seidel Canby’s *Age of Confidence*, which Farrar & Rinehart had published five years earlier.  \n\nCerf considered adding Gustavus Myers’s *History of the Supreme Court of the United States* but decided that it did not quite fit into the Modern Library list (Cerf to Kerr & Co., 7 November 1939).  \n\nGertrude Stein urged Cerf to add her two autobiographical works, *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* (Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1933) and *Everybody’s Autobiography* (Random House, 1937) to the ML (Stein to Cerf, undated). Cerf replied that he would love to see them as a Giant but that “public demand for these books is practically non-existent” (Cerf to Stein, 8 August 1939). Stein’s *Three Lives* (261) had been published in the ML in 1933, but sales were disappointing and it was discontinued at the end of 1940. It would be twenty-four years before another book by Stein appeared in the regular ML. *The Selected Writings of Gertrude Stein* (547) was published in 1963, followed by *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* (623) in 1980. However, *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* was reprinted in Random House’s quality paperback series, Modern Library Paperbacks, in fall 1955. After Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, the Knopf series Vintage Books became the quality paperback imprint for the combined firm, and later paperback printings of *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* appeared in Vintage Books.

The first, in 1929, substituted balloon cloth bindings for imitation leather and introduced Rockwell Kent’s binding and endpaper designs. (Balloon cloth began to be used in January 1929; Kent’s binding and endpaper designs were introduced in April.) The balloon cloth format suffered from two problems. The semi-flexible balloon cloth bindings were attractive but did not stand up to heavy use. And the 6½ x 4¼ inch (165 x 107 mm) page size, retained from Boni & Liveright days, sometimes made it difficult to print from original publishers’ letterpress plates, most of which were designed for a larger format. Many of the volumes printed from original publishers’ plates had uncomfortably narrow margins. Sometimes the original plates were too large to be used by the ML. [object Object]",

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1940 1940 By 1940, Cerf and Klopfer had been in charge of the ML for nearly fifteen years. Many titles inherited from Boni & Liveright were discontinued in the 1930s; by 1940, less than a third of the Boni & Liveright titles remained. ML Giants joined the regular ML series in 1931. By spring 1940, regular titles and Giants together numbered 270 titles—two-and-a-half times the size of the series when Cerf and Klopfer acquired it.  \n\nThe increased representation of American authors in the ML that began in the 1930s continued. By 1940, 28 percent of the authors in the regular series were Americans, compared to 20 percent in 1930. Even so, British authors remained in first place, accounting for 36 percent of the regular series. There was a marked falling off of French authors from 18 percent in 1930 to 11 percent in 1940. This decline reflected the large number of French titles—most of which were inherited from Boni & Liveright days—that were dropped during the 1930s.  \n\nBy 1940, the regular ML was a series of predominately modern works. In 1940, 22 percent of the titles were works dating from the preceding 20 years. In spring 1940, works first published between 1881 and 1900 made up just 15 percent of the regular ML series, compared with 34 percent in 1930 and 26 percent in 1925.  \n\nThe tendency toward making the ML more middlebrow was reflected in an increased proportion of fiction. By spring 1940, fiction accounted for 64 percent of the regular ML. That was the highest proportion of fiction the ML would ever contain. Eleven new titles were added to the ML and nine were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular series to 219. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1940 ML Giants included fifty-two titles in fifty-four volumes. Beginning in 1940, ML title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. Existing titles acquired new title pages as they were reprinted. Blumenthal created the new title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s new format (7¼ x 4⅞ inches, enlarged from 6⅝ x 4⅜ inches) was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards and were sturdier than the ML’s earlier bindings. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination.  \n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold on all titles published 1940–1962. An enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s larger format, was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged; the surrounding pattern of open books and “ml” initials was extended to fill the larger space. The spring endpapers, like earlier Kent endpapers, were in moderate orange; fall 1940 endpapers were in gray. Kent endpapers in gray remained in use through spring 1966. New titles published in fall 1966 and spring 1967 had Kent endpapers in light yellowish brown. New endpapers designed by S. Neil Fujita were introduced in fall 1967 as part of a comprehensive redesign of the series. All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Five titles (Sheean, *Personal History*; Marquand, *The Late George Apley*; Forester, *The African Queen*; Porter, *Flowering Judas and Other Stories*; and Emerson, *The Complete Essays and Other Writings*) had pictorial jackets. Six (Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida*; Machiavelli, *The Prince and The Discourses*; Lewisohn, *The Island Within*; Forster, *A Passage to India*; *The Short Bible*; and Morley, *Human Being*) had non-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Troilus and Cressida*, Machiavelli, Lewisohn, and Forster were clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many for older titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed. 95 cents. (Spring) Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida* xEmerson, *Complete Essays*; Giants through G51; jackets: 271 (=spring 1941). (Fall) Emerson, *Complete Essays* xHugo, *Hunchback of Notre Dame*; Giants through G54; jackets: 274. Cerf expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940), but it would be 1946 before *The Poems of Robert Frost* (393) appeared in the ML. Cerf tried again to get Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* for the ML, offering an advance of \\$2,000 against 10 cents a copy royalties for reprint rights (Cerf to Van Cartmell, Doubleday, Doran, 27 February 1940). It would be another decade before the ML secured reprint rights to Kipling’s novel. Cerf also sought Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings’s *The Yearling*, which was published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1938, became the year’s best-selling novel, and won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. He indicated that he wanted to publish it in 1942 (Cerf to Max Perkins, 11 April 1940). Scribner’s did not grant reprint rights to the ML until 1946. The ML edition of *The Yearling* (391) appeared late in 1946.  \n\nSeveral other titles to which Cerf tried to secure reprint rights never appeared in the series. He offered advances of \\$1,000 against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *The Collected Poems of T. S. Eliot* and Lytton Strachey’s *Queen Victoria* (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 26 April 1940; Cerf to Donald Brace, 3 May 1940). He had been trying to get *Queen Victoria* for the ML since 1928. He also wanted to publish William Graham Sumner’s *Folkways* as an ML Giant. He offered Ginn & Co., who first published it in 1906, a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. “Judging by our sales of similar volumes of the series,” he wrote, “I think it fair to assume that we will sell these 10,000 copies within a year and a half, and that thereafter the book should sell between 2000 and 4000 copies every year. . . .” (Cerf to Richard Thornton, Ginn & Co., 16 August 1940). Thornton declined the offer: “We still have a fair sale for the book, and we have recently put out a special Centennial Edition [Sumner was born in 1840], which we have been giving extra promotion” (Thornton to Cerf, 25 September 1940).  \n\nCerf received a suggestion for Alfred Thayer Mahan’s *Influence of Sea Power upon History*, but after seeing a copy he concluded it was “too special in its appeal—and dated, too—to be a likely candidate for ML” (Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 April 1940).

The next four years would be difficult, as publishers struggled with a huge increase in demand for books coupled with scarcity of resources, including paper rationing, the absence of personnel who served in the armed services, and other dislocations caused by the war. The end of the war in August 1945 was accompanied by rapid inflation and a wave of strikes that disrupted the return to a peacetime economy. It would be September 1948 before the Modern Library could announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now back in stock for the first time since the war” (Modern Library advertisement, *Publishers’ Weekly*, September 17, 1948, p. 1095). Ten titles were added to the ML and ten were discontinued. The number of titles in the series remained at 219, the same as in 1940. Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer.

The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through spring 1966. Two 1941 titles (Saroyan, *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* and Bemelmans, *My War with the United States*) were originally published by Random House; their ML jackets were adapted from the RH jackets. The Saroyan jacket was designed by Ernest Reichl, and the jacket for *My War with the United States* featured an adaptation of one of Bemelmans’s illustrations. \n\nThe jacket for Steinbeck, *The Grapes of Wrath* incorporated a reproduction of Thomas Hart Benton’s lithograph “Departure of the Joads” from his Grapes of Wrath series. Paul Galdone was responsible for three jackets: Hugo, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was an individually designed pictorial jacket; *Five Great Modern Irish Plays* and Lardner, *Collected Stories* featured a decorative non-pictorial design that was used on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s. \n\nPascal, *Pensées & The Provincial Letters*, had a typographic jacket that was clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal. Three other predominately typographic jackets were probably also by Blumenthal, who signed none of his jackets. *The Federalist* featured a decorative image of an American eagle, Proust’s *The Captive* had a small silhouette of Proust in left profile that was also used on the other six titles of *Remembrance of Things Past*, and Plato’s *Republic* had an inset photographic image of a bust of Plato. 95 cents.

Cerf expressed interest in Ernest Hemingway’s *For Whom the Bell Tolls*, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1940: “This is one book above almost any other that has been written in the past five years that I’d like to see on the Modern Library list when the time comes” (Cerf to Max Perkins, 23 July 1941). The ML never secured reprint rights. In 1953 Scribner’s served notice that it was withdrawing all three Hemingway titles in the ML—*The Sun Also Rises* (190), *A Farewell to Arms* (237), and *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* (G59)—in order to publish their own reprint editions in all English-speaking markets in North America. \n\nConrad Aiken repeated his suggestion for a ML edition of his first novel, *Blue Voyage*, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1927 (Aiken to Cerf, 19 May 1941). Aiken edited several poetry anthologies for the ML, but he never had a book of his own in the series.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1942 1942 The war brought many changes to Random House. Klopfer, who was thirty-nine, applied for a commission in the Air Force. He was commissioned as a captain in May 1942 and left for training in California at the end of the month. He was away from Random House until after the war. The war years were good ones for him. He was posted to England with the Eighth Air Force in October 1943 and served as an intelligence officer for a heavy bomber squadron—the job he wanted. When he stopped by Random House to say his final goodbyes before leaving for London, Cerf thought he looked “happier and more excited than I have ever seen him in my life before” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library). Early the following year he was promoted to major (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 12 February 1944, p. 19).\n\nCerf was four years older than Klopfer and too old for military service. He remained a civilian, looking after Random House and playing an active role in the Council on Books in Wartime, of which he was a director. “I get damned impatient plugging away at publishing,” he told a friend in the service in 1943, “while all of you fellows are out there doing things I’d like to be doing myself, but I may as well face the fact that I am 45, that I am nearsighted as a bat, and that somebody has to keep Random House rolling along” (Cerf to Smart, 26 August 1943, Random House Collection).\n\nRandom House rolled through the war years with increasing momentum. The firm was fortunate in that Klopfer was the only senior member who left to enter the service. Commins, several years older than Cerf, remained at Random House throughout the war, as did Haas, who was in his early fifties. It was Haas, however, who was touched most deeply by the war. His son, a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy, was killed in action in 1943.\n\nRandom House had grown slowly in the 1930s. Each year sales increased over the previous year, but the increases were often small. The firm’s sales did not reach a million dollars until 1941. Beginning with sales of \\$256,000 in 1926, it took Cerf and Klopfer fifteen years to reach the million-dollar figure. Thereafter, sales increased rapidly. Cerf wrote in 1943, “I think we have reached the major leagues as publishers now, and I damn well mean for us to stay there” (Cerf to Smart, 26 August 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\n\nPart of Random House’s wartime growth could be attributed to a series of best-selling war books. The firm’s first big seller in this category was Cecil Brown’s *Suez to Singapore*, about the sinking of the British battleship *Prince of Wales* and the battle cruiser *Repulse* several days after Pearl Harbor. It appeared in August 1942. Shortly thereafter came Richard Tregaskis’s *Guadalcanal Diary*, published in January 1943. It was the first Random House book to sell over 100,000 copies (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 163). Random House’s next big war book was *Thirty Seconds over Tokyo* by Ted W. Lawson.\n\nDuring the war Cerf began to be well-known to the public at large as a writer and speaker. He took over the “Trade Winds” column in *Saturday Review of Literature* in February 1942. For the next fifteen years he enlivened the magazine’s pages with a weekly mixture of publishing gossip, jokes, and stories. He also began to compile what became a long series of best-selling humor books. The first, *The Pocket Book of War Humor*, was an original paperback published by Pocket Books early in 1943. It was a collection, edited by Cerf, of previously published material. His objective in compiling it was to do something to dispel the widespread despondency that followed the American loss of the Philippines and Bataan (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 174). The book sold over a million copies.\n\nCerf’s next project was a collection of humorous anecdotes and stories, *Try and Stop Me*, published by Simon and Schuster in 1944. It became a bestseller and was widely distributed in an Armed Services Edition to members of the armed services around the world. “It was just the kind of book they needed and appreciated—it made them laugh,” Cerf later recalled (*At Random*, p. 181). He subsequently wrote many other humor books, but he always regarded *Try and Stop Me* as his best (*At Random*, p. 180). The book led to a newspaper column syndicated to several hundred newspapers by King Features. Also called “Try and Stop Me,” it started as a serialization of the book, but when that material was used up, Cerf supplied new stories and jokes to keep the column going. But Cerf never overestimated his own publications. In a 1945 letter to Gertrude Stein, whom he had not seen since before the war, he wrote:\n\n> You write asking whether I have changed any since you saw me last. I honestly don’t think I have. I am a bit grayer, of course, and don’t get around a tennis court quite as fast as I used to, but I like to think that my whole attitude to life hasn’t changed a bit. Certainly I am getting more fun out of it today than I ever did before. Besides the publishing, which has gone beautifully, I have been writing trivia for magazines and in book form and, while I know it is utterly unimportant drivel, people seem to like it and want more of it (Cerf to Gertrude Stein, 17 March 1945, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\n\nWhen a reader wrote Cerf in 1954 suggesting that his humor books be brought together and published as a ML Giant, he responded that he was flattered. “But quite honestly,” he added, “I’m not good enough” (Cerf to Ralph Winans, 22 July 1954, Random House Collection).\n\nCerf was as engaging a speaker as he was a writer. His first major exposure came with tours of well-known writers selling war bonds for the Treasury Department. This was followed by a weekly radio program for the Council of Books in Wartime called “Books Are Bullets” in which he interviewed authors of war books. The radio program led to lecture tours through the Colston Leigh Agency. By the early 1950s, through extensive lecturing and, even more so, as a result of his participation as a regular panelist on the Sunday evening television program “What’s My Line,” Cerf had become a celebrity. He enjoyed being a celebrity, and the publicity he attracted brought enhanced recognition of Random House among the public at large. The War Production Board was established in January 1942, a few weeks after the United States entered the war. Its purpose was to direct war production and assign priorities to the delivery of scarce materials. Paper use in the publishing industry was limited in the fall of 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota based on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were restricted to 90 per cent of the amount of paper they used before the war. This was not a severe hardship, especially compared with Britain, where publishers in 1942 were having to get by with 37½ per cent of the paper they used in 1939 (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 29 August 1942, p. 20). But the restrictions became increasingly severe as the war went on. There was an additional 10 per cent cut in 1943, and a further 15 per cent cut the following year (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 26 August 1943; Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).] Thirteen titles were added during 1942 and five titles were discontinued. This brought the number of titles in the ML list to 227. Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with lettering in gold on inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. The enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through spring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers featured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by pattern of open books and “ml” initials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through spring 1966. All 1942 jackets were individually designed except *Collected Stories of Dorothy Parker* (353)*,* which used a decorative non-pictorial jacket designed by Paul Galdone that was used on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s. Galdone was also responsible for three other jackets: Ward, *Oracles of Nostradamus* (346); Lewis, *Babbitt* (348); and Hellman, *Four Plays* (351). Joseph Blumenthal designed three typographic jackets: Tacitus, *Complete Works* (350); Milton, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (354); and Santayana, *Philosophy* (355). E. McKnight Kauffer was responsible for three pictorial jackets: Wright, *Native Son* (349); Maurois, *Disraeli* (352); and Bellamy, *Looking Backward* (357). The designers of two pictorial jackets, Crane, *Red Badge of Courage* (347) and Byrne, *Messer Marco Polo* (356), have not been identified. 95 cents. (Spring) Lewis, *Babbitt* xMaurois, *Disraeli*; Giants through G58 with G21 *Sixteen Famous American Plays*; jackets: 281. (Fall) Maurois, *Disraeli* xDu Maurier, *Rebecca*; Giants through G60; jackets: 284.\n\n*Note:* New titles for fall 1942 have spring 1942 lists of ML titles inside the jackets. This oversight probably reflects the absence of Klopfer, who had been responsible for the printing and production of ML books before his departure in May to serve in the Air Force. Lists of ML titles at the end of the volumes were not affected. Both of the fall 1942 titles that include lists—Parker, *Collected Stories* (353) and Milton, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (354a)—have fall 1942 lists at the end of the volume No war books as such were included in the ML. Cerf tried to secure reprint rights to Hitler’s *Mein Kampf* for the ML, but Houghton Mifflin, the original American publisher, was bringing out a new edition of their own (Cerf to Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 4 November 1942; Linscott to Cerf, 6 November 1942).\n\nShortly after Random House published *The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne & Complete Poetry of William Blake* (RH, 1941; ML Giant, 1946) W. H. Auden suggested a ML volume of poetry by Andrew Marvell, George Herbert, and Henry Vaughan. Commins responded, “You have probably guessed that the Donne-Blake book has most of its sales in colleges where both poets are considered in every course on English literature. This does not apply to Marvell, Herbert or Vaughan . . . such a book would not achieve sufficient sales to cover the very high cost of manufacturing it” (Commins to Auden, 14 January 1942).\n\nHenry Hoyns, a veteran employee of Harper & Bros. who had recently been appointed president of the firm, suggested Louis Adamic’s *Grandsons*, Evelyn Eaton’s *Quietly My Captain Waits*, André Maurois’s *Chateaubriand*, and Frederic Prokosch’s *The Seven Who Fled* for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 19 January 1942), but none of these Harper titles was appropriate for the series. Hoyns subsequently suggested a ML edition of Hesketh Pearson’s biography, *Gilbert and Sullivan* (Harper, 1935), but Cerf thought it would more appropriate for the Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday imprint that specialized in reprint editions (Cerf to Hoyns, 15 September 1942).\n\nHarry E. Maule, a Random House editor, suggested a ML edition of Sinclair Lewis’s *Main Street* (Maule to Cerf, 12 March 1942), but Lewis’s *Babbitt* (348) had been added to the series a month before. Lewis himself suggested a ML volume of the poetry of Carl Sandberg, Vachel Lindsay, and Edgar Lee Masters, but Cerf indicated that it might be impossible to obtain reprint rights (Cerf to Sinclair Lewis, 14 September, 1942).\n\nKlopfer rejected a suggestion by Marshall Best of Viking Press for a ML edition of Upton Sinclair’s *The Jungle*, stating “the book is dated” (Klopfer to Best, 31 March 1942). George Duplaix suggested *The True History of the Conquest of Mexico* by Bernal Díaz del Castillo. Max Lerner suggested Maxim Gorky’s autobiographical trilogy, *My Childhood*, *In the World*, and *My Universities*, with an introduction by his former wife, Anita Marburg (Lerner to Commins, 1 December 1942).\n\nCerf made the first of several attempts to secure reprint rights to Aldous Huxley’s *Brave New World*. It would be another fourteen years before Huxley’s novel appeared in the series. Cerf wanted to add [Antoine de Saint-Exupery](http://www.amazon.com/Antoine-de-Saint-Exupery/e/B000AQ4I8O/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1)’s *Wind, Sand and Stars* to the ML in late 1942 or early 1943 (Cerf to Eugene Reynal, 6 February 1942), but reprint rights do not appear to have been available. Other works sought for the ML that never appeared in the series included Archibald MacLeish’s selected poems and James Henry Breasted’s *Conquest of Civilization* (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, 31 July 1942).

Klopfer, who was thirty-nine, applied for a commission in the Air Force. He was commissioned as a captain in May 1942 and left for training in California at the end of the month. He was away from Random House until after the war. The war years were good ones for him. He was posted to England with the Eighth Air Force in October 1943 and served as an intelligence officer for a heavy bomber squadron—the job he wanted. When he stopped by Random House to say his final goodbyes before leaving for London, Cerf thought he looked “happier and more excited than I have ever seen him in my life before” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library). Early the following year he was promoted to major (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 12 February 1944, p. 19). [object Object]",

They turned in large numbers to reading as an alternative. Demand for books was such that almost anything publishers brought out was snatched-up. Few publishers had ever encountered such demand for books and the experience was dazzling. But it also had drawbacks. “When you are able to sell any junk that you can get between covers,” Cerf commented, “it takes the kick out of putting over the really good numbers” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943). Between 1942 and 1943, sales of ML books increased from \\$339,902 to \\$596,454. \n\nThe war brought not only increased demand for books in general but also shifts in demand for certain types of books. Books dealing with the war itself were popular. But there also seems to have been increased demand for books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry and philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a disproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong among men in the service. \n\nThe Modern Library’s most notable new venture in the 1940s was a series called the Illustrated Modern Library. It was launched in 1943 in the midst of the war. Each volume contained specially commissioned illustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell, Salvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz Kredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes were one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in individually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943 in time for the Christmas season. Fourteen additional titles were issued between 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library initially sold for \\$1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war forced the discontinuation of the series. Seven titles were added to the series and three were discontinued, bringing the total number of titles in the list to 231. Titles published in 1943 were 7¼ x 4⅞ inch page size with individually designed title pages. Many of the title pages were designed by Joseph Blumenthal, who set them at his Spiral Press and made electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printers. The binding, also designed by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth linen. Blumenthal’s binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or dark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped in gold. Kent’s torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on the spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were bordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside each panel. \n\nThe bindings were red, blue, green, or gray. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings used from 1929 through spring 1939, each printing of a given title was available in only one color. \n\nRockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ by 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers; for the rest of the endpapers, there were torchbearers on the paste-down and free endpapers facing each other, light brownish gray (63); endpapers in medium orange (53). 95 cents (Spring) Du Maurier, *Rebecca* xShakespeare; Giants through G62; jackets: 291. (Fall) Shakespeare xJefferson, *Life and Selected Writings*; Giants through G63; jackets: 292. McKeon had an idea for a collection entitled *Medieval Philosophers*. Cerf asked Hoyns for reprint rights to Fosdick’s *On Being a Real Person*, saying it was “one of the finest books that has been published in the past ten years,” and offering a \\$5,000 advance (Cerf to Hoyns, 12 November 1943). \n\nHoyns suggested Silone’s *The Seed Beneath the Snow* and Algren’s *Never Come Morning* for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 20 May 1943). \n\nCerf declined to add an Elizabeth Bowen novel, noting “I don’t think that there will be a sufficient demand for any of Elizabeth Bowen’s novels to justify such an addition to the Modern Library series” (Cerf to Brown, 20 July 1943).

Barnes & Co., Inc.*  </center>\n\n<center> *Distributed by Random House, Inc.* </center>\n\nPaper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in demand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable to satisfy the demand for books. \n\nThe War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry in fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota based on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to 90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions became increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional 10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year. \n\nMost publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a few—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In fall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the textbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated Modern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board requirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series while RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles, including those noted above, were also published under this arrangement. The ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several other publishers that had surplus paper. \n\nThe War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in March 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers were able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from college text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for the duration [of the war]. We counted on doing the same this year. When the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire production schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944). \n\nAll subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by Random House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML stopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued to appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to go out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The profit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants were paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML books, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length. \n\nA. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the Illustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was limited. Random House continued to select titles for the series, commission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate making, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were reprinted. Nine titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now contained 239 titles. The 1943 format was unchanged for the 1944 publications. All new titles in the regular ML were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x 118 mm). Bindings were red, blue, green or gray. Rockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ x 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers. 95 cents (Spring) Jefferson, *Life and Selected Writings* xParker, *Collected Poetry*; Giants through G65 (=fall 1944); jackets: 299.

In the later part of 1945, no Giants were available except the newly published *Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry*. There was no prospect of the Modern Library being completely in-stock again, Cerf wrote, for “a full year from now or even longer, depending entirely on the progress of the global war and the restoration of the normal paper supply in the book business” (Cerf to H. Hugh Herbert, 26 April, 1945). Eight titles were added and two were discontinued, bringing the total number of ML titles to 245.

Hugh Herbert, 26 April, 1945). [object Object]",

The firm had occupied rented offices at 20 East 57th Street since 1927 but had to move after International Business Machines (IBM) bought the building. The jackets of the first ML printings of *The Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau* (384) and Koestler’s *Darkness at Noon* (385) list the old address on the back panel. The Madison Avenue address appears on the back panel beginning with Hersey’s *A Bell for Adano* (386), published in April. The Madison Avenue building consisted of the north wing of a mansion originally built in 1885 for Henry Villard. The north wing (one of five separate units) was owned for many years by the Fahnestock family and had been purchased by Joseph P. Kennedy in 1944. Random House bought it from Kennedy for \\$420,000 and spent an additional \\$100,000 renovating and furnishing it. Eleven titles were added and five were discontinued, bringing the total number of titles to 251. New titles issued in 1946 in the regular ML were published in the standard format used over the war years with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x 118 mm). Bindings were brown, blue, green or gray. \n\nInset panels of brown bindings were usually black; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. \n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold on all titles. \n\nRockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ x 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers. 95 cents (January–October); \\$1.10 (November–December). The price increase was the first for the regular ML since May 1920. The first new title published at \\$1.10 was Rawlings, *The Yearling* (391), but the \\$1.10 price was short lived. The retail price increased to \\$1.25 on 15 April 1947. The ML printed the list price at the top of the jacket flap, and first printings of titles published at 95 cents and \\$1.10 are commonly found in price-clipped jackets.

(Fall) Balzac, *Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet* xAristotle, *Introduction*; Giants through G70; jackets: 316. William Rose, Jr., the president of Harper &Brothers, cancelled a proposed ML reprint of James Henry Breasted’s *The Conquest of Civilization* (1926; rev. ed., 1938), noting that the book was basically a trade edition of Breasted’s textbook *Ancient Times* (Ginn & Co., 1916; 2nd ed., 1935). Ginn was concerned that a 95-cent ML edition would hurt sales of *Ancient Times* in college towns (Rose to Cerf, 5 July 1946). Klopfer rejected a suggestion to include H. G. Wells’s *History of Mr. Polly* in the ML (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 9 September 1946). The ML also decided against Sigmund Freud’s *Leonardo da Vinci* (Dodd, Mead, 1932), which was not included in *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* (Giant, 1938). A. A. Brill, who had translated *Leonardo da Vinci* and edited the Giant, sent a copy to Commins for consideration, indicating that Dodd, Mead was willing to return all rights to the book (A. A. Brill to Commins, 4 October 1946). The length of *Leonardo da Vinci*—just 130 pages—was a problem. It never appeared in the ML, but fifteen years later it was published in Vintage Books, Random House’s quality paperback series.

Frank Taylor and Albert Erskine joined the editorial staff in 1947 after becoming dissatisfied at Reynal & Hitchcock. Saxe Commins, one of the great editors of his era, remained editor in chief of the Modern Library. Although officially in charge of the series at this period, judging from evidence in the Random House archives, his involvement was small. \n\nSales at Random House continued to grow. With Giants back in-stock after the paper rationing of the war years, sales increased from their low in 1945 of \\$92,085 to \\$544,632 in 1947. Sales of titles in the regular ML also continued to increase; \\$834,907 in 1946 to \\$946,415 in 1947. Ten titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now contained 260 titles. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Two shades of gray (265 med.; 266 dk.) were used for the binding. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. \\$1.10 (January–14 April); \\$1.25 (15 April–December). Three of the spring titles (*Introduction to Aristotle*, *The Best Short Stories of Bret Harte*, and *The Eustace Diamonds*) were published at \\$1.10. *The Best of S. J. Perelman* (395) and Caldwell, *Tobacco Road* (397) did not appear until May and were published with \\$1.25 price stickers on the jacket flaps. All fall titles were published at \\$1.25. \n\nThe \\$1.10 retail price introduced in November 1946 lasted for less than six months. Costs continued to rise, and Klopfer advised Cerf in February that another price increase was likely. Cerf, who was vacationing in Beverly Hills, replied: “If we <u>must</u> boost ML to \\$1.25, let’s get it over with, & for God’s sake alter jacket copy so that price appears <u>only</u> on detachable flap. Some stores out here are selling ML <u>without</u> jackets to avoid squabbles on price. This ain’t good!” (Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947; Cerf to Klopfer, 23 February 1947, underlining in original). \n\nBeginning in fall 1947 the retail price was printed on the top corner of the jacket flap where it could be clipped off easily, and the price was omitted from the back panel of the jacket. Since most of the jackets in stores still bore the printed price of \\$1.10 or even 95 cents, booksellers were supplied with gummed price-change stickers to be affixed to the flaps. These read: “As of April 15, 1947, the price of The Modern Library in U.S.A. is \\$1.25 a copy. Other markings void. The Modern Library, Inc.” (Spring) Aristotle, *Introduction* xLewis, *Dodsworth*; Giants through G71; jackets: 322. (Fall) Lewis, *Dodsworth* xAquinas, *Introduction*; Giants through G72; jackets: 329. Cerf continued to make offers for James Stephens, *The* *Crock of Gold*, but was informed that Macmillan still planned to reissue it (James Putnam to Cerf, 8 May 1947). The Macmillan reprint appeared later that year. He also wanted Lytton Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex* for the ML, but the Harcourt, Brace edition was selling too well as a textbook. S. Spenser Scott of Harcourt, Brace wrote Cerf, “I am sure that you will agree that the Modern Library books do compete with the textbook editions—and well they should, because you have done a grand job on getting them into college stores” (Scott to Cerf, 24 September 1947). \n\nCerf declined Wendell Wilkie’s *One World* when Manuel Siwek of Grosset & Dunlap suggested it for the ML (Cerf to Siwek, 10 June 1947). He also rejected Wallace Stegner’s novel *Big Rock Candy Mountain*, indicating that the plates were too large for the regular series and that it wouldn’t have sufficient sales for Modern Library Giants (Cerf to Charles Duell, 2 October 1947).

Rose also offered reprint rights to Thomas Wolfe’s *You Can’t Go Home Again*, but Klopfer appears to have considered that Wolfe was adequately represented by *Look Homeward, Angel*, which had been available as a ML Giant since 1934 (Klopfer to Rose, 27 September 1948).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1949 1949 The postwar history of the Modern Library can be regarded as dating from the beginning of 1949. That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two major developments: the continuing expansion and consolidation of the paperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that increased the importance of the college market. \n\nCerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning. He tried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in paperback Pocket Book editions. When the ML had exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing them. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books to publish two titles that deGraff wanted: Vincent Sheean’s *Personal History*, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving Stone’s *Lust for Life*, which had been in the ML for less than a year. \n\nOften the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works. The terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances in which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset & Dunlap or other hardbound reprint edition. Even if the ML had exclusive reprint rights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year intervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release paperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from the ML when the contract expired. \n\nBefore the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback editions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier by the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously affect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality paperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library Paperbacks. \n\nRandom House responded to growth in the college market for quality books earlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950 under the direction of Jess Stein. Eleven new titles were added to the ML and five were discontinued, bringing the total number of titles in the regular series to 271. Modern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single-color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. \\$1.25.

(Fall) Byron, *Don Juan* xJames, *Washington Square*; Giants through G73 with G9 DeQuincey, *Selected Writings*; jackets: 344. Morton Dauwen Zabel, professor of English at the University of Chicago, suggested a ML edition of Joseph Conrad’s *Under Western Eyes*. He wrote, “I can think of no novel of Conrad’s outside of Lord Jim, Victory, and Heart of Darkness (all of them already included in the Modern Library) which more deserves to be known. The general neglect of it, hitherto, is a shame” (Zabel to Jess Stein, 31 October 1949). Stein forwarded the suggestion to Cerf, but the general consensus was that there was insufficient demand to justify a ML edition.

All of the early titles were taken from the regular Modern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold initially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular Modern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they were issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward the academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a distinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new series had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath Brooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson, Royal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray, Mark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and Morton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in regular Modern Library printings as well. \n\nMany of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken over the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often than not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met. In contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College Editions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They were, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was beginning to eat into the Modern Library’s college market with their regular Modern Library series. \n\nThat series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart & Co. in late 1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics aimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to seventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound volumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were well-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics. \n\nThe Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess Stein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions from the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore orders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois. \n\nThe Random House juvenile department, already well established with such authors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to the firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched in 1950. Nine new titles were added and four discontinued in the regular ML series, bringing the total titles to 276. There were an additional 74 titles in the Giants. The Modern Library College Editions launched with 41 titles of non-royalty-bearing works. Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. \\$1.25. (Spring) James, *Washington Square* xAlcott, *Little Women*; Giants through G74; jackets: 347. (Fall) Alcott, *Little Women* xCicero, *Basic Works*; Giants through G75 with G57 Brooks, *Flowering of New England*; jackets: 348. Gordon S. Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot’s *Middlemarch* for ML College Editions and offered to write an introduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six months later: “You will find all the contemporary English critics like Leavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf’s opinion about *Middlemarch* as the great novel of the 19th Century. It is back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will be a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and World’s Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by the time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who have anticipated the change in critical estimate” (Haight to Stein, 15 June 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML’s new paperback series, Modern Library College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published at the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, “There are some titles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far are assured top sellers, while *Middlemarch*, although rated high critically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as, say, *Anna Karenina*. . . . The status of *Middlemarch* on our list here is simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at least break even on *Middlemarch* we will include it” (Stein to Haight, 20 June 1950). *Middlemarch* (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984. \n\nJess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph Conrad’s *Nostromo* and *The Nigger of the Narcissus*, Theodore Dreiser’s *An American Tragedy*, George Eliot’s *Adam Bede*, Oliver Goldsmith’s *Vicar of Wakefield*, three works by Henry James (*Daisy Miller*, *The American*, and *The Golden Bowl*), Franz Kafka’s *The Castle*, Jack London’s *Call of the Wild*, Lucretius’s *On the Nature of Things*, Frank Norris’s *The Pit*, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s *Quo Vadis*, Ignazio Silone’s *Bread and Wine*, Edmund Spenser’s *Faerie Queen*, Henri Stendhal’s *Charterhouse of Parma*, Mark Twain’s *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*, Edith Wharton’s *Ethan Frome*, Owen Wister’s *The Virginian*, and Emile Zola’s *Germinal* (Stein to Cerf, 10 October 1950). The following titles on Stein’s list were published in the regular series or ML Giants: Conrad, *Nostromo* (1951: 438); Dreiser, *An American Tragedy* (1950: G89); Goldsmith, *Vicar of Wakefield and Other Writings* (1955: 476); Kafka, *The Castle* (1969: 610); and Spenser, *Selected Poetry* (1964: G104). Twain’s *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* was available as part of a ML Giant that included *Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as a volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein’s list were former ML titles that had been discontinued: James, *Daisy Miller; An International Episode* (1918: 60) and Stendhal, *Charterhouse of Parma* (1937: 298). \n\nSomerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James’s *[Principles of Psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology)y* (Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume of Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to Stein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been enthusiastic about the proposal.

Harcourt, Brace never added it to the new series, and *Flowering Judas* was restored to the ML in spring 1953. \n\n#### ***Spring*** In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library College Editions. All of the early titles were taken from the regular Modern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold initially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular Modern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they were issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward the academic community.

The series maintained close ties with the regular Modern Library series during this time. Most titles continued to be selected from the regular Modern Library series and adapted with new introductions for the college market. However, anthologies of works by Browning, Byron, Keats, and Shelley were compiled especially for Modern Library College Editions. The Keats and Shelley anthologies were also published in the regular Modern Library in spring 1951; the Browning and Byron volumes were added to the regular series in 1954. \n\nTen additional titles were added to the College Editions in January, 1951. In contrast to the initial group of forty-one non-royalty bearing titles, several of those added in 1951 required royalty payments. Despite these additions, the Modern Library College Editions began to encounter difficulties in its second year. Production costs were going up and college enrollments temporarily declined as the pool of former soldiers attending college on the G.I bill exhausted. The series did not fully recover until 1956. Thereafter, sales continued to be strong. The series maintained its position in the 1960s when the regular Modern Library began to falter and continued throughout the 1970s after the regular series became moribund. Twelve new titles were added to the series and two titles were superseded by more current editions. This brought the total titles available to 288. All new titles were published in the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal, Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray, and the top edge stained to match the inset panels on the spine and front cover.

Jess Stein, who came to Random House after the war to work on *The American College Dictionary* and stayed to work with reference books and college texts, was the first to alert Random House of the implications of this development. He alerted Lewis Miller in the following memo: \n\n> I now have a little more information about the Doubleday paperbacks which were the subject of the rumor I heard yesterday. This new series apparently will appear in April with 12 titles and prices will range from 65¢ to 95¢. The type of material in these books will be the kind that usually appears in the Mentor series (Stein, Memorandum to Miller, 18 September 1952). \n\nDoubleday and Charles Scribner’s Sons were two of the publishing houses that withdrew reprint contracts for some of the best titles in the Modern Library during 1952. The Scribner’s withdrawal was especially difficult for the Modern Library, since the titles were the best-known works of Ernest Hemingway. The firm had decided to promote its backlist more vigorously. When plans were made to issue Hemingway’s works in a uniform edition, Scribner’s decided to terminate the Modern Library’s reprint contracts. \n\nCerf was dismayed at the news. Losing Hemingway from the Modern Library was an unwelcome prospect. As Klopfer stated later, “The Modern Library has enormous prestige as a series of literary books and there are very few living American authors who deserve to be included in it, and certainly Ernest Hemingway belongs there” (Klopfer to Darrow, 13 July 1954). Eight titles were added and six were discontinued, bringing titles in the list to 290. New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover.

He wanted to publish a ML edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *Tender is the Night* (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, 10 April 1952). He also wanted to include a book by John Galsworthy in the series but was not interested in any of the titles that Scribner’s were willing to consider.

In 1954, Cerf commented, “Our business gross continues to be fine, but more and more it’s the staples and Modern Library and Landmarks. The new novels are simply not selling at all” (Cerf to Klopfer, 15 September 1954). \n\nSaxe Commins, officially the editor-in-chief for the Modern Library, suffered a heart attack in August 1953 and had little involvement with the Modern Library thereafter. Jess Stein was placed in charge of the Modern Library during Commins’s illness and he remained in charge after Commins’s return. Responsibility for the series was added to his existing oversight for the Modern Library College Editions. Nine titles were added, four titles were discontinued, and one title was superseded.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1954 1954 In 1954, Random House entered into negotiations with Allen Lane, the founder and head of Penguin Books in England, to explore the possibility of Random House’s acquiring the American branch of the firm. Initially, Random House was attracted by the idea of obtaining rights for the Modern Library of a number of new translations commissioned for Penguin Classics, a distinguished and highly successful series that began in 1946. Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had been criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux’s 1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes’s *Don Quixote*; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *Iliad* and *Odyssey*; Constance Garnett’s translation of Chekhov’s *Plays*; and anonymous translations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had superior translations of these and other works. \n\nIn March 1954, Klopfer received a letter from Milton Waldman of the British publishing firm Rupert Hart-Davis, who wrote that Lane had expressed an interest in arranging for joint publication of various classics with the Modern Library (Milton Waldman to Klopfer, 31 March 1954). Jess Stein was given the job of examining the translations in Penguin Classics. He prepared a long memorandum for Klopfer in which he indicated which Penguin translations would be desirable for the Modern Library. However, nothing came of the negotiations with Lane and in 1955, Random House launched the Modern Library Paperbacks. Eight titles were added and five were discontinued. This brought the number of available titles in the Modern Library to 298. New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. The top edge was stained to match the inset panels on the spine and front cover. \\$1.25 (January–March); \\$1.45 (April–December). All new 1954 titles were published after the increase took effect. (Spring) Byron, *Selected Poetry* xBrowning, *Selected Poetry*; Giants through G78 with G9 DeQuincey, *Selected Writings*; jackets: 370. (Fall) Browning, *Selected Poetry* xFaulkner, *Go Down, Moses*; Giants through G78 with G9 *Great Voices of the Reformation* and G56 Sterne, *Tristram Shandy & A Sentimental Journey*; jackets: 371. The Modern Library sought reprint rights for Rachel Carson’s *The Sea Around Us* (Klopfer to Cerf, 2 February 1954). Cerf asked Harcourt, Brace for Orwell’s *1984*, but was informed that sales were too good for it to be let go (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 23 June 1954). William Collins and Sons contacted the ML about sharing the cost of translating the great Russian novelists for the ML and their Pocket Classics (William Collins to Klopfer, 9 July 1954), but nothing appears to have come of this. E. B. White wrote of a ML offer, “About the Bennett Cerf inquiry, I have no interest at the moment in collecting my ‘early work.’ Most of it is in collected form already, a lot of the rest of it isn’t worth collecting, and I’m not in a collecting mood, nor do I want a Modern Library man to start picking around in my spotty past” (E. B.

Initially, Random House was attracted by the idea of obtaining rights for the Modern Library of a number of new translations commissioned for Penguin Classics, a distinguished and highly successful series that began in 1946. Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had been criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux’s 1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes’s *Don Quixote*; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *Iliad* and *Odyssey*; Constance Garnett’s translation of Chekhov’s *Plays*; and anonymous translations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had superior translations of these and other works. [object Object]",

A Random House memorandum in July outlined a possible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American market. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in America, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin obligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library Paperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August, Cerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on the situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own paper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands” (Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at this point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer wrote Lane: \n\n> Almost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I’ll be delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to Lane, 28 August 1958). \n\nBut the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House expanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with Viking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin. \n\nThe Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original publishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February 1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the Modern Library’s contract for Conrad’s *Victory* and put it into an Anchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because *Victory* was only five years away from entering the public domain. But other significant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking Press withdrew James Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in 1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn. Ten new titles were added to the series. Seven titles were discontinued. Tchekov, *Plays* (1930) was superseded by Chekhov *Best Plays* and Voltaire’s *Candide* (1918) was superseded by Voltaire’s *Candide and Other Writings.* This brought the total in the title list to 305. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray. The binding cloth was red, blue, green, or gray with lettering on inset panels in black on the front cover and spine. \\$1.45.

Cerf asked Richard Watts, Jr., to edit *New Voices in the European Theatre* as a companion volume to the 1955 anthology, *New Voices in the American Theatre* (Cerf to Watts, 11 October 1956). Watts was interested but the book never appeared. John W. Aldridge suggested ten possible ML titles, including a Wodehouse reader, Ford Madox Ford’s *The Good Soldier*, Malcolm Lowry’s *Under the Volcano*, a volume of Nathanael West’s novels, the basic writings of Alfred North Whitehead, a Sherlock Holmes collection in the Giants, a Giant anthology of great short novels, and an anthology of fiction by younger postwar writers (Aldridge to Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Stein liked the Wodehouse and great short novels ideas and noted that Macmillan had turned down earlier proposals for a Whitehead collection (Stein memo to Haydn, undated). Cerf thought the Wodehouse and Whitehead collections and the great short novels and postwar fiction anthologies had possibilities (Cerf to Aldridge, 22 August 1956). Aldridge submitted a tentative table of contents for *Great American Short Novels*, but the only ML title that resulted from his proposals was Wodehouse’s *Selected Stories* (1958: 505).

Publishers at this period, however, feared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off raising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no alternative. The \\$1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954. It increased to \\$1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1 January 1957, the price rose again, this time to \\$1.65. \n\nAs long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the Modern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents per copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the retail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers to whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties were going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no general policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to be paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only when pressure from individual authors and publishers left no alternative. \n\nIn 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in royalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of Little, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions. \n\nRandom House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause concerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the Modern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed figure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s own authors in the event of price increases. \n\nSales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing steadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark for the first time in 1957.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1958 1958 In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the Modern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason Epstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at Doubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books pioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other publishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a brilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the publishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who also admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and difficult to work with. \n\nPart of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an independent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library, which Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make his fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after several years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for Modern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern Library itself. \n\nDespite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of the series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another person, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have saved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have accelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital up-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been abandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or because to do the job right would have been too expensive for the potential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of contemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s image as a series of indisputably significant books. \n\nEpstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a change from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the Modern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had always been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial success had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series might have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at a minimum. Nine titles were added and six were discontinued. Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (1931) was superseded by Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings.* This brought the list of available titles to 312. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.

Moses Hadas suggested a ML reprint of the edition of ten plays of Euripides that he and John Harvey McLean had translated (Dial Press, 1936), but Penguin Books and New American Library had both recently published inexpensive new translations and Jason Epstein thought the ML should wait (Epstein to Hadas, 14 November 1958). In the end the ML reprinted the University of Chicago Press’s *Complete Greek Tragedie*s, edited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore (4 vols., 1959; ML reprint, 7 volumes, 1960–63). Eric Bentley suggested a book of six Lope de Vega plays (Bentley to Epstein, 16 November 1958).

As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on the verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959, publishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book Company, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin, Macmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12 October 1959, p. 27). \n\nOn 2 October 1959, Random House became a public corporation: 222,060 shares of Random House stock were placed on sale at \\$11.25 a share. Cerf and Klopfer remained firmly in control of the firm; the stock sold to the public represented only 30 percent of Random House’s total stock. As a result of the sale, Cerf and Klopfer each received a check for more than a million dollars. \n\nMaking Random House a public organization changed the nature of the business. Cerf has written: \n\n> Suddenly Random House embarked on its financial career and expansion. This marked a big change, since the minute you go public, outsiders own some of your stock and you’ve got to make periodic reports to them. You owe your investors dividends and profits. Instead of working for yourself and doing what you damn please, willing to risk a loss on something you want to do, if you’re any kind of honest man, you feel a real responsibility to your stockholders. It was a very important decision (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 277–78). \n\nThe following year, Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and its outstanding quality paperback line, Vintage Books. But while Random House and publishing in general were thriving, the 1950s marked the end of the growth of the Modern Library. By the mid-1960s, interest in the Modern Library on the part of the public was low and the series was in serious trouble. Ten titles were added and two were discontinued, bringing the total to 320. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray. The binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset panels in black on the front cover and spine. \\$1.65 (Spring) Auden, *Selected Poetry* xSalinger, *Nine Stories*; Giants through G82 with G38 Rolland, *Jean-Christophe* (=fall 1959/spring 1960); jackets: 385. (Fall) Salinger, *Nine Stories* xColette, *Six Novels*; Giants through G82 with G38 Rolland, *Jean-Christophe* (=spring 1959/spring 1960); jackets: 388 (=spring 1960). Jason Epstein, who moved from Alfred A. Knopf to Random House around this time, had many ideas for the ML. He expressed interest in Samuel Johnson’s *Lives of the Poets*. He asked William Barnett and Morton White to edit a book on modern philosophy for ML Giants, indicating that it could sell 15,000–20,000 copies a year (Epstein to White, 24 February 1959). Mark Van Doren, who had edited *The Poetry of John Dryden* (Harcourt, Brace & Howe, 1920) nearly forty years earlier, declined an invitation to edit a collection of Dryden’s works for the ML (Van Doren to Epstein, 20 May 1959). Epstein asked William Arrowsmith, whose translation of Petronius, *Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press, 1959) had recently appeared, to translate *Aristophanes* for the ML, indicating that he thought it would earn annual royalties between \\$500 and \\$1,000 (Epstein to Arrowsmith, 23 October 1959). He invited F. W. Dupee to translate a selection of the works of the Marquis de Sade for the ML; as a second choice he expressed interest in a translation of Flaubert’s *Sentimental Education* (Epstein to Dupee, 17 November 1959). \n\nCerf wanted to include the one-volume edition of James George Frazer’s *The Golden Bough* (Macmillan, 1922) in ML Giants and asked C. Edgar Phreaner Jr. to seek rights (Phreaner to Cerf, 27 July 1959). He offered Little, Brown an advance of \\$6,000 for Edith Hamilton, *Mythology*, originally published in 1942 (Cerf to Arthur Thornhill, 26 October 1959), and he asked Professor William Alfred of Harvard University about translations for a volume of Middle English literature for the ML, saying “It would be a good idea, I think, for the Modern Library to include an Anthology of this type” (Cerf to Alfred, 17 November 1959). None of these works were added to the ML. \n\nSeveral of Epstein’s suggestions resulted in additions to the series: *A Kierkegaard Anthology* (1959: 518), Dickens, *Our Mutual Friend* (1960: 524), and the Bernard Guilbert Guerney translation of Turgenev, *Fathers and Sons* (1917: 20.2a), which replaced the Constance Garnett translation in the ML in 1961 (Epstein to Klopfer, 12 January 1959). Other titles suggested by Epstein included Goodspeed’s translation of *The Apocrypha* (1962: 541), *The Space Handbook* (ML Paperbacks, November 1959), and Bernard Malamud’s *The Magic Barrel* (ML Paperbacks, April 1960). \n\nEpstein offered a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights to the William Arrowsmith translation of Petronius, *Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press, 1959) but withdrew the offer when he discovered that a paperback edition would be published by Mentor Books (Epstein to Fred D. Wieck, 30 November 1959). *An Anthology of Russian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak*, edited by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, was considered for the ML but was published in 1960 as a Random House trade book. Other titles considered included E. M. W. Tillyard, *The Elizabethan World Picture*; Jacob Bronowski, *The Common Sense of Science*; and *Five Plays* of Eugene O’Neill. *A Documentary History of Communism*, edited by Robert V. Daniels, was considered for the ML but was postponed (Minutes of ML Meeting, 5 February 1959); it ended up being published in two volumes in Vintage Books. \n\nEpstein wanted to strengthen the ML’s offerings of poetry. He suggested volumes devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer, the Cavalier Poets (Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, and Richard Lovelace) and collections of the poetry of Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Samuel Johnson, Christopher Smart, W. S. Landor, Robert Burns, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also suggested publishing several longer poems as separate ML volumes, including Wordsworth’s *The Prelude*, Browning’s *The Ring and the Book*, Edmund Spenser’s *The Faerie Queen*, and the narrative poems of William Butler Yeats (Epstein to Andrew Chiappe, 6 February 1959). None of these proposals came to fruition. \n\nCharles Singleton, professor of humanities studies at Johns Hopkins University, signed a contract to prepare a new translation of Dante’s *Divine Comedy* for the ML, for which he received a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 6½ percent of the retail price. In the end the project took longer than expected and expanded beyond the single volume that the ML anticipated. Singleton’s edition was published in six volumes by Princeton University Press between 1970 and 1975. Each of the three parts—*Inferno*, *Purgatorio*, and *Paradiso—*consisted of a volume containing the Italian text and Singleton’s translation and a volume of commentary by Singleton. \n\nEpstein was also looking for new translations of several works that were already in the ML. The Ennis Rees translations of Homer’s *Iliad* (1929: 186.2) and *Odyssey* (1929: 187.2), published by Random House in 1960 and 1963, replaced the 19th-century translations of Lang, Leaf and Myers and Butcher and Lang in the ML between 1962 and 1964. The Samuel Putnam translation of Cervantes, *Don Quixote*, published by Viking Press in two volumes in 1949, replaced the Ozell revision of the Motteux translation in 1964 in the regular ML and ML Giants. \n\nOther works that Epstein wanted to include in the ML were *Hindu, Buddhist, and Confucian Traditions* by Theodore de Bary, *Japanese Plays* by Donald Keene, and the forthcoming edition of Pushkin’s *Eugene Onegin,* translated with commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (Bollingen Foundation, 1964). Also being sought were new translations of Homer’s *Odyssey* and *Iliad* and the University of Chicago’s translations of Greek Drama (Epstein to Cerf, 3 September 1959). The ML reprinted the Chicago edition of *The Complete Greek Tragedies* in seven volumes between 1960 and 1963. \n\nAndrew Chiappe suggested Livy’s *Hannibal’s Campaign*, Tolstoy’s *Essays*, Balzac’s *Lost Illusions*, and Terence’s *Comedies* (Chiappe, November 1959). Epstein intended to add Sir Philip Sidney’s *Arcadia*, for which he paid William G. Miller \\$500 for editing work (Epstein to Miller 9 November 1959). Of these only Tolstoy, *Selected Essays* (1964: 564) and Balzac, *Lost Illusions* (1967: G109) appeared in the ML. \n\nKlopfer asked Macmillan for reprint rights to Margaret Mitchell’s *Gone with the Wind* for ML Giants. Macmillan considered the offer seriously but Bruce Brett, the president of the firm, concluded that “this is not the time for it” (Brett to Klopfer, 15 December 1959). \n\nJohn Clive, whose *Macaulay: The Shaping of a Historian* would be published by Knopf in 1973, suggested a ML selection of Macaulay’s works. Epstein declined the proposal, noting that ML titles had to sell “a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 copies a year for a considerable period, which means that it has to be assigned to undergraduates in fairly substantial numbers” (Epstein to Clive, 15 September 1959). *Modern Library Dictionary* (1959–1970) 509 \nAuden, *Selected Poetry* (1959–1971) 510 \nRodgers and Hammerstein, *Six Plays* (1959– ) 511 \nWeidman, *I Can Get It for You Wholesale* (1959–1971) 512 \nJung, *Basic Writings* (1959– ) 513 \nBierstedt, ed., *Making of Society* (1959–1974) 514 \nVasari, *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects* (1959–1970) 515 \nSalinger, *Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516 \nHoward, *World’s Great Operas* (1959–1970) 517 \nKierkegaard, *Kierkegaard Anthology* (1959– ) 518 Hoffenstein, *Complete Poetry of Samuel Hoffenstein* (1954) \nMcCord, ed., *What Cheer* (1955) \n\n#### ***Spring*** During the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had been immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a steady upward climb. As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on the verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959, publishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book Company, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin, Macmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12 October 1959, p. 27).
