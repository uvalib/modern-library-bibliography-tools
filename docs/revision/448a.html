<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The modern theatre keeps a favorite place in its repertory for such
eighteenth-century plays as Gay’s <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em>, Goldsmith’s
<em>She Stoops to Conquer</em> and Sheridan’s <em>The Rivals</em>. Their gaiety, wit
and charm make them as enjoyable to us as the latest Broadway hits.
Equally appealing, though less frequently produced nowadays, are the
other five plays in this volume. All of them make superb reading and
offer great rewards from the treasury of eighteenth-century drama.
Professor Ricardo Quintana, Chairman of the English Department at the
University of Wisconsin, contributes an informative and penetrating
Introduction. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A on coated white paper. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published spring 1952. <em>WR</em> 5 April 1952. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Quintana received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and
selecting the plays (Stein to Quintana, 27 June 1950). The volume was
originally scheduled for MLCE but appeared first in the regular ML.
Textual note on p. [iv]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first
editions, except <em>The London Merchant</em> (sixth edition, 1735), <em>She
Stoops to Conquer</em> (fifth edition, 1773), and <em>The Rivals</em> (third
edition, 1776)—these exceptions being made because the later editions
show changes reliably believed to have been made by the authors.</p>
<p>A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early
editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in
spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small
number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This volume of eighteenth-century plays includes three of the foremost
comedies of the period—<em>The Beggar’s Opera</em> by Gay, <em>She Stoops to
Conquer</em> by Goldsmith and <em>The Rivals</em> by Sheridan. Their biting wit
and satire, combined with elements of farce, have made them enduring
classics. Also included are five lesser-known plays of the period—two
examples of early domestic tragedies: <em>Jane Shore</em> by Rowe and <em>The
London Merchant</em> by Lillo; an early sentimental comedy: <em>The Conscious
Lovers</em> by Steele; a pseudo-classical tragedy: <em>Cato</em> by Addison; and
a burlesque heroic tragedy: <em>The Tragedy of Tragedies</em> by Fielding.
All eight plays offer a comprehensive collection of eighteenth-century
drama. Ricardo Quintana, of the University of Wisconsin English
Department, contributes an informative and penetrating introduction.</p>

For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in\n> spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small\n> number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.\n\n**448b.
