<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
It so happens that this volume, Number 150 in the Modern Library,
appears just ten years [<em>sic</em>] after the first book in the
series—Oscar Wilde’s “Dorian Gray” it was—made its appearance in the
shops. The editors feel that they can show their appreciation of the
support accorded the entire series by booklovers of America in no more
appropriate way than by publishing these reproductions of Whistler’s
beautiful art, with an understanding biography by Elizabeth Robins
Pennell, at the regular Modern Library price. (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “32
Reproductions in the Aquatone Process | With an understanding biography
by <span class="smallcaps">Elizabeth Robins Pennell</span>”. (<em>Spring
1929</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML publication. Text and illustrations printed by the “aquatone
process.” Published August 1928. <em>WR</em> 8 September 1928. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1936.</p>
<p>The ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of
the title page states: “<em>Printed by the</em> <span
class="smallcaps">aquatone process</span> <em>by</em> | <em>Edward Stern &amp;
Company, Inc.</em>”</p>
<p>There were at least two printings of <em>The Art of Whistler</em>. The
statement “<em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | 1928” appears to have been
retained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition”
statement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first
printing; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such
statements on all printings.</p>
<p>The ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’
previous biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97).
<em>The Life of James McNeill Whistler</em> by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and
Joseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B.
Lippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911.
Joseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to
edit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the
manuscript on her own.</p>
<p>Klopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the
manuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss
to determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the
author. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her
home in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his
mid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer
struggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs.
Pennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the
manuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November
1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).</p>
<p>Shortly after publication of <em>The Art of Whistler</em> Klopfer invited Mrs.
Pennell to edit a companion volume, <em>The Art of Joseph Pennell</em> (Klopfer
to Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.</p>
<p>Klopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain
before he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of <em>The
Art of Whistler</em> in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn
near our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we
don’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane,
11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s <em>Lives of the Twelve Caesars</em>
(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no
illustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.</p>

(*Spring 1928*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “32\nReproductions in the Aquatone Process | With an understanding biography\nby <span class=\"smallcaps\">Elizabeth Robins Pennell</span>”. (*Spring\n1929*)\n\nOriginal ML publication. Text and illustrations printed by the “aquatone\nprocess.” Published August 1928. *WR* 8 September 1928. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued fall 1936.\n\nThe ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of\nthe title page states: “*Printed by the* <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">aquatone process</span> *by* | *Edward Stern &\nCompany, Inc.*”\n\nThere were at least two printings of *The Art of Whistler*. The\nstatement “*First Modern Library Edition* | 1928” appears to have been\nretained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition”\nstatement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first\nprinting; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such\nstatements on all printings.\n\nThe ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’\nprevious biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97).\n*The Life of James McNeill Whistler* by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and\nJoseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B.\nLippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911.\nJoseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to\nedit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the\nmanuscript on her own.\n\nKlopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the\nmanuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss\nto determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the\nauthor. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her\nhome in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his\nmid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer\nstruggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs.\nPennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the\nmanuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November\n1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).\n\nShortly after publication of *The Art of Whistler* Klopfer invited Mrs.\nPennell to edit a companion volume, *The Art of Joseph Pennell* (Klopfer\nto Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.\n\nKlopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain\nbefore he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of *The\nArt of Whistler* in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn\nnear our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we\ndon’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane,\n11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s *Lives of the Twelve Caesars*\n(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no\nillustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.\n\n***Fall***",
