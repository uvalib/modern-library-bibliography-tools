<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The foremost authorities of the world are in agreement that <em>The
Charterhouse of Parma</em> is one of the great works of fiction in the
French language. Such writers as Balzac, Nietzsche, Zola, Dowden,
André Gide and Lytton Strachey acclaimed it. <em>The Charterhouse of
Parma</em> finds a distinguished place in the Modern Library series. With
<em>The Red and the Black</em> (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his
two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures
the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (<em>Fall
1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni &amp;
Liveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of <em>The Works of Stendhal</em>. ML edition
(pp. [v]–290; [<em>1</em>]–343) printed from B&amp;L plates. Published January
1937. <em>WR</em> 23 January 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued
fall 1943.</p>
<p>Arthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to
secure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the
reprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an
introduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured
Cerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to
Cerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline; <em>The
Charterhouse of Parma</em> went to press without an introduction, and sales
were disappointing.</p>
<p>Total printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies
(November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March
1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold
copies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth
format, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in
the larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information
about Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears
under “General” in the chapter for 1939.)</p>
<p>Wartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading
matter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to drop <em>The
Charterhouse of Parma</em>, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to
other titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in
fall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among
academics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by
George Mayberry in the <em>New Republic</em> (8 November 1943, p. 661):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Open Letter</p>
<p>The Modern Library, Inc.,</p>
<p>New York City.</p>
<p>Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply
shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and
John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The
Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August
15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if
no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence
in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in
Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for
comment.</p>
<p>One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are
dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be
quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the
ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of
nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently
dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied
invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first
chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no
public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he
somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among
whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed.</p>
<p>You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of
the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold
in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of
time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever
immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of
commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness.</p>
<p>May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great
book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print
will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even
if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up
remaindered copies at Macy’s.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">George Mayberry</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by
Mayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,” <em>New
Republic</em>, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the
Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our
announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma”
from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken?</p>
<p>The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in
1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year,
when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The
Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the
Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under
present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us
that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from
the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the
Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would
have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for
somewhere between four and five years. [<em>This statement was not
strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had
reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time</em>.]</p>
<p>May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop
titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept
there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy
growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine
reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of
obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor
the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their
shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and
quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular
numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is
losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a
favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some
dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the
Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of
eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial
period in actual sales.</p>
<p>Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s
“The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library.
Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The
Charterhouse of Parma.”</p>
<p>BENNETT A. CERF</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original
letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to
the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of
making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep
“such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without
seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the
Modern Library. —G.M.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation of <em>The
Charterhouse of Parma</em> became a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little
magazine <em>Pharos</em> published a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry
Levin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at
Harvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the
publishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against
their country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s
masterpiece <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> because they thought they were
unable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature as
<em>Life with Father</em> and <em>Rebecca</em>” (<em>Pharos</em>, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).</p>
<p>Levin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which
consisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”:
“. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English,
in spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in
America, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal
has received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).</p>
<p>James T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization
of publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in
recent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their
stock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing?
Some Observations on the Future of Books,” <em>New Directions</em> 9, 1946, p.
13).</p>
<p>When Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality”
or “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a
claim to the intellectual audience by making <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em>
his first title.</p>
<p>In 1999, fifty-six years after <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> was
discontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by
Richard Howard. That edition, in paperback, was in print as of 2016.</p>

With\n> *The Red and the Black* (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his\n> two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures\n> the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (*Fall\n> 1936*)\n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni &\nLiveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of *The Works of Stendhal*. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–290; \\[*1*\\]–343) printed from B&L plates. Published January\n1937. *WR* 23 January 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued\nfall 1943.\n\nArthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to\nsecure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the\nreprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured\nCerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to\nCerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline; *The\nCharterhouse of Parma* went to press without an introduction, and sales\nwere disappointing.\n\nTotal printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies\n(November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March\n1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold\ncopies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth\nformat, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in\nthe larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information\nabout Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears\nunder “General” in the chapter for 1939.)\n\nWartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading\nmatter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to drop *The\nCharterhouse of Parma*, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to\nother titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in\nfall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among\nacademics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by\nGeorge Mayberry in the *New Republic* (8 November 1943, p. 661):\n\n> An Open Letter\n>\n> The Modern Library, Inc.,\n>\n> New York City.\n>\n> Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply\n> shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and\n> John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The\n> Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August\n> 15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if\n> no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence\n> in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in\n> Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for\n> comment.\n>\n> One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are\n> dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be\n> quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the\n> ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of\n> nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently\n> dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied\n> invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first\n> chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no\n> public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he\n> somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among\n> whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed.\n>\n> You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of\n> the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold\n> in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of\n> time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever\n> immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of\n> commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness.\n>\n> May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great\n> book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print\n> will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even\n> if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up\n> remaindered copies at Macy’s.\n>\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">George Mayberry</span>\n\nCerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by\nMayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,” *New\nRepublic*, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):\n\n> Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the\n> Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our\n> announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma”\n> from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken?\n>\n> The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in\n> 1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year,\n> when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The\n> Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the\n> Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under\n> present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us\n> that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from\n> the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the\n> Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would\n> have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for\n> somewhere between four and five years. \\[*This statement was not\n> strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had\n> reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time*.\\]\n>\n> May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop\n> titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept\n> there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy\n> growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine\n> reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of\n> obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor\n> the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their\n> shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and\n> quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular\n> numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is\n> losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a\n> favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some\n> dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the\n> Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of\n> eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial\n> period in actual sales.\n>\n> Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s\n> “The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library.\n> Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The\n> Charterhouse of Parma.”\n>\n> BENNETT A. CERF\n\nMayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:\n\n> \\[I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original\n> letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to\n> the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of\n> making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep\n> “such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without\n> seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the\n> Modern Library. —G.M.\\]\n\nIntellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation of *The\nCharterhouse of Parma* became a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little\nmagazine *Pharos* published a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry\nLevin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at\nHarvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the\npublishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against\ntheir country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s\nmasterpiece *The Charterhouse of Parma* because they thought they were\nunable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature as\n*Life with Father* and *Rebecca*” (*Pharos*, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).\n\nLevin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which\nconsisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”:\n“. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English,\nin spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in\nAmerica, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal\nhas received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).\n\nJames T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization\nof publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in\nrecent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their\nstock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing?\nSome Observations on the Future of Books,” *New Directions* 9, 1946, p.\n13).\n\nWhen Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality”\nor “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a\nclaim to the intellectual audience by making *The Charterhouse of Parma*\nhis first title.\n\nIn 1999, fifty-six years after *The Charterhouse of Parma* was\ndiscontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by\nRichard Howard. That edition, in paperback, was in print as of 2016.\n\n",
