<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For those who want laughter, <em>The Best of S. J. Perelman</em> is just
[±exactly] what the doctor ordered. It is a cure for nearly
everything that ails a melancholy world. The knife of Perelman’s wit
and wisdom is sharpened on the boot of satire. The incomparable
parodist, he takes a cut at books, advertising, magazines, publishers,
the movies, columnists, socialites and even himself—and they are
[+all] the better for his keen scalpel and deft hand. Perelman is at
his best in this book of fifty [+hilarious] pieces, each one
warranted [+as a tonic to your sense of humor and guaranteed] to
keep you healthy with laughter. (<em>Spring 1947</em>) [<em>Spring 1957</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1944, as <em>Crazy Like a Fox</em>. ML
edition (pp. 3–269) printed from RH plates with minor revisions
suggested by Perelman, running heads omitted, dedication to Robert C.
Benchley added, and the table of contents reset in the style of the
Random House edition to reflect the addition of the introduction and
four stories on pp. 270–300. Page numerals (vii–viii) were added to the
reset table of contents. Publication announced for January 1947. <em>WR</em> 10
May 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.
Reprinted (pp. [v]–xiv, 3–300) in Vintage Books, May 1973, using
offset lithographic plates photographically reduced from the ML edition,
with title, half title, and fly title reverting to <em>Crazy Like a Fox</em>.</p>
<p>The ML paid Perelman royalties of 10 cents a copy, double the rate
specified for a ML reprint in the Random House contract (Perelman to
Cerf, 22 September 1946). Perelman wrote a new introduction for the ML
edition under the name “Sidney Namlerep” and sent four additional
pieces: “Physician, Steel Thyself,” “Pale Hands I Loathe,” “Insert Flap
‘A’ and Throw Away,” and “Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer.” He hoped that
the additional pieces could be inserted within the text rather than
added at the end but recognized that that might not be possible since
<em>Crazy Like a Fox</em> plates were being used. He also asked to change the
dedication from “For Laura and Abby Laura” (his wife and daughter) to
“To Robert C. Benchley” (Perelman to Klopfer, 2 December 1946). The
dedication in the Random House edition was printed on the verso of the
title page; the dedication to Benchley in the Modern Library edition
appeared on a leaf of its own.</p>
<p>Perelman suggested McKnight Kauffer as the jacket designer for the ML
edition. Five years earlier, after meeting with Saxe Commins in
connection with his forthcoming book <em>The Dream Department</em> (Random
House, 1943), he commented, “On the way out after leaving you, I looked
at some of McKnight Kauffer’s jackets for Modern Library titles. He’s
wonderful; I really would love to have him do a jacket for the book if
it could be arranged” (Perelman to Commins, “Tuesday” [6 October
1942]). Kauffer designed the jackets for <em>The Dream Department</em> and the
Random House trade edition of <em>Crazy Like a Fox</em> as well as the jacket
for the ML edition.</p>
<p>Perelman also emphasized that it was important to proofread <em>Crazy Like
a Fox</em> carefully, and he asked for several changes in the text, of which
the most notable was changing “total recall” to “O’Hara’s disease” (p.
53). Other changes included changing “rif ling” to “riffling” (p. 47),
“jack boots” to “jackboots” (p. 88), and “compound fracture” to
“greenstick fracture” (p. 184).</p>
<p>Negotiations concerning the publication of <em>The Best of S. J. Perelman</em>
between Cerf and Perelman’s agent, Alan Collins of Curtis Brown, Ltd.,
were not harmonious. Prior to publication Cerf wrote Collins: “I would
like to state here very clearly that we will carry out our contract for
the Perelman anthology in the Modern Library and that, thereafter, we
have not the faintest interest in future writings by Mr. Perelman” (Cerf
to Collins, 18 November 1946).</p>
<p>Random House published five books by Perelman between 1937 and 1946. His
next book was published by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock; thereafter he settled
into a long-term publishing relationship with Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>
