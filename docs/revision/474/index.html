<p>“Were I to be marooned on a desert island with just one book, I would

(<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Coward-McCann, 1945. ML edition (pp. [vii]–x,
xxvii–515**)** printed from Coward-McCann plates with “Last Word First”
(pp. xi–xxvi) added and table of contents and introduction repaginated.
Published June 1955. <em>WR</em> 25 June 1955. First printing: 5,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1959.</p>
<p>The ML paid Coward-McCann a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents
a copy. Publishers were not enthusiastic about McCord’s title. An
earlier reprint changed the title to <em>The Modern Treasury of Humorous
Verse</em> (Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition
under its subtitle, <em>An Anthology of American and British Humorous and
Witty Verse</em> with <em>What Cheer</em> as a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16
July 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave
five years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he
wrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . . <em>What Cheer</em> is short and
sweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I
wanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I
think, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship
(the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on
to the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954).</p>
<p>McCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he
suggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of
people, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could
not be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if
he really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as
well without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included
the new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.”
Permission fees for the new verses came to $220.50; the costs for
typesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new
to the ML edition were $264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955).</p>
<p>Fifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t
setting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it
has justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am
proud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three
years later he had to tell McCord that <em>What Cheer</em> had “dropped so far
below our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the
series. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as
you know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this
kind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959).</p>

ML edition (pp. \\[vii\\]–x,\nxxvii–515**)** printed from Coward-McCann plates with “Last Word First”\n(pp. xi–xxvi) added and table of contents and introduction repaginated.\nPublished June 1955. *WR* 25 June 1955. First printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1959.\n\nThe ML paid Coward-McCann a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents\na copy. Publishers were not enthusiastic about McCord’s title. An\nearlier reprint changed the title to *The Modern Treasury of Humorous\nVerse* (Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition\nunder its subtitle, *An Anthology of American and British Humorous and\nWitty Verse* with *What Cheer* as a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16\nJuly 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave\nfive years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he\nwrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . . *What Cheer* is short and\nsweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I\nwanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I\nthink, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship\n(the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on\nto the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954).\n\nMcCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he\nsuggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of\npeople, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could\nnot be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if\nhe really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as\nwell without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included\nthe new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.”\nPermission fees for the new verses came to $220.50; the costs for\ntypesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new\nto the ML edition were $264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955).\n\nFifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t\nsetting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it\nhas justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am\nproud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three\nyears later he had to tell McCord that *What Cheer* had “dropped so far\nbelow our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the\nseries. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as\nyou know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this\nkind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959).",
