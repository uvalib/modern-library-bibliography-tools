<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig Lewisohn’s</span> “Up Stream” appeared
first in the Spring of 1922. The color and charm of the book and the
continuous beauty of its prose established it immediately as an
important and permanent contribution to American letters. The Modern
Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and
certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly
win a tremendous new audience for the book. (<em>Fall 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1922. The B&amp;L plates were too
large for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a
new typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.
<em>WR</em> 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1
January 1940.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Up Stream</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th
out of 147 ML titles.</p>
<p>Klopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New
York, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an
introduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like
to have your name among the people who have written introductions to our
volumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had
not liked <em>Up Stream</em> but would be willing to write an introduction to a
ML edition of Lewisohn’s <em>Israel</em> (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).
In the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.</p>
<p>Lewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He
informed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral
and literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not
too extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book
in such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to
Klopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his
marriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He
removed a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote
others. In the B&amp;L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his
fourth story to <em>Uncle Remus’s Magazine</em> for $125, Lewisohn wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.
My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and
I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in
Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows
Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the
dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&amp;L, p. 135; suspension
points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&amp;L and ML
texts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.
Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor
and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was
sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be
less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions
within me. . . .</p>
<p>We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I
think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I
tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her
family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to
be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was
perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was
absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor
true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a
middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older
than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .
Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under
. . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are
the following, with the page of the 1922 Boni &amp; Liveright edition given
first, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library
printing: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;
146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;
188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.</p>
<p>When Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of <em>Up Stream</em> she threatened
to sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:
“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor
and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked
Lewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for
including the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful
nuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will
all have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very
earliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).</p>

(*Fall 1925*)\n\n*Jacket:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.\n\n> Text on front:<br>\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">Ludwig Lewisohn’s</span> “Up Stream” appeared\n> first in the Spring of 1922. The color and charm of the book and the\n> continuous beauty of its prose established it immediately as an\n> important and permanent contribution to American letters. The Modern\n> Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and\n> certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly\n> win a tremendous new audience for the book. (*Fall 1926*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.\n*WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1940.\n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th\nout of 147 ML titles.\n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New\nYork, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an\nintroduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like\nto have your name among the people who have written introductions to our\nvolumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had\nnot liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a\nML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).\nIn the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.\n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He\ninformed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral\nand literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not\ntoo extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book\nin such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to\nKlopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his\nmarriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He\nremoved a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote\nothers. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his\nfourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for $125, Lewisohn wrote:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and\n> I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in\n> Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows\n> Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the\n> dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension\n> points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML\n> texts).\n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\n> and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was\n> sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be\n> less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions\n> within me. . . .\n>\n> We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I\n> think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I\n> tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her\n> family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to\n> be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was\n> perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was\n> absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor\n> true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a\n> middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older\n> than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .\n> Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under\n> . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)\n\nA complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are\nthe following, with the page of the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition given\nfirst, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library\nprinting: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;\n146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;\n188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.\n\nWhen Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of *Up Stream* she threatened\nto sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:\n“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\nand her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked\nLewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for\nincluding the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful\nnuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will\nall have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very\nearliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).\n\n",
