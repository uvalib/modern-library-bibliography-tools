(<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<p><em>Format: The Cabala</em> was the first ML title published in balloon cloth
binding B. Copies with the statement “First Modern Library Edition |
1929” have been seen with the Bernhard endpaper, which was used through
March 1929, the month in which the first printing was probably made, and
also the Kent endpaper, which began to be used in April, the month in
which <em>The Cabala</em> was published. The earliest copies sold were almost
certainly those in the Bernhard endpaper. Copies examined in jacket B
have the Kent endpaper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> Pagination as 175 except: [231–242].
[1–8]<sup>16</sup>. Contents as 175 except: [ii] <em>First</em> statement
omitted; [231–235] ML list; [236–242] blank. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The first
popular priced edition of the book that won for Thornton Wilder
overnight a position among America’s leading writers.” (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in black on strong yellowish pink (26) paper with
inset illustration of two women and two men seated around a table,
casting shadows on an exotically decorated wall; lettering in black.
Signed: N.B. (<em>Spring 1929</em>) <em>Note:</em> At this period the ML was making a
limited number of titles available in pictorial jackets as an
alternative to the uniform typographic jacket. Jackets A and B were
superseded by jacket C in fall 1931.</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in grayish purple (228) and black on light
purplish gray paper with inset illustration as jacket B; lettering in
black, borders in grayish purple. (<em>Fall 1931</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The sensational success of <em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</em> obscured for a
time the fine lustre of Thornton Wilder’s earlier work, <em>The Cabala</em>.
But critics and an enthusiastic minority of readers clung to their
preference for the calm and suave classicism of the Italian tale in
the Henry James tradition. The restraint and the mystical implications
of <em>The Cabala</em>, the imaginative subtlety with which it is endowed,
the firmness of its characterizations, its wit and irony, give it a
place of eminence among contemporary novels. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Albert &amp; Charles Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp.
[iii], [3]–230) printed from Boni plates. The heading of the
contents page of Boni printings was changed from <em>The Cabala</em> to
<em>Contents</em> at some point between the sixth printing (January 1928) and
the tenth printing (August 1928); ML printings use the second version of
the contents page. Published April 1929. <em>WR</em> 11 May 1929. First
printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1937.</p>
<p>Cerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know
that you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote,
“particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an
introduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to
send it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is
going to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford
to buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be
made up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words
stating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in
this edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double
the ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the
last moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an
introduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March
1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the
end of March.</p>
<p><em>The Cabala</em> sold well during its first two or three years in the
series. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and
another printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in
the RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933.</p>

Copies with the statement “First Modern Library Edition |\n1929” have been seen with the Bernhard endpaper, which was used through\nMarch 1929, the month in which the first printing was probably made, and\nalso the Kent endpaper, which began to be used in April, the month in\nwhich *The Cabala* was published. The earliest copies sold were almost\ncertainly those in the Bernhard endpaper. Copies examined in jacket B\nhave the Kent endpaper.\n\n> *Variant:* Pagination as 175 except: \\[231–242\\].\n> \\[1–8\\]<sup>16</sup>. Contents as 175 except: \\[ii\\] *First* statement\n> omitted; \\[231–235\\] ML list; \\[236–242\\] blank. (*Fall 1931*)\n\n*Jacket* *A:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The first\npopular priced edition of the book that won for Thornton Wilder\novernight a position among America’s leading writers.” (*Spring 1929*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in black on strong yellowish pink (26) paper with\ninset illustration of two women and two men seated around a table,\ncasting shadows on an exotically decorated wall; lettering in black.\nSigned: N.B. (*Spring 1929*) *Note:* At this period the ML was making a\nlimited number of titles available in pictorial jackets as an\nalternative to the uniform typographic jacket. Jackets A and B were\nsuperseded by jacket C in fall 1931.\n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in grayish purple (228) and black on light\npurplish gray paper with inset illustration as jacket B; lettering in\nblack, borders in grayish purple. (*Fall 1931*\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The sensational success of *The Bridge of San Luis Rey* obscured for a\n> time the fine lustre of Thornton Wilder’s earlier work, *The Cabala*.\n> But critics and an enthusiastic minority of readers clung to their\n> preference for the calm and suave classicism of the Italian tale in\n> the Henry James tradition. The restraint and the mystical implications\n> of *The Cabala*, the imaginative subtlety with which it is endowed,\n> the firmness of its characterizations, its wit and irony, give it a\n> place of eminence among contemporary novels. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Albert & Charles Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[iii\\], \\[3\\]–230) printed from Boni plates. The heading of the\ncontents page of Boni printings was changed from *The Cabala* to\n*Contents* at some point between the sixth printing (January 1928) and\nthe tenth printing (August 1928); ML printings use the second version of\nthe contents page. Published April 1929. *WR* 11 May 1929. First\nprinting: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1937.\n\nCerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know\nthat you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote,\n“particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an\nintroduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to\nsend it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is\ngoing to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford\nto buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be\nmade up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words\nstating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in\nthis edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double\nthe ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the\nlast moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an\nintroduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March\n1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the\nend of March.\n\n*The Cabala* sold well during its first two or three years in the\nseries. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and\nanother printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in\nthe RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933.",
