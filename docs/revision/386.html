<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the new generation of novelists, risen to prominence during the
Second World War, no one stands higher than John Hersey. In <em>A Bell
for Adano</em> he has given the first fictional, and so far the most
eloquent, American interpretation of the struggle of democracy against
fascism. He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all
their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed
it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially
written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his
faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world.
(<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp.
[1]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. <em>WR</em> 27
April 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.</p>
<p>The ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a
copy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in
1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf,
Inc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A
Pocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.</p>
<p>Hersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in
place of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar
rather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began:
“Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It
is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”</p>
<p>On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent
of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in
this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of
September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military
Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than
average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was
just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two
things.</p>
<p>One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus
one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication
to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of
peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .</p>
<p>The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was
a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our
citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the
military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter
how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never
forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men,
when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones,
when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute
control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn
on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every
other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative
talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever
to appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November
1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in
the Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not
“consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere
else” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf
edition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint
editions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more
than thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.</p>
<p>Copies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of
the volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and
jacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author
stamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and
title printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is
indicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used
on ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as
regular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for
the use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.</p>
<p>The ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Signed:\nVA \\[Valenti Angelo\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Of the new generation of novelists, risen to prominence during the\n> Second World War, no one stands higher than John Hersey. In *A Bell\n> for Adano* he has given the first fictional, and so far the most\n> eloquent, American interpretation of the struggle of democracy against\n> fascism. He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all\n> their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed\n> it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially\n> written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his\n> faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world.\n> (*Spring 1946*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp.\n\\[1\\]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. *WR* 27\nApril 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nThe ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a\ncopy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in\n1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf,\nInc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A\nPocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.\n\nHersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in\nplace of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar\nrather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:\n\n> For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began:\n> “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It\n> is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”\n>\n> On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent\n> of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in\n> this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of\n> September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military\n> Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than\n> average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was\n> just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two\n> things.\n>\n> One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus\n> one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication\n> to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of\n> peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .\n>\n> The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was\n> a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our\n> citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the\n> military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter\n> how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never\n> forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men,\n> when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones,\n> when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute\n> control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn\n> on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every\n> other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative\n> talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).\n\nCommins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever\nto appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November\n1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in\nthe Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not\n“consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere\nelse” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf\nedition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint\neditions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more\nthan thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.\n\nCopies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of\nthe volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and\njacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author\nstamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and\ntitle printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is\nindicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used\non ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as\nregular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for\nthe use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.\n\nThe ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.",
