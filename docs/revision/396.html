black on coated white paper with white panel at top containing title in
black with “ARISTOTLE” highlighted in deep orange yellow and
left-profile illustration of Aristotle at upper right; deep orange

series in deep orange yellow. Signed: RIKI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
To bring within the compass of a Modern Library volume the essence of
Aristotle’s thought is an achievement of which the editors are
pardonably proud. A book for students and general readers alike, this
volume provides in its almost 700 pages the Posterior Analytics
(Logic), De Anima (On the Soul), Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics,
complete and unabridged, as well as generous selections from Physics,
Metaphysics, and Politics. The interpretive introductions by Richard
McKeon are helpful guides through the ever-new world of Aristotle’s
ideas. (<em>Spring 1947</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A2:</em> As jacket A1 with the designer’s name omitted. (<em>Fall
1961</em>) <em>Note:</em> There are two versions of the jacket, one with the
designer’s name RIKI on the deep orange yellow panel, the other without
the designer’s name. The earliest noted without the designer’s name
dates from 1957. Some later printings of the jacket include the
designer’s name, others omit it.</p>
<p>Original ML collection drawn from <em>The Basic Works of Aristotle</em>, ed.
Richard McKeon (Random House, 1941). All of the translations were
originally published by Oxford University Press. Publication announced
for January 1947. <em>WR</em> 12 April 1947. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>McKeon edited the <em>Basic Works of Aristotle</em> without a contract and was
unhappy with the financial arrangements he was offered when it was
completed. He had undertaken the collection hoping that it could be
published as a ML Giant and was prepared to accept a flat fee of $500 if
it was published in an inexpensive format suitable for classroom use. “I
made it abundantly clear, in conversation,” he wrote later, “that in the
event that a larger price was to be charged for the volume, I would
consent to do it only on the basis of a continuing royalty payment”
(McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). He was informed after he submitted the
manuscript that it could not be published as a Giant, and Cerf rejected
the royalty rate he suggested (5 percent on the first 3,500 copies
rising to 12½ percent on sales over 10,000 copies). McKeon eventually
agreed to an arrangement that limited his earnings to $1,250 (McKeon to
Commins, ibid.).</p>
<p>When Cerf invited him to compile a shorter collection of Aristotle’s
writings for the ML, McKeon insisted on a contract before beginning
work. He wrote Cerf, “If you had asked me to do the small Aristotle
before the months of battling with Saxe [Commins] about the larger
Aristotle, I should probably have told you it couldn’t be done. After
that experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me,
therefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the
only thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would
seem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more
concretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you
propose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold
annual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945).
The terms of the contract have not been ascertained, but McKeon
described the royalty he received on sales of <em>Introduction to
Aristotle</em> as “meager” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947).</p>
<p><em>Introduction to Aristotle</em> established itself as a textbook and became
one of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period from
November 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,114 copies, making it the ML’s
third best-selling title and one of eight titles (including Giants) with
annual sales exceeding 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>When the ML edition was declared out of print McKeon sought a reversion
of rights so that <em>Introduction to Aristotle</em> could be published by the
University of Chicago Press. Random House agreed to his request,
overlooking the fact that the collection was still in print in the
paperbound series Modern Library College Editions. Klopfer admitted,
“Nobody thought of the Modern Library College Edition until we had
committed ourselves. . . . There wouldn’t have been a chance of
reverting any rights to you if we hadn’t overlooked the MLCE” (Klopfer
to Morris Philipson, University of Chicago Press, 2 October 1972). The
reversion was limited to hardcover rights.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago Press published its edition of <em>Introduction
to Aristotle</em> in 1973. Described as a “second edition, revised and
enlarged,” it included a new general introduction and new introductions
to each work. In addition to the contents of the ML edition, it included
<em>De Partibus Animalium</em> (On the Parts of Animals), Book I, Chapter 1,
and <em>Rhetorica</em> (Rhetoric), Book I, Chapters 1–4 and Book II, Chapters
18–22. The format was 3/16 inch taller than the 7½ inch format the ML
was then using. The volume was perfect bound rather than sewn, and it
was bound in thin paper-covered boards—technically a hardcover under the
terms of the contract, but for practical purposes as close as possible
to a paperback.</p>

(*Spring 1947*)\n\n*Jacket A2:* As jacket A1 with the designer’s name omitted. (*Fall\n1961*) *Note:* There are two versions of the jacket, one with the\ndesigner’s name RIKI on the deep orange yellow panel, the other without\nthe designer’s name. The earliest noted without the designer’s name\ndates from 1957. Some later printings of the jacket include the\ndesigner’s name, others omit it.\n\nOriginal ML collection drawn from *The Basic Works of Aristotle*, ed.\nRichard McKeon (Random House, 1941). All of the translations were\noriginally published by Oxford University Press. Publication announced\nfor January 1947. *WR* 12 April 1947. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nMcKeon edited the *Basic Works of Aristotle* without a contract and was\nunhappy with the financial arrangements he was offered when it was\ncompleted. He had undertaken the collection hoping that it could be\npublished as a ML Giant and was prepared to accept a flat fee of $500 if\nit was published in an inexpensive format suitable for classroom use. “I\nmade it abundantly clear, in conversation,” he wrote later, “that in the\nevent that a larger price was to be charged for the volume, I would\nconsent to do it only on the basis of a continuing royalty payment”\n(McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). He was informed after he submitted the\nmanuscript that it could not be published as a Giant, and Cerf rejected\nthe royalty rate he suggested (5 percent on the first 3,500 copies\nrising to 12½ percent on sales over 10,000 copies). McKeon eventually\nagreed to an arrangement that limited his earnings to $1,250 (McKeon to\nCommins, ibid.).\n\nWhen Cerf invited him to compile a shorter collection of Aristotle’s\nwritings for the ML, McKeon insisted on a contract before beginning\nwork. He wrote Cerf, “If you had asked me to do the small Aristotle\nbefore the months of battling with Saxe \\[Commins\\] about the larger\nAristotle, I should probably have told you it couldn’t be done. After\nthat experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me,\ntherefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the\nonly thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would\nseem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more\nconcretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you\npropose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold\nannual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945).\nThe terms of the contract have not been ascertained, but McKeon\ndescribed the royalty he received on sales of *Introduction to\nAristotle* as “meager” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947).\n\n*Introduction to Aristotle* established itself as a textbook and became\none of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period from\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,114 copies, making it the ML’s\nthird best-selling title and one of eight titles (including Giants) with\nannual sales exceeding 10,000 copies.\n\nWhen the ML edition was declared out of print McKeon sought a reversion\nof rights so that *Introduction to Aristotle* could be published by the\nUniversity of Chicago Press. Random House agreed to his request,\noverlooking the fact that the collection was still in print in the\npaperbound series Modern Library College Editions. Klopfer admitted,\n“Nobody thought of the Modern Library College Edition until we had\ncommitted ourselves. . . . There wouldn’t have been a chance of\nreverting any rights to you if we hadn’t overlooked the MLCE” (Klopfer\nto Morris Philipson, University of Chicago Press, 2 October 1972). The\nreversion was limited to hardcover rights.\n\nThe University of Chicago Press published its edition of *Introduction\nto Aristotle* in 1973. Described as a “second edition, revised and\nenlarged,” it included a new general introduction and new introductions\nto each work. In addition to the contents of the ML edition, it included\n*De Partibus Animalium* (On the Parts of Animals), Book I, Chapter 1,\nand *Rhetorica* (Rhetoric), Book I, Chapters 1–4 and Book II, Chapters\n18–22. The format was 3/16 inch taller than the 7½ inch format the ML\nwas then using. The volume was perfect bound rather than sewn, and it\nwas bound in thin paper-covered boards—technically a hardcover under the\nterms of the contract, but for practical purposes as close as possible\nto a paperback.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nAristotle, *Politics* (1943– ) 362\n\nAristotle, *Rhetoric; Poetics* (1954– ) 469",
