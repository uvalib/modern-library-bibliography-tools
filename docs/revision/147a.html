The contents of this volume were chosen by Bertrand Russell himself,
and he prefaces them with a new introduction written especially for
The Modern Library. Included are his two famous essays, “A Free Man’s
Worship” and “Mysticism and Logic”, printed in full; significant
chapters from “Education and the Good Life”; “Proposed Roads to
Freedom”; Why Men Fight” [<em>sic</em> omission of quotation mark before
title]; “The A B C of Relativity”, and much other material. (<em>Fall

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Upon the completion of his <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, in collaboration
with Dr. Whitehead, Bertrand Russell reached the conclusion that
little could be achieved by writings addressed exclusively to
specialists. Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of
life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness.
These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened
philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and
political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the
guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published October 1927. <em>WR</em> 22 October 1927.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Shortly after publication of <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> (119)
Cerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to
Bertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to
have declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife
to the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed
to select the contents and secure permissions from the original
publishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond
writing the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of
the editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell
matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction
to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last
Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him,
however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what
selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much
better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!”
(Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Komroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He
went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark
to [<em>sic</em>] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured.
The whole sceme [<em>sic</em>] was my idea in the first place and it would
have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little
volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so
much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything
could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam
[<em>sic</em>] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list
I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926).</p>

Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of\n> life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness.\n> These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened\n> philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and\n> political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the\n> guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1927. *WR* 22 October 1927.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nShortly after publication of *The Philosophy of William James* (119)\nCerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to\nBertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to\nhave declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife\nto the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed\nto select the contents and secure permissions from the original\npublishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond\nwriting the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of\nthe editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:\n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell\n> matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction\n> to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last\n> Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him,\n> however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what\n> selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much\n> better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!”\n> (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926)\n\nKomroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He\nwent on:\n\n> I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark\n> to \\[*sic*\\] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured.\n> The whole sceme \\[*sic*\\] was my idea in the first place and it would\n> have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little\n> volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so\n> much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything\n> could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam\n> \\[*sic*\\] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list\n> I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926).\n\n",
