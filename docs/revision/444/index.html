<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library, in response to
frequent suggestions from readers of the series, have sought a volume
containing the representative writings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
Now, thanks to the scholarly [-and perceptive] research of [+the
late] Donald A. Stauffer, [+who was] Chairman of the English
Department, Princeton University, [-who contributes a brilliant
introduction,] the best of Coleridge’s poetry, essays and criticism
are here collected and arranged for the delight of the student and
general reader. Included in this book of 636 pages are such favorite
poems as “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” “Kubla Khan,” many odes,
sonnets and hymns, as well as essays on Shakespeare, on philosophy,
morals and religion [+, and Stauffer’s brilliant and perceptive
Introduction]. (<em>Fall 1951; [±Fall 1956]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published fall 1951; initially published in
MLCE. <em>WR</em> 17 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Originally published 1951 in MLCE and later that year in the regular ML.
Stein initially approached Earl Leslie Griggs of New York University
about editing the volume, but Griggs declined on the grounds that he had
edited an edition of Coleridge for Ronald Press some years before (Stein
to Griggs, 12 July 1950). He then offered Stauffer $250 to prepare the
MLCE collection (Stein to Stauffer, 4 August 1950).</p>
<p>Commins told Stauffer before the book was published, “When the contract
was originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition of
SELECTED POETRY AND PROSE OF COLERIDGE, we could not foresee the
astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales
possibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some
sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have
had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series,
hoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer,
28 June 1951). Stauffer received an additional $100 when the regular ML
edition appeared.</p>
<p>The poetry was set from <em>The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge</em>, ed. E. T. Coleridge (Clarendon Press, 1912). <em>Biographia
Literaria</em>, included in its entirety, was set from the edition of J.
Shawcross (Clarendon Press, 1907). Coleridge’s critical essays, “Romeo
and Juliet” and “Hamlet, 1813,” were set from <em>Shakespearean Criticism</em>,
ed. T. M. Raysor (Harvard University Press, 1930). The remaining prose
was set from Coleridge’s <em>Complete Works</em>, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (7 vols.,
Harper &amp; Bros., 1853). MLCE printings acknowledged the Clarendon Press;
the acknowledgement did not appear in the regular ML edition, which
concerned Stein (RH box 783).</p>

(*Fall 1951; \\[±Fall 1956\\]*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1951; initially published in\nMLCE. *WR* 17 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.\n\nOriginally published 1951 in MLCE and later that year in the regular ML.\nStein initially approached Earl Leslie Griggs of New York University\nabout editing the volume, but Griggs declined on the grounds that he had\nedited an edition of Coleridge for Ronald Press some years before (Stein\nto Griggs, 12 July 1950). He then offered Stauffer $250 to prepare the\nMLCE collection (Stein to Stauffer, 4 August 1950).\n\nCommins told Stauffer before the book was published, “When the contract\nwas originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition of\nSELECTED POETRY AND PROSE OF COLERIDGE, we could not foresee the\nastronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales\npossibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some\nsort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have\nhad to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series,\nhoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer,\n28 June 1951). Stauffer received an additional $100 when the regular ML\nedition appeared.\n\nThe poetry was set from *The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor\nColeridge*, ed. E. T. Coleridge (Clarendon Press, 1912). *Biographia\nLiteraria*, included in its entirety, was set from the edition of J.\nShawcross (Clarendon Press, 1907). Coleridge’s critical essays, “Romeo\nand Juliet” and “Hamlet, 1813,” were set from *Shakespearean Criticism*,\ned. T. M. Raysor (Harvard University Press, 1930). The remaining prose\nwas set from Coleridge’s *Complete Works*, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (7 vols.,\nHarper & Bros., 1853). MLCE printings acknowledged the Clarendon Press;\nthe acknowledgement did not appear in the regular ML edition, which\nconcerned Stein (RH box 783).",
