<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For more than two thousand years, the <em>Rhetoric</em> and the <em>Poetics</em> of
Aristotle have enjoyed the zealous acclaim of some readers and endured
the hostile scrutiny of others. But, in any case, few words of
antiquity have had more constant influence in Western thought than
have these writings. It has long been the hope of the editors of the
Modern Library to include these works in complete form, and now
permission to use the distinguished Oxford translations by Roberts and
Bywater makes this book possible. To it, Professor Solmsen has
contributed a distinguished introduction and a body of helpful notes.
(<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 29 January 1955. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The Bywater translation of <em>Poetics</em> was originally published by the
Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1909; the Roberts translation of <em>Rhetoric</em>
was originally published by the Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1924. The ML
paid Clarendon Press a $300 advance on the first 10,000 copies and
royalties of 5 percent of the list price thereafter. Solmsen received a
flat fee of $300 for his work on the ML edition. Stein found Solmsen’s
English a bit clumsy and sent the introduction to Sidney Kaplan at the
University of Massachusetts for stylistic improvement and clarification.
Kaplan received $30 for this work.</p>
<p>“The selection from the notes to the Roberts and Bywater edition has
been made by Professor Solmsen, who has also made the emendations
enclosed by brackets” (p. [iv]).</p>

But, in any case, few words of\n> antiquity have had more constant influence in Western thought than\n> have these writings. It has long been the hope of the editors of the\n> Modern Library to include these works in complete form, and now\n> permission to use the distinguished Oxford translations by Roberts and\n> Bywater makes this book possible. To it, Professor Solmsen has\n> contributed a distinguished introduction and a body of helpful notes.\n> (*Fall 1954*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nfall 1954. *WR* 29 January 1955. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe Bywater translation of *Poetics* was originally published by the\nClarendon Press (Oxford) in 1909; the Roberts translation of *Rhetoric*\nwas originally published by the Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1924. The ML\npaid Clarendon Press a $300 advance on the first 10,000 copies and\nroyalties of 5 percent of the list price thereafter. Solmsen received a\nflat fee of $300 for his work on the ML edition. Stein found Solmsen’s\nEnglish a bit clumsy and sent the introduction to Sidney Kaplan at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts for stylistic improvement and clarification.\nKaplan received $30 for this work.\n\n“The selection from the notes to the Roberts and Bywater edition has\nbeen made by Professor Solmsen, who has also made the emendations\nenclosed by brackets” (p. \\[iv\\]).\n\n",
