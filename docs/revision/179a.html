<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The rogues’ gallery of scoundrels and lusty wenches that gave flavor
to <em>Roderick Random</em> and <em>Peregrine Pickle</em> is matched by as humorous
an array of delightful and cantankerous characters in <em>Humphry
Clinker</em>. Here, too, are the caustic turns of speech, the sardonic wit
and the acute powers of observation that have made Smollett’s books a
plunder house for English writers during almost two centuries. And
here, above all, is Smollett in a genial and mellow mood, but candid
and outspoken, with the healthy frankness of the eighteenth century.
(<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>

Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Cerf wanted to include a volume of Machen’s stories in the ML and
proposed the idea to him when he visited London in summer 1926. <em>The
Hill of Dreams</em> and <em>The House of Souls</em> were in the U.S. public domain,
but Machen, who badly needed the money a ML edition would bring, felt he
could approve the proposal only if Alfred A. Knopf, his American
publisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached
Knopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He
told Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an
introduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s
usual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf
to Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that <em>Humphry Clinker</em>, “the
work of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he
thought that <em>Roderick Random</em> was “more characteristically Smollett:
rough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin
with. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with
his order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April
1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he
wrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.</p>
<p><em>Humphry Clinker</em> ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank
among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month
period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

And\n> here, above all, is Smollett in a genial and mellow mood, but candid\n> and outspoken, with the healthy frankness of the eighteenth century.\n> (*Fall 1936*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nAugust 1929. *WR* 14 September 1929. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf wanted to include a volume of Machen’s stories in the ML and\nproposed the idea to him when he visited London in summer 1926. *The\nHill of Dreams* and *The House of Souls* were in the U.S. public domain,\nbut Machen, who badly needed the money a ML edition would bring, felt he\ncould approve the proposal only if Alfred A. Knopf, his American\npublisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached\nKnopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He\ntold Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an\nintroduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s\nusual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf\nto Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that *Humphry Clinker*, “the\nwork of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he\nthought that *Roderick Random* was “more characteristically Smollett:\nrough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin\nwith. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with\nhis order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April\n1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he\nwrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.\n\n*Humphry Clinker* ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank\namong the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month\nperiod, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n",
