<h1>319c</h1>
<h2>Keynes’s “Life of Izaak Walton” revised (1949)</h2>
<div class="md-block"><p>Title as 319b.</p>
<p>Pagination as 319a. [1–8]<sup>16</sup> [9]<sup>8</sup>
[10]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Contents as 319b except Keynes’s “Life of Izaak Walton” on pp. 3–13
revised and reset.</p>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>A:</em> As 319b. (<em>Spring 1949</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A in strong green (141) and black on coated white
paper with illustration in strong green; “COMPLEAT ANGLER” in black and
strong green, other lettering in black or strong green. Galdone’s
signature is replaced by curved green line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
All the quaint humor and serene philosophy, the lyrical moods and the
enormous fund of information on the angler’s art are here, complete
and unabridged, for the devotees of the rod and hook and line, and for
all other civilized readers. <em>The Compleat Angler</em>, now three hundred
years young, is still the fisherman’s guide and companion; it has been
through three centuries a source of joy and wisdom to contemplative
men. Izaak Walton’s classic is a book to be treasured by readers of
every age and inclination—fishermen and nonfishermen. It is the
compleat balm for troubled minds and a refuge of quiet in a noisy
world. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keynes’s “The Life of Izaak Walton” (pp. 3–13) was revised and reset in
1948. The printing with the spring 1949 jacket is probably the first
from the reset plates. The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s
mother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed
Keynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton,
survived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of
Stafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A
footnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter
from Arthur M. Coon of Cornell University in <em>The Times Literary
Supplement</em> (25 December 1937).</p>
<p>The fall 1952 printing of the jacket was the last in three colors. The
fall 1954 jacket in two colors (black and strong green) may have been a
response to rising costs of color printing or declining sales of <em>The</em>
<em>Compleat Angler</em>. The ML edition of <em>The Compleat Angler</em> was
discontinued at the end of 1957.</p>

Galdone’s\nsignature is replaced by curved green line.\n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br>\n> All the quaint humor and serene philosophy, the lyrical moods and the\n> enormous fund of information on the angler’s art are here, complete\n> and unabridged, for the devotees of the rod and hook and line, and for\n> all other civilized readers. *The Compleat Angler*, now three hundred\n> years young, is still the fisherman’s guide and companion; it has been\n> through three centuries a source of joy and wisdom to contemplative\n> men. Izaak Walton’s classic is a book to be treasured by readers of\n> every age and inclination—fishermen and nonfishermen. It is the\n> compleat balm for troubled minds and a refuge of quiet in a noisy\n> world. (*Fall 1954*)\n\nKeynes’s “The Life of Izaak Walton” (pp. 3–13) was revised and reset in\n1948. The printing with the spring 1949 jacket is probably the first\nfrom the reset plates. The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s\nmother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed\nKeynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton,\nsurvived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of\nStafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A\nfootnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter\nfrom Arthur M. Coon of Cornell University in *The Times Literary\nSupplement* (25 December 1937).\n\nThe fall 1952 printing of the jacket was the last in three colors. The\nfall 1954 jacket in two colors (black and strong green) may have been a\nresponse to rising costs of color printing or declining sales of *The*\n*Compleat Angler*. The ML edition of *The Compleat Angler* was\ndiscontinued at the end of 1957.",
