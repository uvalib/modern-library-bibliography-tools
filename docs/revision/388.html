THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | [rule]</p>
<p>Pp. [i–iv] v–xi [xii], 3–246. [1–8]<sup>16</sup></p>

<em>First</em> MODERN LIBRARY <em>Edition</em>, 1946; v–xi <em>CONTENTS</em>; [xii] blank;
3–240 text; 241–246 <em>Index of First Lines</em></p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in brilliant yellow (83), strong orange (50),
light grayish brown (60), and black on coated white paper with
multi-color illustration at lower right of a smiling author in an easy
chair with a portable typewriter resting on his outstretched legs and
sheets of typescript scattered on the floor; title in reverse and other
lettering in black on inset light grayish brown panel bordered in strong
orange, all against brilliant yellow background. Signed: PG [Paul
Galdone].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The temptation to describe a book by Ogden Nash in his own light-verse
style is quickly overcome by mere trial. The simple truth is that he
is inimitable. He is [+original, he is] funny and he is profound; he
is clever and he is surprisingly penetrating; there are always both
rhyme and reason in his sensible nonsense. For this Modern Library
edition, Ogden Nash has made his own selection of 165 of his most
representative poems, each one a gem of humor and light-hearted
wisdom. (<em>Spring 1946; [Fall 1956]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A in vivid red (71) instead of strong orange and
grayish brown (61) instead of light grayish brown. Front flap as jacket
A fall 1956. (<em>Spring 1963</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for April 1946. <em>WR</em> 17
August 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1968,
four years after Nash’s <em>Verses from 1929 On</em> (1964) was added to the
ML.</p>
<p>Cerf first inquired about a volume of Nash’s poems in 1943, remarking:
“We are veering more and more to the classics in the Modern Library, but
we have to put in an occasional modern volume to keep up appearances”
(Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 1 October 1943). At that
time Little, Brown did not want to authorize another reprint edition of
Nash’s poems. Garden City Publishing Co. was doing well with its
one-dollar reprint of <em>The Face Is Familiar: The Selected Verse of Ogden
Nash</em>, and <em>The Ogden Nash</em> <em>Pocket Book</em> was scheduled to appear as a
25-cent paperback early the following year (McIntyre to Cerf, 2 October
1943). The Garden City reprint, published in 1941, eventually went
through fifteen printings for a total of 172,500 copies; the Pocket
Books volume had nine printings through January 1946 for a total of
765,000 copies (Crandell, pp. 58–60, 76).</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy to Little, Brown &amp; Co. In 1957
Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown noted that the ML was still paying
royalties of 10 cents a copy although the retail price had been
increased several times (Thornhill to Klopfer, 17 September 1957).
Royalties appear to have been increased to 12 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash</em> sold 5,332 copies during the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML
and Giant titles.</p>

Signed: PG \\[Paul\nGaldone\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The temptation to describe a book by Ogden Nash in his own light-verse\n> style is quickly overcome by mere trial. The simple truth is that he\n> is inimitable. He is \\[+original, he is\\] funny and he is profound; he\n> is clever and he is surprisingly penetrating; there are always both\n> rhyme and reason in his sensible nonsense. For this Modern Library\n> edition, Ogden Nash has made his own selection of 165 of his most\n> representative poems, each one a gem of humor and light-hearted\n> wisdom. (*Spring 1946; \\[Fall 1956\\]*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A in vivid red (71) instead of strong orange and\ngrayish brown (61) instead of light grayish brown. Front flap as jacket\nA fall 1956. (*Spring 1963*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for April 1946. *WR* 17\nAugust 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1968,\nfour years after Nash’s *Verses from 1929 On* (1964) was added to the\nML.\n\nCerf first inquired about a volume of Nash’s poems in 1943, remarking:\n“We are veering more and more to the classics in the Modern Library, but\nwe have to put in an occasional modern volume to keep up appearances”\n(Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 1 October 1943). At that\ntime Little, Brown did not want to authorize another reprint edition of\nNash’s poems. Garden City Publishing Co. was doing well with its\none-dollar reprint of *The Face Is Familiar: The Selected Verse of Ogden\nNash*, and *The Ogden Nash* *Pocket Book* was scheduled to appear as a\n25-cent paperback early the following year (McIntyre to Cerf, 2 October\n1943). The Garden City reprint, published in 1941, eventually went\nthrough fifteen printings for a total of 172,500 copies; the Pocket\nBooks volume had nine printings through January 1946 for a total of\n765,000 copies (Crandell, pp. 58–60, 76).\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy to Little, Brown & Co. In 1957\nArthur Thornhill of Little, Brown noted that the ML was still paying\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy although the retail price had been\nincreased several times (Thornhill to Klopfer, 17 September 1957).\nRoyalties appear to have been increased to 12 cents a copy.\n\n*The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash* sold 5,332 copies during the 12-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML\nand Giant titles.\n\n***Fall***",
