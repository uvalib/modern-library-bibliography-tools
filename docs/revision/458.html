1953; [1] part title: <em>Candida</em> | 1895; [2] blank; 3–473 text;

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library sought to include in
the series a representative collection of plays by Bernard Shaw. Until
now all their efforts were in vain because the author was adamant in
his determination that no selection from his works could be issued
during his lifetime in a reprint series. Finally, by special
arrangement with Bernard Shaw’s American publishers (Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.)
and his estate, we are able to fulfill the twenty-five-year hope and
offer in a single volume four of the major plays, with the famous
prefaces complete and unabridged. An Introduction by Louis
Kronenberger matches the brilliance and perception of the Shavian
plays. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 24 October 1953. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Stein prepared a list of six of Shaw’s plays that he considered
desirable for a ML collection: <em>Arms and the Man</em>, <em>Candida</em>, <em>Major
Barbara</em>, <em>Pygmalion</em>, <em>Heartbreak House</em>, and <em>Saint Joan</em>. The only
important play omitted, he told Cerf, was <em>Man and Superman</em> which had a
very long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final
selection, including the addition of <em>Caesar and Cleopatra</em>, was
probably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction
(Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953).</p>
<p>It was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure
permission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight
control over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of
his plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his
opposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a
million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies
each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to
publish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s, <em>Four Plays</em> and <em>Saint
Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion</em> (1956: 484). The only other
volume by Shaw in the ML was his early novel <em>An Unsocial Socialist</em>
(15), published in the series in fall 1917. Originally published in
1887, four years before the United States extended the possibility of
U.S. copyright to works by foreign authors, it was in the U.S. public
domain.</p>
