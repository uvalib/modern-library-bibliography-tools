<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
One evening, in the year 1546, Giorgio Vasari, a Florentine painter
and architect, was dining in Rome with the celebrated Cardinal
Farnese. The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need
was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of
Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should
undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”</p>
<p>Four years later <em>Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and
Architects</em> was published in Florence. The time and the man had come
together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a
great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian
Renaissance.</p>
<p>Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of
the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as
the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything
considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (<em>Fall
1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London
by the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959. <em>WR</em>
19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Linscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He
originally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs.
Jonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the
DeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser
translation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000
words.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the
manuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s
worth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates”
(Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume
DeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the
U.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of
pictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable
moralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential
Vasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to
change the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has
been done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a
building it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American
readers” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).</p>
<p>Linscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he
thought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to
Cerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and
an expensive illustrated edition by S &amp; S [Simon and Schuster] with
disgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print.
Instead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff,
inaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly
accurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).</p>

The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need\n> was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of\n> Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should\n> undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”\n>\n> Four years later *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and\n> Architects* was published in Florence. The time and the man had come\n> together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a\n> great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian\n> Renaissance.\n>\n> Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of\n> the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as\n> the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything\n> considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (*Fall\n> 1959*)\n\nML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London\nby the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959. *WR*\n19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nLinscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He\noriginally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs.\nJonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the\nDeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser\ntranslation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000\nwords.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the\nmanuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s\nworth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates”\n(Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume\nDeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the\nU.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of\npictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable\nmoralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential\nVasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to\nchange the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has\nbeen done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a\nbuilding it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American\nreaders” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).\n\nLinscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he\nthought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to\nCerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and\nan expensive illustrated edition by S & S \\[Simon and Schuster\\] with\ndisgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print.\nInstead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff,\ninaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly\naccurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).",
