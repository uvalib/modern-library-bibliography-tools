<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Nowhere is the brilliant, brittle world of Restoration England more
faithfully mirrored than in the dramas of that period. In this new
volume—for the same enjoyment now that others found then—are the best
plays of those colorful years. Here are not only the deeply moving
tragedies of Dryden and Otway, but, more importantly perhaps, the
ageless comedies of Etherege, Congreve, Wycherley and
Vanbrugh—comedies that captured the fine manners, the shimmering wit
and the constant intrigue of the gay aristocratic gallants and their
ladies. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1953.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Harris received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and
selecting the plays. Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven
plays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid
all but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact
upon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read
and enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to
Harris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and
recommended omitting <em>The Beaux’ Stratagem</em> if only six could be
published. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to
add <em>The Rehearsal</em> (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the
number of pages required and agreed to its inclusion.</p>
<p><em>Restoration Plays</em> and <em>Eighteenth-Century Plays</em> (1952: 448) were
conceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected
the plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using
the first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe
that a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to
Harris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to
set <em>Restoration Plays</em> from first editions of all of the plays except
<em>The Rehearsal</em>, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition
(Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured
photostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A
textual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for
<em>Eighteenth-Century Plays</em> appears on p. [iv] of <em>Restoration Plays</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first
editions. The sole exception is <em>The Rehearsal</em>, which is based upon
the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that
edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author.</p>
<p>A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early
editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in
spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small
number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The
volume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was
twice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the
regular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary
to Harris, 5 May 1953).</p>

In this new\n> volume—for the same enjoyment now that others found then—are the best\n> plays of those colorful years. Here are not only the deeply moving\n> tragedies of Dryden and Otway, but, more importantly perhaps, the\n> ageless comedies of Etherege, Congreve, Wycherley and\n> Vanbrugh—comedies that captured the fine manners, the shimmering wit\n> and the constant intrigue of the gay aristocratic gallants and their\n> ladies. (*Spring 1953*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published fall 1953. *WR* 19 September 1953.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nHarris received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and\nselecting the plays. Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven\nplays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid\nall but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact\nupon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read\nand enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to\nHarris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and\nrecommended omitting *The Beaux’ Stratagem* if only six could be\npublished. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to\nadd *The Rehearsal* (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the\nnumber of pages required and agreed to its inclusion.\n\n*Restoration Plays* and *Eighteenth-Century Plays* (1952: 448) were\nconceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected\nthe plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using\nthe first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe\nthat a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to\nHarris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to\nset *Restoration Plays* from first editions of all of the plays except\n*The Rehearsal*, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition\n(Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured\nphotostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A\ntextual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for\n*Eighteenth-Century Plays* appears on p. \\[iv\\] of *Restoration Plays*:\n\n> The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first\n> editions. The sole exception is *The Rehearsal*, which is based upon\n> the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that\n> edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author.\n>\n> A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early\n> editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in\n> spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small\n> number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.\n\nHarris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The\nvolume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was\ntwice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the\nregular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary\nto Harris, 5 May 1953).",
