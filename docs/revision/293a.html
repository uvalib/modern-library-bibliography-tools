<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>The inclusion of <em>The Complete Works of Horace</em> in the Modern Library
series carries forward the policy of issuing the classic writers of
antiquity, as well as the best works of their successors, including
our own contemporaries, in editions that are notable for their
completeness and scholarship. This volume contains all the satires,
odes, epodes, epistles, hymns and the essay <em>The Art of Poetry</em>. The
translations were chosen for their fidelity and for their retention of
the gay and ebullient spirit of Quintus Horatius Flaccus. (<em>Spring
1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published June 1936. <em>WR</em> 27 June 1936. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Kraemer, a professor at New York University, proposed the Horace volume.
He asked for an advance of $100 and royalties at the standard sliding
scale for trade books of 10 to 15 percent (Kraemer to Cerf, 20 June
1935). Cerf agreed to the advance but indicated that the ML could only
pay royalties of 5 percent (Cerf to Kraemer, 25 June 1935). Kraemer
accepted these terms. <em>The Complete Works of Horace</em> reprinted 29 pages
from <em>Horace and English Verse</em> translated by Alexander Murison, which
was copyrighted by Longmans, Green &amp; Co. in the British Empire but not
in the United States. Cerf requested permission to use the material, but
Longmans, Green wanted a fee of twenty guineas. This was more than Cerf
was prepared to pay, so the ML used the material without permission. He
told Longmans, Green that the ML would confine distribution to the
United States and Canada. Longmans, Green asked its Canadian office to
stop imports into Canada. T. F. Pike of the Longmans, Green Toronto
office wrote to Hugh Eayrs of the Macmillan Co. of Canada, the ML’s
Canadian distributors, so that he could “advise London my duty has been
done” (Pike to Eayrs, 30 November 1936). Eayrs passed his letter along
to Cerf.</p>
<p><em>The Complete Works of Horace</em> sold 2,730 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 44,171 copies by spring 1958.</p>

This volume contains all the satires,\n> odes, epodes, epistles, hymns and the essay *The Art of Poetry*. The\n> translations were chosen for their fidelity and for their retention of\n> the gay and ebullient spirit of Quintus Horatius Flaccus. (*Spring\n> 1936*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published June 1936. *WR* 27 June 1936. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nKraemer, a professor at New York University, proposed the Horace volume.\nHe asked for an advance of $100 and royalties at the standard sliding\nscale for trade books of 10 to 15 percent (Kraemer to Cerf, 20 June\n1935). Cerf agreed to the advance but indicated that the ML could only\npay royalties of 5 percent (Cerf to Kraemer, 25 June 1935). Kraemer\naccepted these terms. *The Complete Works of Horace* reprinted 29 pages\nfrom *Horace and English Verse* translated by Alexander Murison, which\nwas copyrighted by Longmans, Green & Co. in the British Empire but not\nin the United States. Cerf requested permission to use the material, but\nLongmans, Green wanted a fee of twenty guineas. This was more than Cerf\nwas prepared to pay, so the ML used the material without permission. He\ntold Longmans, Green that the ML would confine distribution to the\nUnited States and Canada. Longmans, Green asked its Canadian office to\nstop imports into Canada. T. F. Pike of the Longmans, Green Toronto\noffice wrote to Hugh Eayrs of the Macmillan Co. of Canada, the ML’s\nCanadian distributors, so that he could “advise London my duty has been\ndone” (Pike to Eayrs, 30 November 1936). Eayrs passed his letter along\nto Cerf.\n\n*The Complete Works of Horace* sold 2,730 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.
