<p>Chevalier’s introduction was written for the Smith and Haas edition. Its
rhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the
1950s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary
impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks,
no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is
burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading,
working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand
channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more
vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .</p>
<p>There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty
of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of
history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being
threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the
moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify
himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to
clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3)</p>
<p>Those of us who demand this can now point to <em>Man’s Fate</em> and say:
‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer
hearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it
was made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the
hearings.</p>

(*Fall 1960*)\n\nChevalier’s introduction was written for the Smith and Haas edition. Its\nrhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the\n1950s:\n\n> In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary\n> impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks,\n> no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is\n> burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading,\n> working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand\n> channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more\n> vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .\n>\n> There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty\n> of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of\n> history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being\n> threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the\n> moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify\n> himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to\n> clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3)\n>\n> Those of us who demand this can now point to *Man’s Fate* and say:\n> ‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).\n\nChevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer\nhearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it\nwas made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the\nhearings.\n\n",
