<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
These are the stories that John O’Hara likes best. Each of them
reflects his unique insight into the complex, aimless, frustrated
lives of his characters—the smart, the savage, the disillusioned, the
bitter, the ordinary. Varied in mood, time and place, these stories
show with an over-riding compassion the pathos and humor of men and
women when seen with a sharp eye and heard with a keen ear.</p>
<p>Readers already familiar with some of O’Hara’s writings—<em>Appointment
in Samarra</em>, <em>Ten North Frederick</em>, <em>A Rage to Live</em>, <em>Pal Joey</em>, the
stories in <em>The New Yorker</em>, and others—can look forward to reading
and re-reading in this book thirty-two of the finest stories by one of
America’s most distinguished writers. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

with “John O’Hara” in brilliant violet and other lettering in reverse,

as follows: “This book offers thirty-two of the finest stories by one of
America’s most distinguished writers.” (<em>Fall 1967 format</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML collection. Published October 1956. <em>WR</em> 5 November 1956.
First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990.</p>
<p>O’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he
liked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: <em>The
Doctor’s Son and Other Stories</em> (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), <em>Files on
Parade</em> (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), <em>Pipe Night</em> (Duell, Sloan and Pearce,
1945) and <em>Hellbox</em> (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything
from <em>Pal Joey</em> (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out
with Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on
O’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the
32 stories in the ML collection were from <em>Pipe Night</em> and <em>Hellbox</em>.
O’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which
concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of them [the stories] were written in the twenty years from
1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for
<em>The New Yorker</em> than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my
characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously
hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to
call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing
to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick
of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in
Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well,
damn their eyes.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years
I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the
preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But
during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was
part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and
one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection,
Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, <em>O’Hara Concern</em>, p.
233).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended
deleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it
(Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955).
Cerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to
persuade him to tone down his language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your
Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself
as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but
important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time,
I promise never to mention the matter again.</p>
<p>I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out
of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence,
“The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even
last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE
TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not
think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected
Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment.
This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a
collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short
stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant
reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly
concerned even remembers?</p>
<p>I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in
or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just
hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and,
furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New
Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. [Harold] Ross, who was Editor of
the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead;
[Brendan] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand
times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the
good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are
slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.</p>
<p>I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands,
several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of
your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.</p>
<p>There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and
that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably
telephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf
immediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an
introduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).</p>
<p>There were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, <em>John
O’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography</em>, p. 216).</p>

Front flap with first paragraph as jacket A and second paragraph\nas follows: “This book offers thirty-two of the finest stories by one of\nAmerica’s most distinguished writers.” (*Fall 1967 format*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956.\nFirst printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990.\n\nO’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he\nliked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: *The\nDoctor’s Son and Other Stories* (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), *Files on\nParade* (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), *Pipe Night* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce,\n1945) and *Hellbox* (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything\nfrom *Pal Joey* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out\nwith Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on\nO’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the\n32 stories in the ML collection were from *Pipe Night* and *Hellbox*.\nO’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which\nconcluded:\n\n> Most of them \\[the stories\\] were written in the twenty years from\n> 1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for\n> *The New Yorker* than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my\n> characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously\n> hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to\n> call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing\n> to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick\n> of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in\n> Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well,\n> damn their eyes.\n>\n> I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years\n> I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the\n> preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But\n> during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was\n> part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and\n> one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection,\n> Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, *O’Hara Concern*, p.\n> 233).\n\nThe foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended\ndeleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it\n(Weil, Gotshal & Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955).\nCerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to\npersuade him to tone down his language:\n\n> Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your\n> Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself\n> as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but\n> important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time,\n> I promise never to mention the matter again.\n>\n> I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out\n> of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence,\n> “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even\n> last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE\n> TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not\n> think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected\n> Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment.\n> This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a\n> collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short\n> stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant\n> reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly\n> concerned even remembers?\n>\n> I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in\n> or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just\n> hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and,\n> furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New\n> Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. \\[Harold\\] Ross, who was Editor of\n> the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead;\n> \\[Brendan\\] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand\n> times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the\n> good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are\n> slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.\n>\n> I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands,\n> several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of\n> your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.\n>\n> There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and\n> that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).\n\nThere is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably\ntelephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf\nimmediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an\nintroduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).\n\nThere were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, *John\nO’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography*, p. 216).\n\n",
