<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“Few books have had so unexpected success as <em>The Education of Henry
Adams</em>. Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one
hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author
declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He
bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical
Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first
published edition appeared. Although <em>The Education</em> had aroused a
deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one
of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great
popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best
sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant
works in American literature but among those which command a wide and
steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation,
the influence of the book is markedly increasing.” — from the
Introduction</p>

Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one\n> hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author\n> declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He\n> bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical\n> Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first\n> published edition appeared. Although *The Education* had aroused a\n> deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one\n> of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great\n> popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best\n> sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant\n> works in American literature but among those which command a wide and\n> steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation,\n> the influence of the book is markedly increasing.” — from the\n> Introduction",
