BY WILLIAM FAULKNER | COPYRIGHT, 1951, BY RANDOM HOUSE, INC. | <em>First</em>
MODERN LIBRARY <em>Edition</em> | 1951; v–xii INTRODUCTION | <em>By Harvey Breit</em>
dated p. xii: New York | January, 1951.; 7–378 text; [379–380]
CHRONOLOGY; [381–383] GENEALOGY; [384–385] map of Jefferson,
Yoknapatawpha Co., Mississippi; [386] blank; [387–392] ML list;
[393–394] ML Giants list. (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in strong blue (178), brilliant yellow (83), deep
brown (56) and black on coated white paper depicting a woman standing on
driveway to a mansion under a canopy of trees hanging with Spanish moss;
lettering in reverse and brilliant yellow. Signed: PG (Paul Galdone).
The ML jacket echoes George Salter’s jacket for the 1936 RH edition,
which “creates an eerie view of a house through foreground foliage”
(Hansen, p. 96), but is perhaps more effective in attracting prospective
buyers to the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The editors of the Modern Library, responsive to the growing demand
that as many titles as possible of the works of William Faulkner be
constantly available, are proud to add <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> to the
series. Originally published in 1936 and long out of print, this novel
has commanded huge prices in the rare book market, but is now brought
within the means of every book buyer. Considered by every critic one
of the major novels among the nineteen volumes written by the recent
Nobel Prize winner, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> stands with <em>Sanctuary</em>
(Modern Library No. 61), <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em>
(No. 187) and <em>Light in August</em> (No. 88) as a distinguished
achievement in the literature of the South and of the entire world.
(<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1936, with folding map tipped in
following p. 384. ML edition (pp. 7–[383]) printed from RH plates with
fly title leaf (pp. [5–6]) omitted, blank page before Chronology
omitted, page numerals (380–384) removed from Chronology and Genealogy,
and map redrawn to fit the ML’s format. Published spring 1951. <em>WR</em> 21
April 1951. First printing: 10,000 copies.</p>
<p><em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> was out of print in 1950 and very difficult to find.
Frances Steloff, proprietor of the Gotham Book Mart, wrote Cerf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is to serve notice that you will not have peace or rest until you
promise to reprint <em>Absalom, Absalom</em>. We have been advertising for
many months without receiving a single quotation. Now at last I get
the enclosed [a quotation from a dealer offering a copy at $74.25].</p>
<p>I called the guy up just to see if he was serious, and sure enough the
25¢ is for postage and insurance, he explains, rare books must be
insured. The last copy we sold for $20.00 and I thought we were
robbing the poor customer, but there is no other way to lay hands on
this title.</p>
<p>We have a poor student in Germany who made great sacrifices to get
$7.50 to us; about six months ago we thought we could supply one at
that price. And so we keep on searching without success. It is as you
must know the most important of all Faulkner titles, and Faulkner has
been on the up and up for the last two years.</p>
<p>Will you take my word for it that it will be the best selling title in
the Modern Library for a very long time. I had hoped to avoid annoying
you and thought I would extract a promise from Saxe [Commins] but he
passed the buck (Steloff to Cerf, [April 1950]; quoted in Morgan,
“Frances Steloff and the Gotham Book Mart,” pp. 741–42).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequent printings of 434a were as follows: two printings of 5,000
copies each (1952), 5,000 copies (1954), 5,000 copies (1956), 5,000
copies (1957), 7,000 copies (1959), two printings of 7,000 copies each
(1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each
(1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of
binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing
(there are no records of printings in 1953, 1955, and 1958) but the
total of 86,000 copies for the period 1951–62 is probably accurate
within 15,000 copies or so.</p>

(*Spring 1951*)\n\n*Jacket A:* Pictorial in strong blue (178), brilliant yellow (83), deep\nbrown (56) and black on coated white paper depicting a woman standing on\ndriveway to a mansion under a canopy of trees hanging with Spanish moss;\nlettering in reverse and brilliant yellow. Signed: PG (Paul Galdone).\nThe ML jacket echoes George Salter’s jacket for the 1936 RH edition,\nwhich “creates an eerie view of a house through foreground foliage”\n(Hansen, p. 96), but is perhaps more effective in attracting prospective\nbuyers to the book.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The editors of the Modern Library, responsive to the growing demand\n> that as many titles as possible of the works of William Faulkner be\n> constantly available, are proud to add *Absalom, Absalom!* to the\n> series. Originally published in 1936 and long out of print, this novel\n> has commanded huge prices in the rare book market, but is now brought\n> within the means of every book buyer. Considered by every critic one\n> of the major novels among the nineteen volumes written by the recent\n> Nobel Prize winner, *Absalom, Absalom!* stands with *Sanctuary*\n> (Modern Library No. 61), *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*\n> (No. 187) and *Light in August* (No. 88) as a distinguished\n> achievement in the literature of the South and of the entire world.\n> (*Spring 1951*)\n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1936, with folding map tipped in\nfollowing p. 384. ML edition (pp. 7–\\[383\\]) printed from RH plates with\nfly title leaf (pp. \\[5–6\\]) omitted, blank page before Chronology\nomitted, page numerals (380–384) removed from Chronology and Genealogy,\nand map redrawn to fit the ML’s format. Published spring 1951. *WR* 21\nApril 1951. First printing: 10,000 copies.\n\n*Absalom, Absalom!* was out of print in 1950 and very difficult to find.\nFrances Steloff, proprietor of the Gotham Book Mart, wrote Cerf:\n\n> This is to serve notice that you will not have peace or rest until you\n> promise to reprint *Absalom, Absalom*. We have been advertising for\n> many months without receiving a single quotation. Now at last I get\n> the enclosed \\[a quotation from a dealer offering a copy at $74.25\\].\n>\n> I called the guy up just to see if he was serious, and sure enough the\n> 25¢ is for postage and insurance, he explains, rare books must be\n> insured. The last copy we sold for $20.00 and I thought we were\n> robbing the poor customer, but there is no other way to lay hands on\n> this title.\n>\n> We have a poor student in Germany who made great sacrifices to get\n> $7.50 to us; about six months ago we thought we could supply one at\n> that price. And so we keep on searching without success. It is as you\n> must know the most important of all Faulkner titles, and Faulkner has\n> been on the up and up for the last two years.\n>\n> Will you take my word for it that it will be the best selling title in\n> the Modern Library for a very long time. I had hoped to avoid annoying\n> you and thought I would extract a promise from Saxe \\[Commins\\] but he\n> passed the buck (Steloff to Cerf, \\[April 1950\\]; quoted in Morgan,\n> “Frances Steloff and the Gotham Book Mart,” pp. 741–42).\n\nSubsequent printings of 434a were as follows: two printings of 5,000\ncopies each (1952), 5,000 copies (1954), 5,000 copies (1956), 5,000\ncopies (1957), 7,000 copies (1959), two printings of 7,000 copies each\n(1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each\n(1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of\nbinding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing\n(there are no records of printings in 1953, 1955, and 1958) but the\ntotal of 86,000 copies for the period 1951–62 is probably accurate\nwithin 15,000 copies or so.\n\n",
