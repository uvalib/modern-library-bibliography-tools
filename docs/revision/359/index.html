<p>Front flap:<br>
The three books which have provided spiritual solace for centuries are
here brought together in a single volume for a time when the entire
world is seeking comfort against the tragic impact of war. Here for
sustenance in a moment of trial are: Boethius, the sixth-century Roman
statesman who offers the consolatory gifts of philosophy; Thomas à
Kempis, fifteenth-century German mystic whose book of simple
devotional meditations has been an inspiration to Christians of all
denominations; Sir Thomas Browne the seventeenth-century English
physician whose faith was as sympathetic as it was imaginative.
(<em>Spring 1943</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published February 1943. <em>WR</em> 13 March 1943.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple
Classics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of <em>The
Imitation of Christ</em> is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M.
Dent, 1910). The text of <em>Religio Medici</em> probably derives from <em>The
Religio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne</em> (Everyman’s
Library, 1906).</p>
<p>Edman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for
his work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000
words that would include discussions of the three individual works. When
it arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind
of introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the
Modern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).</p>
<p>Cerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of
Boetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of
Chicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical
Library was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new
one (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).</p>
<p>J. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland,
noted that <em>Religio Medici</em> was on the Index and warned that its
inclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised
using a different translation of <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>. “If you
could use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a
Protestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this
would make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio
Medici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November
1942).</p>
<p>Eckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his
opinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the
fact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough
literate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point
of view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral
viewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman
to Commins, 11 November 1942).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943.</p>

Published February 1943. *WR* 13 March 1943.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple\nClassics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of *The\nImitation of Christ* is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M.\nDent, 1910). The text of *Religio Medici* probably derives from *The\nReligio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne* (Everyman’s\nLibrary, 1906).\n\nEdman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for\nhis work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000\nwords that would include discussions of the three individual works. When\nit arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind\nof introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the\nModern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).\n\nCerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of\nBoetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of\nChicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical\nLibrary was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new\none (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).\n\nJ. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland,\nnoted that *Religio Medici* was on the Index and warned that its\ninclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised\nusing a different translation of *The Imitation of Christ*. “If you\ncould use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a\nProtestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this\nwould make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio\nMedici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November\n1942).\n\nEckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his\nopinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the\nfact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough\nliterate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point\nof view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral\nviewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman\nto Commins, 11 November 1942).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943.",
