<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
With this volume one of the great masters of world literature is
published for the first time in the Modern Library. Long described as
the Jewish Mark Twain, Sholom Aleichem (as Alfred Kazin says in his
introduction to this book) “perhaps more than any other Jewish writer
who has ever lived, writes about Jewishness as if it were a gift, a
marvel, an unending theme of wonder and delight.” The vitality, the
laughter, the compassion in these stories are matchless. Peopled as
they are with such extraordinary characters as the lovable Tevye, the
dairyman, Menachem-Mendel, professional matchmaker, and a host of
others, they go beyond their faithful portrayal of the life of the
Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern Europe to represent, in a way
unequaled by any other writer, the Jewish soul. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published October 1956. <em>WR</em> 15 October 1956.
First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1973/74.</p>
<p>Kazin received $300 for the introduction. The collection includes of all
of the stories in <em>The Old Country</em>, translated by Julius and Frances
Butwin (Crown Publishers, 1946) and two stories, “On Account of a Hat,”
translated by Isaac Rosenfeld, and “The Pair,” translated by Shlomo
Katz, from <em>A Treasury of Yiddish Stories</em>, ed. Irving Howe and Eliezer
Greenberg (Viking Press, 1954). The glossary is also from <em>The Old
Country</em>.</p>

Long described as\n> the Jewish Mark Twain, Sholom Aleichem (as Alfred Kazin says in his\n> introduction to this book) “perhaps more than any other Jewish writer\n> who has ever lived, writes about Jewishness as if it were a gift, a\n> marvel, an unending theme of wonder and delight.” The vitality, the\n> laughter, the compassion in these stories are matchless. Peopled as\n> they are with such extraordinary characters as the lovable Tevye, the\n> dairyman, Menachem-Mendel, professional matchmaker, and a host of\n> others, they go beyond their faithful portrayal of the life of the\n> Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern Europe to represent, in a way\n> unequaled by any other writer, the Jewish soul. (*Fall 1956*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1956. *WR* 15 October 1956.\nFirst printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1973/74.\n\nKazin received $300 for the introduction. The collection includes of all\nof the stories in *The Old Country*, translated by Julius and Frances\nButwin (Crown Publishers, 1946) and two stories, “On Account of a Hat,”\ntranslated by Isaac Rosenfeld, and “The Pair,” translated by Shlomo\nKatz, from *A Treasury of Yiddish Stories*, ed. Irving Howe and Eliezer\nGreenberg (Viking Press, 1954). The glossary is also from *The Old\nCountry*.\n\n",
