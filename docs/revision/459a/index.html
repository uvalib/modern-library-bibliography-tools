<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The novel by which Robert Penn Warren compelled immediate national
attention and for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 has
already established itself as one of the notable books in all American
fiction. His story of Willie Stark, the power-impelled, back-country
demagogue, driven and corrupted by success, is a drama of many
strands. Interwoven among them all is the central figure of a rogue
strong and charming and ruthless enough to seduce either a close
friend or an unruly mob. For intensity of action, for an unfailing ear
for native colloquialism and for insight into the character and
motivations of a man drunk with the compulsion to power, there is no
comparable American novel. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1946. ML edition (pp.
[1]–464) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the
Harcourt, Brace edition with the dedication omitted from 459a. Published
1 September 1953. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1953. First printing: 7,500 copies.
Discontinued 1973/74.</p>
<p>The Harcourt, Brace plates were too large for the ML’s format. The ML
made its own set of offset plates from the Harcourt, Brace edition and
paid royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf thanked Edward Hodge of
Harcourt, Brace for a royalty concession that made it possible to
include the book in the ML at “a cost within reason” (Cerf to Hodge, 15
January 1953). The ML edition sold well despite competition from a
Bantam paperback. There were eighteen ML impressions between September
1953 and April 1971 for a total of 113,000 copies (Grimshaw, <em>Robert
Penn Warren: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1922–79</em>, p. 38; total number
of copies corrected by GBN).</p>
<p>Warren’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared as “A
Note to <em>All the King’s Men</em>” (<em>Sewanee Review</em> 61, Summer 1953, pp.
476–80) where it was identified as “An introduction to the forthcoming
Modern Library edition.”</p>

(*Fall 1953*)\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial on coated white paper with black-and-white\nphotograph of faces in a crowd at head and foot separated by wide black\nband with title in strong red (12), author and series in moderate blue\n(182), other lettering in reverse.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The novel by which Robert Penn Warren compelled immediate national\n> attention and for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 has\n> already established itself as one of the notable books in all American\n> fiction. His story of Willie Stark, the power-impelled, back-country\n> demagogue, driven and corrupted by success, is a drama of many\n> strands. Interwoven among them all is the central figure of a rogue\n> strong and charming and ruthless enough to seduce either a close\n> friend or an unruly mob. For intensity of action, for an unfailing ear\n> for native colloquialism and for insight into the character and\n> motivations of a man drunk with the compulsion to power, there is no\n> comparable American novel. (*Spring 1953*)\n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1946. ML edition (pp.\n\\[1\\]–464) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nHarcourt, Brace edition with the dedication omitted from 459a. Published\n1 September 1953. *WR* 19 September 1953. First printing: 7,500 copies.\nDiscontinued 1973/74.\n\nThe Harcourt, Brace plates were too large for the ML’s format. The ML\nmade its own set of offset plates from the Harcourt, Brace edition and\npaid royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf thanked Edward Hodge of\nHarcourt, Brace for a royalty concession that made it possible to\ninclude the book in the ML at “a cost within reason” (Cerf to Hodge, 15\nJanuary 1953). The ML edition sold well despite competition from a\nBantam paperback. There were eighteen ML impressions between September\n1953 and April 1971 for a total of 113,000 copies (Grimshaw, *Robert\nPenn Warren: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1922–79*, p. 38; total number\nof copies corrected by GBN).\n\nWarren’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared as “A\nNote to *All the King’s Men*” (*Sewanee Review* 61, Summer 1953, pp.\n476–80) where it was identified as “An introduction to the forthcoming\nModern Library edition.”\n\n**459b.
