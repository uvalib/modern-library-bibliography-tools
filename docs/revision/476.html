<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few figures hold a firmer place in the affections of their readers
than Oliver Goldsmith. The endearing qualities of his writings and of
the man himself are the same—the simple charm of the essays from <em>The
Citizen of the World</em>, the tenderness of <em>The Vicar of Wakefield</em>, the
compassion of <em>The Deserted Village</em> and other poems, the hilarity of
<em>She Stoops to Conquer</em>. An indifferent student in his youth, of law,
medicine, and pedagogy, he became an honor graduate of the school of
human weakness and suffering—for which the eighteenth century provided
ample classrooms. When he finally turned to literature, his
experiences were not expressed with the satirist’s biting ridicule but
with the genuine warmth, humanity, and humor which have made him a
beloved friend of generations of readers. (<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published June 1955. <em>WR</em> 25 June 1955. First
printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Stein initially asked Katherine C. Balderston of Wellesley College to
edit a Goldsmith volume for the ML, but she was too busy (Stein to
Balderston, 19 May 1952). Some months later he contacted Hilles, who had
written the introduction to <em>The Vicar of Wakefield</em> for the American
edition of Everyman’s Library in 1951 (Hilles to Stein, 23 February
1953). Hilles received a flat fee of $300 for his work on the volume.</p>
<p>“The text of the present edition . . . is based on the earliest version
of each selection. . . . Some of the additions which Goldsmith made at a
later date have been included, but these are set off within square
brackets. An attempt has been made to preserve the original spelling
with all its inconsistencies, but obvious misprints have been silently
corrected, and some of the long paragraphs in the early essays have been
split up. Considerable liberty has been taken with such quirks of the
printer as the use of italics, initial capital letters, and
punctuation.” (Editorial Note, p. xxiii)</p>

The endearing qualities of his writings and of\n> the man himself are the same—the simple charm of the essays from *The\n> Citizen of the World*, the tenderness of *The Vicar of Wakefield*, the\n> compassion of *The Deserted Village* and other poems, the hilarity of\n> *She Stoops to Conquer*. An indifferent student in his youth, of law,\n> medicine, and pedagogy, he became an honor graduate of the school of\n> human weakness and suffering—for which the eighteenth century provided\n> ample classrooms. When he finally turned to literature, his\n> experiences were not expressed with the satirist’s biting ridicule but\n> with the genuine warmth, humanity, and humor which have made him a\n> beloved friend of generations of readers. (*Spring 1955*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published June 1955. *WR* 25 June 1955. First\nprinting: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nStein initially asked Katherine C. Balderston of Wellesley College to\nedit a Goldsmith volume for the ML, but she was too busy (Stein to\nBalderston, 19 May 1952). Some months later he contacted Hilles, who had\nwritten the introduction to *The Vicar of Wakefield* for the American\nedition of Everyman’s Library in 1951 (Hilles to Stein, 23 February\n1953). Hilles received a flat fee of $300 for his work on the volume.\n\n“The text of the present edition . . . is based on the earliest version\nof each selection. . . . Some of the additions which Goldsmith made at a\nlater date have been included, but these are set off within square\nbrackets. An attempt has been made to preserve the original spelling\nwith all its inconsistencies, but obvious misprints have been silently\ncorrected, and some of the long paragraphs in the early essays have been\nsplit up. Considerable liberty has been taken with such quirks of the\nprinter as the use of italics, initial capital letters, and\npunctuation.” (Editorial Note, p. xxiii)\n\n***Fall***",
