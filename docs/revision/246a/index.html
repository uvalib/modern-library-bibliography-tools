<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
With one-sixth of the habitable world governed by Marxian doctrines
and with the rest of the world facing the possibility of a Communist
social order, the writings of Karl Marx become more a modern
revelation and prophecy than a mere economic interpretation of
history. His <em>Capital and Other Writings</em>, judiciously and
discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a
newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the
shelf of the Modern Library. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of <em>Capital</em>
and Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint
of <em>The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of
“Capital,”</em> edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L.
Trask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML
edition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until
October because of additions to the manuscript. <em>WR</em> 12 November 1932.
First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>The People’s Marx</em> does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S.
The ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L.
Trask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and
it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic
theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is
usually done” (p. xix). The selections from <em>The German Ideology</em> and
<em>Critique of Political Economy</em> in Part II were added by the ML.</p>
<p>Cerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was
prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was
compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy
encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of
Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932).
Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his
name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he
would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The
Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent
Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally
projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an
introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a
Russian magazine called <em>Education</em>. To this very orthodox statement by
Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark
made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something
complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this
theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must
advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p.
xix).</p>
<p>Shortly after the publication of <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and
Other Writings</em>, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of
Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and
edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was
cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested,
Declined” under 1933 for more information.</p>
<p>M. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack
of an index to <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings</em>:
“I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an
index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which
Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember
your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not
Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that
Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to
Schuster, 8 February 1933).</p>
<p>Sales figures from the 1930s are not available. <em>Capital, The Communist
Manifesto and Other Writings</em> sold 4,391 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and
Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952
with sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that <em>Capital, The
Communist Manifesto and Other Writings</em> had sold nearly 4,000 copies in
the past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).</p>
<p>The ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s
<em>Capital</em> (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854
copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333
copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952,
placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.</p>

Publication of the ML\nedition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until\nOctober because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S.\nThe ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L.\nTrask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and\nit seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic\ntheories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is\nusually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and\n*Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.\n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was\nprominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was\ncompiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy\nencyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of\nMarx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932).\nCerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his\nname may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he\nwould cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The\nLenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent\nParts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally\nprojected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an\nintroduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a\nRussian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by\nLenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark\nmade by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something\ncomplete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this\ntheory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must\nadvance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p.\nxix).\n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and\nOther Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of\nLenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and\nedit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was\ncancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested,\nDeclined” under 1933 for more information.\n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack\nof an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*:\n“I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an\nindex. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which\nKarl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember\nyour obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not\nGroucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that\nSchuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to\nSchuster, 8 February 1933).\n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist\nManifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952\nwith sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The\nCommunist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in\nthe past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).\n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s\n*Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333\ncopies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.\n\n",
