<p>Flap text rewritten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fielding himself described <em>Joseph</em> <em>Andrews</em> as a satire “in
imitation of the manner of Cervantes.” Its original purpose was to
heap ridicule on the then popular romantic heroine of Samuel
Richardson’s <em>Pamela</em>. But the novel grew beyond its first intention
and became more than a mere parody. In its own right it earned the
status of one of the major works of fiction of the mid-eighteenth
century and was the forerunner of Fielding’s masterpiece, <em>Tom Jones</em>
(Modern Library No. 185). Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on
the pretenses and follies of English society, <em>Joseph Andrews</em> is a
novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and
sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the
master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired.
(<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.</p>
<p>When <em>Joseph Andrews</em> was included on the first list of titles to be
published in MLCE, Stein offered Jones $75 to add a bibliography and
invited him to look over the introduction to see if he would like to
make any changes (Stein to Jones, 27 January 1950). Jones made only a
few small changes.</p>

(*Not seen*)\n\nFlap text rewritten:\n\n> Fielding himself described *Joseph* *Andrews* as a satire “in\n> imitation of the manner of Cervantes.” Its original purpose was to\n> heap ridicule on the then popular romantic heroine of Samuel\n> Richardson’s *Pamela*. But the novel grew beyond its first intention\n> and became more than a mere parody. In its own right it earned the\n> status of one of the major works of fiction of the mid-eighteenth\n> century and was the forerunner of Fielding’s masterpiece, *Tom Jones*\n> (Modern Library No. 185). Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on\n> the pretenses and follies of English society, *Joseph Andrews* is a\n> novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and\n> sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the\n> master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired.\n> (*Spring 1954*)\n\nPublished initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.\n\nWhen *Joseph Andrews* was included on the first list of titles to be\npublished in MLCE, Stein offered Jones $75 to add a bibliography and\ninvited him to look over the introduction to see if he would like to\nmake any changes (Stein to Jones, 27 January 1950). Jones made only a\nfew small changes.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nFielding, *History of Tom Jones* (1931–1971; 1985– ) 208; Giant\n(1940–1951) G52; Illustrated Modern Library (1943–1947) IML 5.",
