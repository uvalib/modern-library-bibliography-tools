<p>Front flap:<br>
For more than a quarter of a century Robert Frost has maintained a
position of unrivaled honor among living American poets. Associated
generally with New England, his works have transcended sectional
limitations and have become the lyrical voice of the entire land. Not
only has Robert Frost chosen 230 of his 270 published poems [±230 of
his poems for this collection], but he also contributes a personal
credo in the form of an Introductory Essay, “The Constant Symbol,” and
a new sonnet written especially for this volume. (<em>Fall 1946; [Spring
1955]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection published by arrangement with Henry Holt &amp; Co.
Published November 1946. <em>WR</em> 14 December 1946. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued spring 1963.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in
1940 (Cerf to Holt &amp; Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later
Robert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the
year, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated
that the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000
advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid
for and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write
an introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944).
It took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the
delay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan
conveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include
every poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of
Frost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and
Pocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). <em>The Pocket Book of
Robert Frost’s Poems</em> was published in 1946 and <em>The Complete Poems of
Robert Frost</em> (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern
Library contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500
advance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract
was for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless
terminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.</p>
<p>Linscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in <em>The
Collected Poems of Robert Frost</em> (Holt, 1939) and <em>A Witness Tree</em>
(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott
to Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided
that he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four
of the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had
left out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to
Mr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by
way of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but
instead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13
December 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four
poems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The
Mountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter
Night,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue
Ribbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking
with Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the
contents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only
“The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection.
Linscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages
(Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The
Constant Symbol,” was also published in <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> (October
1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost
appended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.</p>
<p><em>The Poems of Robert Frost</em> sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month
period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first
quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>
<p>No details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been
ascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt,
Rinehart &amp; Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in
1963.</p>

Not\n> only has Robert Frost chosen 230 of his 270 published poems \\[±230 of\n> his poems for this collection\\], but he also contributes a personal\n> credo in the form of an Introductory Essay, “The Constant Symbol,” and\n> a new sonnet written especially for this volume. (*Fall 1946; \\[Spring\n> 1955\\]*)\n\nOriginal ML collection published by arrangement with Henry Holt & Co.\nPublished November 1946. *WR* 14 December 1946. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued spring 1963.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in\n1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later\nRobert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the\nyear, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated\nthat the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000\nadvance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid\nfor and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write\nan introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944).\nIt took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the\ndelay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan\nconveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include\nevery poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of\nFrost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and\nPocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). *The Pocket Book of\nRobert Frost’s Poems* was published in 1946 and *The Complete Poems of\nRobert Frost* (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern\nLibrary contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500\nadvance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract\nwas for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless\nterminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.\n\nLinscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in *The\nCollected Poems of Robert Frost* (Holt, 1939) and *A Witness Tree*\n(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott\nto Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided\nthat he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four\nof the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had\nleft out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to\nMr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by\nway of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but\ninstead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13\nDecember 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four\npoems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The\nMountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter\nNight,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue\nRibbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking\nwith Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the\ncontents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only\n“The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection.\nLinscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages\n(Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The\nConstant Symbol,” was also published in *Atlantic Monthly* (October\n1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost\nappended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.\n\n*The Poems of Robert Frost* sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\nNo details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been\nascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt,\nRinehart & Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in\n1963.",
