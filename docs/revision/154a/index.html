<p><em>Jacket A</em>: Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Merejkowski’s trilogy of historical romances, collectively entitled
<em>Christ and Antichrist</em>, have been translated from the original
Russian into every European language. <em>The Death of the Gods</em> is the
first of the three, and has for its central figure Julian the
Apostate; <em>Leonardo</em> is the second; and the third is <em>Peter and
Alexis</em>, which is based on the tragic story of Peter the Great and his
son. Despite the fact that <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> has been heretofore
available only in very expensive editions in America, its popularity
has increased each year. Mr. Guerney’s new and complete translation
for the Modern Library brings within the reach of many new thousands
of readers the best biography of what was probably the most versatile
genius in all history. (<em>Fall 1927; spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial on light yellowish green (135) paper with inset
right profile drawing of Leonardo in black; lettering in black without

<em>Note:</em> Used on copies sold as part of Three Renaissance Romances gift
box, Christmas 1929.</p>
<p><em>Jacket E:</em> Pictorial in green and black on cream paper with drawing as
jacket B; lettering in black, borders in green. Signed: M.S. (<em>Spring
1931</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>F:</em> Typographic in grayish reddish brown (46) and black on
yellow paper with torchbearer omitted from front panel and title (THE |
ROMANCE OF | LEONARDO | DA VINCI) and borders in grayish reddish brown;
other lettering in black. (<em>Fall 1931</em>) Later printings in dark purplish
gray (234) with front flap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The insatiable spirit and the unparalleled genius of Leonardo Da
[<em>sic</em>] Vinci give radiance to this biographical romance. The heroic
grandeur of Leonardo’s achievements in art and science, the fecundity
of his mind and the illimitable reaches of his imagination are
revealed against the glowing background of the Renaissance. Kings and
popes and courtiers, artists and philosophers and poets throng the
scene. Dominating them all is Leonardo in a portrait that might have
been wrought by one of his own contemporaries. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML translation. Published 1 March 1928. <em>WR</em> 17 March 1928.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Publication was originally announced for November 1927 on the basis of
Guerney’s promise of a finished manuscript by the beginning of
September. The translation took longer than expected; the ML did not
receive final installment until 13 January 1928 (Cerf to Ronald
Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 14 January 1928).</p>
<p><em>The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em> sold 12,264 copies during the first
six months of 1928, making it the ML’s best-selling title. During the
18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML
titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November
1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold nearly 76,000 copies during its first five years
with annual sales as follows: 23,651 copies (1928); 20,933 copies
(1929); 14,447 copies (1930); 9,404 copies (1931); and 7,334 copies
(1932) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). It was the ML’s
best-selling title during the first half of 1928, with sales of 12,264
copies. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it sold
4,736 copies, placing it in the third quarter of ML sales.</p>

(*Fall 1934 jacket*)\n> *Note:* Translator’s notes restored.\n\n*Jacket A*: Uniform typographic jacket B2.\n\n> Text on front:<br>\n> Merejkowski’s trilogy of historical romances, collectively entitled\n> *Christ and Antichrist*, have been translated from the original\n> Russian into every European language. *The Death of the Gods* is the\n> first of the three, and has for its central figure Julian the\n> Apostate; *Leonardo* is the second; and the third is *Peter and\n> Alexis*, which is based on the tragic story of Peter the Great and his\n> son. Despite the fact that *Leonardo da Vinci* has been heretofore\n> available only in very expensive editions in America, its popularity\n> has increased each year. Mr. Guerney’s new and complete translation\n> for the Modern Library brings within the reach of many new thousands\n> of readers the best biography of what was probably the most versatile\n> genius in all history. (*Fall 1927; spring 1928*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial on light yellowish green (135) paper with inset\nright profile drawing of Leonardo in black; lettering in black without\nhorizontal borders and rules.

(*Fall 1931*) Later printings in dark purplish\ngray (234) with front flap:\n\n> The insatiable spirit and the unparalleled genius of Leonardo Da\n> \\[*sic*\\] Vinci give radiance to this biographical romance. The heroic\n> grandeur of Leonardo’s achievements in art and science, the fecundity\n> of his mind and the illimitable reaches of his imagination are\n> revealed against the glowing background of the Renaissance. Kings and\n> popes and courtiers, artists and philosophers and poets throng the\n> scene. Dominating them all is Leonardo in a portrait that might have\n> been wrought by one of his own contemporaries. (*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML translation. Published 1 March 1928. *WR* 17 March 1928.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nPublication was originally announced for November 1927 on the basis of\nGuerney’s promise of a finished manuscript by the beginning of\nSeptember. The translation took longer than expected; the ML did not\nreceive final installment until 13 January 1928 (Cerf to Ronald\nWilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 14 January 1928).\n\n*The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* sold 12,264 copies during the first\nsix months of 1928, making it the ML’s best-selling title. During the\n18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML\ntitles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\nThe ML edition sold nearly 76,000 copies during its first five years\nwith annual sales as follows: 23,651 copies (1928); 20,933 copies\n(1929); 14,447 copies (1930); 9,404 copies (1931); and 7,334 copies\n(1932) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). It was the ML’s\nbest-selling title during the first half of 1928, with sales of 12,264\ncopies. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it sold\n4,736 copies, placing it in the third quarter of ML sales.\n\n",
