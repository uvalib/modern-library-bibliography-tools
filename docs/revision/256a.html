<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The anthologist does not live who can compile a collection of short
stories and avoid loud protests for his omissions. In the field of the
German short story the choice is so wide that an inclusion of all
favorites would make a volume of encyclopedic bulk. This anthology
puts forth a comprehensive group of short novels and tales, selected
primarily because they are representative of the main currents of
German literature and those great national figures—Goethe, Schiller,
Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Zweig and others—who made it the
world’s heritage. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published April 1933. <em>WR</em> 29 April 1933. First
printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by <em>Great German Short Novels
and Stories</em>, ed. Victor Lange (451).</p>
<p>Thomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology
of German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February
1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed
responsibility for the anthology:</p>
<p>It was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a
considerable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He
expressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract
was duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still
roaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled.
At long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German
authors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with
the job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to
gather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and
exercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to
the publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the
wastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)</p>
<p>Hitler came to power shortly before <em>Great German Short Novels and
Stories</em> was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the
volume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf,
17 April 1933).</p>
<p>When <em>Great German Short Novels and Stories</em> was being planned Cerf
contacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s <em>Death in Venice</em>,
offering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a
Thomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been
published in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf
had published Kenneth Burke’s translation of <em>Death in Venice</em> as a
separate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T.
Lowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the
out-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against
royalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.</p>
<p><em>Great German Short Novels and Stories</em> sold 4,450 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of
the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

(*Spring 1933*)\n\n*Contents:* The Sorrows of Werther, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe;\ntranslated by Orson Falk – The Sport of Destiny, by Johann von Schiller;\ntranslated by Marian Klopfer – The History of Krakatuk, by Ernst T. W.\nHoffmann; translated by William Makepeace Thackeray – Hansel and Gretel,\nby Jacob Ludwig Grimm and Wilhelm Karl Grimm – Cinderella, by the\nBrothers Grimm – Gods in Exile, by Heinrich Heine; translated by M.\nFleishman – Immensee, by Theodor W.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The anthologist does not live who can compile a collection of short\n> stories and avoid loud protests for his omissions. In the field of the\n> German short story the choice is so wide that an inclusion of all\n> favorites would make a volume of encyclopedic bulk. This anthology\n> puts forth a comprehensive group of short novels and tales, selected\n> primarily because they are representative of the main currents of\n> German literature and those great national figures—Goethe, Schiller,\n> Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Zweig and others—who made it the\n> world’s heritage. (*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1933. *WR* 29 April 1933. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by *Great German Short Novels\nand Stories*, ed. Victor Lange (451).\n\nThomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology\nof German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February\n1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed\nresponsibility for the anthology:\n\nIt was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a\nconsiderable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He\nexpressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract\nwas duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still\nroaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled.\nAt long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German\nauthors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with\nthe job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to\ngather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and\nexercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to\nthe publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the\nwastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)\n\nHitler came to power shortly before *Great German Short Novels and\nStories* was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the\nvolume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf,\n17 April 1933).\n\nWhen *Great German Short Novels and Stories* was being planned Cerf\ncontacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s *Death in Venice*,\noffering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a\nThomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been\npublished in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf\nhad published Kenneth Burke’s translation of *Death in Venice* as a\nseparate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T.\nLowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the\nout-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against\nroyalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.\n\n*Great German Short Novels and Stories* sold 4,450 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of\nthe second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n",
