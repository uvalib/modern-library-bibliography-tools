<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Writing of <em>Human Being</em>, Edna Ferber said: “It is a glorious book, a
wise and deeply understanding book. It has a touch of God in it, and
the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading
public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its
heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act
of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, <em>Kitty
Foyle</em>, as well as those who have yet to experience their first
acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of
<em>Human Being</em>. (<em>Fall 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1932; rights
subsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>–<em>7</em>], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a
correction requested by Morley. Published October 1940. <em>WR</em> 12 October
1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.</p>
<p>The suggestion to include <em>Human Being</em> in the ML came from Morley
himself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little
to see myself represented in there only by <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em>; a
worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look
at it now.</p>
<p>I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in
<em>Human Being</em>, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in
retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get
a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the
Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person;
a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be
represented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I
don’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be
added; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley
backlist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern
Library” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted
that he had never read <em>Human Being</em> and asked Morley to send him a copy
(Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he
still thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general
interest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think
that a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was
able to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf
to Morley, 30 August 1939).</p>
<p>Morley’s novel <em>Kitty Foyle</em> was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett
and Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing
<em>Human Being</em> in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would
prefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf
agreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob [Haas] and I still think it
is a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and
the huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to
Morley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a $500 advance against
royalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition
corrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.</p>
<p><em>Human Being</em> sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML.
Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten
worst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that
category. <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em> (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was
the second worst-selling title.</p>
<p>There was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By
February 1944 sales of the ML edition of <em>Human Being</em> exceeded 6,000
copies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).</p>

Designed by Paul Galdone, June 1940;\nunsigned.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Writing of *Human Being*, Edna Ferber said: “It is a glorious book, a\n> wise and deeply understanding book. It has a touch of God in it, and\n> the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading\n> public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its\n> heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act\n> of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, *Kitty\n> Foyle*, as well as those who have yet to experience their first\n> acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of\n> *Human Being*. (*Fall 1940*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights\nsubsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*–*7*\\], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a\ncorrection requested by Morley. Published October 1940. *WR* 12 October\n1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.\n\nThe suggestion to include *Human Being* in the ML came from Morley\nhimself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):\n\n> Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little\n> to see myself represented in there only by *Parnassus on Wheels*; a\n> worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look\n> at it now.\n>\n> I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in\n> *Human Being*, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in\n> retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get\n> a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the\n> Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person;\n> a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.\n\nCerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be\nrepresented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I\ndon’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be\nadded; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley\nbacklist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted\nthat he had never read *Human Being* and asked Morley to send him a copy\n(Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he\nstill thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general\ninterest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think\nthat a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was\nable to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf\nto Morley, 30 August 1939).\n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett\nand Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing\n*Human Being* in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would\nprefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf\nagreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob \\[Haas\\] and I still think it\nis a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and\nthe huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to\nMorley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a $500 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition\ncorrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.\n\n*Human Being* sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML.\nMorley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten\nworst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that\ncategory. *Parnassus on Wheels* (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was\nthe second worst-selling title.\n\nThere was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By\nFebruary 1944 sales of the ML edition of *Human Being* exceeded 6,000\ncopies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMorley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (1931–1954) 213",
