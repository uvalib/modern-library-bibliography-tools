<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“The Cream of the Jest is in ground plan an attempt to lay bare the
secret soul of Felix Kennaston, a successful novelist—not the Bovaryan
pseudo-soul visible to his wife and his neighbors, but that esoteric
spirit which transcends time and space, and has its adventures in the
superworld of the imagination. Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and
reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile
Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the
whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s
desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of
much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating
reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It
would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A
thing obviously written <em>con amore</em> joyously without regard to
markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth
attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere
time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —<em>H.</em> <em>L. Mencken</em>.
(<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s
mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the
illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane
philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the
enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix
Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the
allegory of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> we discover something of what is
in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Robert M. McBride &amp; Co., 1917; new
bibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with
introduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions”
(Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. [v]–250), including
Ward’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride
typesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML
printings. Publication announced for January 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927.
First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> as early as July
1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s
<em>Jurgen</em> for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing
a “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not
want to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an
edition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition
never appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of <em>The Cream of the
Jest</em> the following year. <em>Jurgen</em> (271) was not included in the ML
until 1934.</p>
<p>The first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title
announced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of
the eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print
run. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state
“<em>Eighth Printing</em> | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | <em>1927</em>”.) This
might explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first
ML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131
variant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s
spring lists usually weren’t available as early as November.</p>
<p>In addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives
(which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in
August 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930,
and printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937,
for a total of at least 25,000 copies.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> during the first six months of 1928
placed it 33rd out of 147 ML titles.</p>
