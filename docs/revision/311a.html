<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in dark greenish blue (174), dark grayish yellow
(91), and black on coated white paper with title in reverse against
large dark greenish blue panel, borders at top and bottom in dark
greenish blue, other lettering in black against smaller white panels
ruled in dark grayish yellow; spine in dark grayish yellow with
lettering in black. Three-line statement on front panel: “<em>A New
Masterpiece</em>” | <em>The strange and disturbing drama of</em> | <em>two men and a
woman</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Genuine compassion for his vagabonds and human flotsam gives the
breath of life to John Steinbeck’s novels and makes them idylls of the
lower depths. <em>Of Mice and Men</em> is Steinbeck at his compassionate
best; it is a story movingly and forcefully told and with overtones of
soaring beauty. Its first success as a national best-seller and its
subsequent triumph in dramatic form have helped to place John
Steinbeck in the company of the first prose writers of America.
(<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Covici, Friede, 1937, and subsequently by Viking
Press. ML edition (pp. [5]–186) printed from Covici, Friede/Viking
plates. Published February 1938. <em>WR</em> 5 March 1938. First printing: Not
ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer arranged the ML reprint with Covici, Friede, which had
been Steinbeck’s publisher since the publication of his fourth novel,
<em>Tortilla Flat</em>, in 1935*.* The close working relationship between
Steinbeck and his editor Pascal Covici was comparable to those between
F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway with Maxwell Perkins at Charles
Scribner’s Sons. Covici, Friede failed shortly after <em>Of Mice and Men</em>
appeared in the ML. The firm was acquired by Viking Press, Covici became
a Viking editor, and Steinbeck became a Viking author. Arrangements for
the second ML printing were made with Viking Press in October 1938.</p>
<p>There were four ML printings between October 1938 and September 1942
totaling 10,000 copies. Steinbeck’s first book with Viking Press, <em>The
Grapes of Wrath</em>, sold 430,000 copies in less than a year and was the
best-selling work of fiction for 1939 (Madison, pp. 306–7; Hackett and
Burke, p. 127).</p>
<p>When <em>Of Mice and Men</em> was published in the ML it had to compete with a
39-cent reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books. Lewis Miller, the Random
House sales manager, told one of the sales representatives: “Bennett
felt strongly that the book deserved a place in the Modern Library, no
matter what other editions were to be had” (Miller to Rosengren, 24
January 1938).</p>
<p><em>Of Mice and Men</em> sold 7,020 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles. Sales of all four Steinbeck titles in the ML totaled 35,975
copies during this period. <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> was the only Steinbeck
novel among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Its first success as a national best-seller and its\n> subsequent triumph in dramatic form have helped to place John\n> Steinbeck in the company of the first prose writers of America.\n> (*Spring 1938*)\n\nOriginally published by Covici, Friede, 1937, and subsequently by Viking\nPress. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–186) printed from Covici, Friede/Viking\nplates. Published February 1938. *WR* 5 March 1938. First printing: Not\nascertained.\n\nCerf and Klopfer arranged the ML reprint with Covici, Friede, which had\nbeen Steinbeck’s publisher since the publication of his fourth novel,\n*Tortilla Flat*, in 1935*.* The close working relationship between\nSteinbeck and his editor Pascal Covici was comparable to those between\nF. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway with Maxwell Perkins at Charles\nScribner’s Sons. Covici, Friede failed shortly after *Of Mice and Men*\nappeared in the ML. The firm was acquired by Viking Press, Covici became\na Viking editor, and Steinbeck became a Viking author. Arrangements for\nthe second ML printing were made with Viking Press in October 1938.\n\nThere were four ML printings between October 1938 and September 1942\ntotaling 10,000 copies. Steinbeck’s first book with Viking Press, *The\nGrapes of Wrath*, sold 430,000 copies in less than a year and was the\nbest-selling work of fiction for 1939 (Madison, pp. 306–7; Hackett and\nBurke, p. 127).\n\nWhen *Of Mice and Men* was published in the ML it had to compete with a\n39-cent reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books. Lewis Miller, the Random\nHouse sales manager, told one of the sales representatives: “Bennett\nfelt strongly that the book deserved a place in the Modern Library, no\nmatter what other editions were to be had” (Miller to Rosengren, 24\nJanuary 1938).\n\n*Of Mice and Men* sold 7,020 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Sales of all four Steinbeck titles in the ML totaled 35,975\ncopies during this period. *The Grapes of Wrath* was the only Steinbeck\nnovel among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n",
