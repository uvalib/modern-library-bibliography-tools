<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
As more and more we look westward across the Pacific, the writings of
James A. Michener take on increased interest and importance as
informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux.</p>
<p>The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven
through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of
Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by
Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete
without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer,
his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia
in rebirth.</p>
<p>In this volume are selections from <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>,
<em>Return to Paradise</em>, <em>The Voice of Asia</em>, and the complete text of
<em>The Bridges at Toko-Ri</em>. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection selected from <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>
(Macmillan, 1947), <em>Return to Paradise</em> (RH, 1951), and <em>The Voice of
Asia</em> (RH, 1951), with the complete text of <em>The Bridges of Toko-ri</em>
(RH, 1953). Published April 1957. <em>WR</em> 29 April 1957. First printing:
7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.</p>
<p>In the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition
of his first book, <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>, “shows how little the
publisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a
chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the
poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start
new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One important change has been made in the text here offered, and
another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about
Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long
humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word
<em>Asiatic</em> when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word
to <em>Asian</em>. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps
even greater fervor the word <em>Chinaman</em>. After my first several books
appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what
I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I
have corrected this offensive word to <em>Chinese</em>; but in certain
stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have
retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I
would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of
<em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>. He signed with Random House on 19 April
1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August
2010). His second book, <em>The Fires of Spring</em>, was published by Random
House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long
and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of
Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose
the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to
use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has
made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to
Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton
University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a
1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at
Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old
Mansion,” <em>PW</em>, 13 July 1946, p. 174).</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in the capitalization of <em>The Bridges at Toko-ri</em> are
reproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a
jacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of
Toko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”</p>

Michener take on increased interest and importance as\n> informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux.\n>\n> The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven\n> through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of\n> Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by\n> Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete\n> without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer,\n> his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia\n> in rebirth.\n>\n> In this volume are selections from *Tales of the South Pacific*,\n> *Return to Paradise*, *The Voice of Asia*, and the complete text of\n> *The Bridges at Toko-Ri*. (*Spring 1957*)\n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific*\n(Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of\nAsia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri*\n(RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing:\n7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.\n\nIn the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition\nof his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the\npublisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a\nchance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the\npoorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start\nnew chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:\n\n> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and\n> another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about\n> Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long\n> humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word\n> *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word\n> to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps\n> even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books\n> appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what\n> I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I\n> have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain\n> stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have\n> retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I\n> would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).\n\nMichener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of\n*Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April\n1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August\n2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random\nHouse in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long\nand highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of\nSaxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose\nthe firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to\nuse a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has\nmade from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to\nDorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton\nUniversity Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a\n1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at\nMadison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old\nMansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174).\n\nInconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are\nreproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a\njacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of\nToko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”\n\n",
