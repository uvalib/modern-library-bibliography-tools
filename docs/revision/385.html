<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Non-pictorial in deep reddish orange (38) and black on cream

in black against deep reddish orange background; last line of front

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few novels of the last ten years have stirred up so much partisanship
and violent controversy as Arthur Koestler’s <em>Darkness at Noon</em>. Its
champions have proclaimed it as a penetrating study of revolutionary
psychology and the compulsions which lead to the catharsis of
confession; its adversaries, first to admit its overwhelming power,
attack it on the ground of its political implications. Both agree that
Arthur Koestler is a novelist of the foremost rank and a man with the
courage of his strong and brilliant convictions. (<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except last line of front panel: “<em>A
Book-of-the-Month Club Selection</em>”. (<em>Spring 1951</em>) <em>Note:</em> <em>Darkness at
Noon</em> had been a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1941. The wording
of the jacket may have been revised to avoid the suggestion that it was
a current selection. Front flap revised with first sentence beginning
“Few modern novels have stirred up” and the following sentence added at
the end: “Recent history has provided corroborating testimony to his
fictional critique of the ruthlessness of modern revolutionary
procedures.” (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1941. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–267) printed from Macmillan plates. Publication scheduled for
February 1946. <em>WR</em> 16 March 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>Kostler wrote <em>Darkness at Noon</em> in German while living in Paris. The
sculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was
Koestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris
separately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once
she was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of <em>Darkness at
Noon</em> with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August
2013).</p>
<p>Cerf initially wanted to publish <em>Darkness at Noon</em> in the ML in fall
1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I
think it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do
well with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12
January 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for
fall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on
the grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our
relations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam,
Macmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML
edition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of
10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).</p>
<p><em>Darkness at Noon</em> was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club
for June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years
later, the ML jacket stated “<em>The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection</em>”; in
the early 1950s the wording was changed to “<em>A Book-of-the-Month Club
Selection</em>”.</p>
<p><em>Darkness at Noon</em> sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period,
November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and
Giant titles.</p>

Its\n> champions have proclaimed it as a penetrating study of revolutionary\n> psychology and the compulsions which lead to the catharsis of\n> confession; its adversaries, first to admit its overwhelming power,\n> attack it on the ground of its political implications.

(*Spring 1946*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except last line of front panel: “*A\nBook-of-the-Month Club Selection*”. (*Spring 1951*) *Note:* *Darkness at\nNoon* had been a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1941. The wording\nof the jacket may have been revised to avoid the suggestion that it was\na current selection. Front flap revised with first sentence beginning\n“Few modern novels have stirred up” and the following sentence added at\nthe end: “Recent history has provided corroborating testimony to his\nfictional critique of the ruthlessness of modern revolutionary\nprocedures.” (*Fall 1956*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1941. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–267) printed from Macmillan plates. Publication scheduled for\nFebruary 1946. *WR* 16 March 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies.\n\nKostler wrote *Darkness at Noon* in German while living in Paris. The\nsculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was\nKoestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris\nseparately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once\nshe was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of *Darkness at\nNoon* with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August\n2013).\n\nCerf initially wanted to publish *Darkness at Noon* in the ML in fall\n1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I\nthink it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do\nwell with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12\nJanuary 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for\nfall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on\nthe grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our\nrelations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam,\nMacmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML\nedition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of\n10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).\n\n*Darkness at Noon* was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club\nfor June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years\nlater, the ML jacket stated “*The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection*”; in\nthe early 1950s the wording was changed to “*A Book-of-the-Month Club\nSelection*”.\n\n*Darkness at Noon* sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.",
