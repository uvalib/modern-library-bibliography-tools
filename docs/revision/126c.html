<h1>126c</h1>
<h2>Preliminaries repaginated; printed from duplicate set of plates (1929)</h2>
<div class="md-block"><p>Title as 126b.</p>
<p>Pp. [i–iv] v–ix [x], [<em>2</em>], [1–2] 3–506 [507–508].
[1–16]<sup>16</sup> [17]<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] pub. note D5; [iii] title; [iv] <em>Books by
Thomas Hardy</em> | <em>in</em> THE MODERN LIBRARY; v <em>PREFACE</em> signed: T. H. |
<em>July</em> 1895.; [vi] blank; vii–[x] CONTENTS; [<em>1</em>] fly title;
[<em>2</em>] blank; [1]–[508] as 126a.</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Kinship with nature and tenderness with human frailty characterize
Thomas Hardy’s brooding and powerful novel, <em>The Return of the
Native</em>. He sets his stage on the heaths and in the villages of his
beloved Wessex and unfolds a drama that becomes the living symbol for
the universal struggle of existence. His characters have the solidity
of the landscape against which they enact their tragic fates, and if
one stands out above the others, she is Eustacia Vye, as memorable a
woman as life or the art of Thomas Hardy could create. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial, probably a smaller version of 126d jacket.
Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1938; probably unsigned. (<em>Not seen</em>)</p>
<p>The Harper plates used for ML printings through 1928 had become badly
worn and Klopfer decided that the ML could not make another printing
from them. He asked Harper’s for their “other set [of plates] so we
can do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper &amp; Bros., 16 May 1929).
Harper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June
(Harper &amp; Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later
that month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.</p>
<p>There are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition
to the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b
include signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates
used for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their
charm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm”
in 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good
morning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after
“good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a
reader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML
informed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.</p>

(*Spring 1934*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial, probably a smaller version of 126d jacket.\nDesigned by Paul Galdone, October 1938; probably unsigned. (*Not seen*)\n\nThe Harper plates used for ML printings through 1928 had become badly\nworn and Klopfer decided that the ML could not make another printing\nfrom them. He asked Harper’s for their “other set \\[of plates\\] so we\ncan do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 16 May 1929).\nHarper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June\n(Harper & Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later\nthat month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.\n\nThere are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition\nto the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b\ninclude signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates\nused for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their\ncharm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm”\nin 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good\nmorning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after\n“good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a\nreader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML\ninformed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.\n\n",
