Within the last three decades the American drama has challenged and

internationally famous playwrights has won the world’s attention and
respect. This volume, representative of the finest work of America’s
foremost dramatists, brings together[+,] for the excitement and
delight of the reader [+, a half dozen] plays in a variety of moods
and forms: Eugene O’Neill’s imaginative <em>The Emperor Jones</em>, Maxwell
Anderson’s tense <em>Winterset</em>, Kaufman and Hart’s satirical <em>The Man
Who Came to Dinner</em>, Lillian Hellman’s bitterly penetrating <em>The
Little Foxes</em>, Tennessee Williams’ sensitive <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>,
and Heggen and Logan’s robust comedy <em>Mister Roberts</em>. (<em>Fall 1951;
Spring 1962]</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Published fall 1951. <em>WR</em> 29 December 1951. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Six Modern American Plays</em> was originally intended for Modern Library
College Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and added
later to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee $150 for selecting the
plays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950).
Halline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline
began by suggesting Anderson’s <em>Winterset</em>, Kaufman and Hart’s <em>The Man
Who Came to Dinner</em>, O’Neill’s <em>Mourning Becomes Electra</em>, Robert
Sherwood’s <em>There Shall Be No Night</em>, Philip Barry’s <em>Hotel Universe</em>,
and Sidney Howard’s <em>Yellow Jack</em>. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who
rejected <em>Hotel Universe</em> and <em>Yellow Jack</em> and indicated his preferred
for O’Neill’s <em>Emperor Jones</em> and Sherwood’s <em>Abe Lincoln in Illinois</em>.</p>
<p>Stein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’s
<em>Little Foxes</em>. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new
dramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’s <em>Glass Menagerie</em>
or <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, Arthur Miller’s <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, or
Heggen and Logan’s <em>Mister Roberts;</em> his own preference, he indicated,
was Williams. Halline approved <em>The Emperor Jones</em>, <em>Abe Lincoln in
Illinois</em> and <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> (Halline to Stein, 28 September
1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup: <em>The Emperor
Jones</em>, <em>Winterset</em>, <em>The Man Who Came to Dinner</em>, <em>The Little Foxes</em>,
<em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, and <em>Abe Lincoln in Illinois</em>. Sherwood’s play
was dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission. <em>Death of a
Salesman</em> was the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty
than the ML was prepared to pay. <em>Mister Roberts</em> was finally selected,
in part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid
royalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay
half a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition.</p>
<p>In the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the
introduction only.</p>
<p>Stein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out
the anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The
costs of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College
Edition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find
some way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline,
25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951). <em>Six Modern American
Plays</em> was added to MLCE in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>O’Neill’s <em>Emperor Jones</em> is reprinted in the version originally
published by Boni and Liveright in 1921. For more information see
O’Neill, <em>The Emperor Jones; The Straw</em> (1928: 157).</p>

(*Fall 1951;\n> Spring 1962\\]*)\n\n*Jacket A2:* As jacket A1 except on coated white paper. Front flap as\njacket A1 with spring 1962 flap text. (*Mid-1960s*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published fall 1951. *WR* 29 December 1951. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\n*Six Modern American Plays* was originally intended for Modern Library\nCollege Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and added\nlater to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee $150 for selecting the\nplays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950).\nHalline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline\nbegan by suggesting Anderson’s *Winterset*, Kaufman and Hart’s *The Man\nWho Came to Dinner*, O’Neill’s *Mourning Becomes Electra*, Robert\nSherwood’s *There Shall Be No Night*, Philip Barry’s *Hotel Universe*,\nand Sidney Howard’s *Yellow Jack*. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who\nrejected *Hotel Universe* and *Yellow Jack* and indicated his preferred\nfor O’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* and Sherwood’s *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*.\n\nStein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’s\n*Little Foxes*. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new\ndramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’s *Glass Menagerie*\nor *A Streetcar Named Desire*, Arthur Miller’s *Death of a Salesman*, or\nHeggen and Logan’s *Mister Roberts;* his own preference, he indicated,\nwas Williams. Halline approved *The Emperor Jones*, *Abe Lincoln in\nIllinois* and *The Glass Menagerie* (Halline to Stein, 28 September\n1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup: *The Emperor\nJones*, *Winterset*, *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, *The Little Foxes*,\n*The Glass Menagerie*, and *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*. Sherwood’s play\nwas dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission. *Death of a\nSalesman* was the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty\nthan the ML was prepared to pay. *Mister Roberts* was finally selected,\nin part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid\nroyalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay\nhalf a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition.\n\nIn the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the\nintroduction only.\n\nStein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out\nthe anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The\ncosts of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College\nEdition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find\nsome way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline,\n25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951). *Six Modern American\nPlays* was added to MLCE in the mid-1960s.\n\nO’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* is reprinted in the version originally\npublished by Boni and Liveright in 1921. For more information see\nO’Neill, *The Emperor Jones; The Straw* (1928: 157).\n\n",
