<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
From the time of Goethe to that of Kafka and Thomas Mann, the writers
of the German short story have produced some of the most enduring
classics of all literature. This anthology includes not only such
striking examples of contemporary writing as Kafka’s “A Country
Doctor” and Mann’s “Death in Venice,” but most of the classics from
the grand tradition of the German short story in the nineteenth
century. Two of the tales in this volume, Heinrich Mann’s
“Three-Minute Novel” and Kleist’s “Earthquake in Chile,” in new
translations by Professor Lange, are presented for the first time in a
popular edition. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Great German Short Novels and
Stories</em>, ed. Bennett A. Cerf (256). Published December 1952. <em>WR</em> 10
January 1953. First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on
16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the
entire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.</p>
<p>Lange suggested a revision of the ML anthology <em>Great German Short
Novels and Stories</em> after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s
<em>Faust</em> which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930:
200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only
collection of German narrative prose in English translation that the
student is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely
unsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to
Stein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein
to Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of
contents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two
exceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for
economic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length
of the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s <em>Immensee</em> instead of
replacing it with the author’s <em>Carsten Curator</em> “because it has become
a ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange
that “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical
sketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the
stories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen
selections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s
original anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a
different translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of
$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid
the cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for
selections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death
in Venice” (see 256).</p>

Based on design by Paul Galdone.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> From the time of Goethe to that of Kafka and Thomas Mann, the writers\n> of the German short story have produced some of the most enduring\n> classics of all literature. This anthology includes not only such\n> striking examples of contemporary writing as Kafka’s “A Country\n> Doctor” and Mann’s “Death in Venice,” but most of the classics from\n> the grand tradition of the German short story in the nineteenth\n> century. Two of the tales in this volume, Heinrich Mann’s\n> “Three-Minute Novel” and Kleist’s “Earthquake in Chile,” in new\n> translations by Professor Lange, are presented for the first time in a\n> popular edition. (*Fall 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Great German Short Novels and\nStories*, ed. Bennett A. Cerf (256). Published December 1952. *WR* 10\nJanuary 1953. First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on\n16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the\nentire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.\n\nLange suggested a revision of the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s\n*Faust* which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930:\n200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only\ncollection of German narrative prose in English translation that the\nstudent is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely\nunsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to\nStein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein\nto Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of\ncontents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two\nexceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for\neconomic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length\nof the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s *Immensee* instead of\nreplacing it with the author’s *Carsten Curator* “because it has become\na ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange\nthat “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical\nsketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the\nstories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen\nselections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s\noriginal anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a\ndifferent translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of\n$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid\nthe cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for\nselections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death\nin Venice” (see 256).\n\n",
