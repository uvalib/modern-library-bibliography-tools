<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
POOR WHITE tells the story of the American power that dots a vast
valley with cities overnight, and builds a network of industry, making
quick men rich and fearful men poor. The hero works for this force
although he doesn’t like or understand it. He is a dreamy, rather
stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical
tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made
[<em>sic</em>] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s”
love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a
wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as
the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of
our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic
majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and
develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is
fulfilled. (<em>Fall 1925)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br>
As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a
supreme position among American novelists. <em>Poor White</em>, like
<em>Winesburg, Ohio</em> (No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately
upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary
writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making
men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly
from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the
naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world
celebrated. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking
Press, August 1925. ML edition (pp. [1]–371) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings.
Published February 1926. <em>WR</em> 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000
copies. Discontinued fall 1939.</p>
<p>When Anderson became a B&amp;L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed
interest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including
<em>Poor White</em> in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April
1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s
contract with B&amp;L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately
endeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in
writing, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library”
(contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML
before <em>Poor White</em> could be added to the series. It is not known
whether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or
after the sale.</p>
<p>For writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML
books instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925).
He wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to
be published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to
call on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long
rows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little
like a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city”
(ML ed., p. vi).</p>
<p>The dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was
divorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request
(Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication
was inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Poor White</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th
out of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies
by April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000
copies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).</p>

He is a dreamy, rather\n> stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical\n> tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made\n> \\[*sic*\\] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s”\n> love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a\n> wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as\n> the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of\n> our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic\n> majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and\n> develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is\n> fulfilled. (*Fall 1925)*\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap: <br>\n> As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a\n> supreme position among American novelists. *Poor White*, like\n> *Winesburg, Ohio* (No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately\n> upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary\n> writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making\n> men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly\n> from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the\n> naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world\n> celebrated. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking\nPress, August 1925. ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–371) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings.\nPublished February 1926. *WR* 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued fall 1939.\n\nWhen Anderson became a B&L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed\ninterest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including\n*Poor White* in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April\n1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s\ncontract with B&L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately\nendeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in\nwriting, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library”\n(contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML\nbefore *Poor White* could be added to the series. It is not known\nwhether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or\nafter the sale.\n\nFor writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML\nbooks instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925).\nHe wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to\nbe published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to\ncall on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long\nrows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little\nlike a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city”\n(ML ed., p. vi).\n\nThe dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was\ndivorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request\n(Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication\nwas inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).\n\nSales of *Poor White* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th\nout of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies\nby April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000\ncopies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nAnderson, *Winesburg, Ohio* (1921–1973) 96",
