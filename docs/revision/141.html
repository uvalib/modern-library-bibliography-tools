<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
REMY DE GOURMONT’S somewhat cerebral passions have ample scope in the
suave story of the courtship of a presumably innocent young girl by a
sophisticated middle-aged man, incorporated in “A Virgin Heart.”
Contrary to the accepted notion and to the ideas of the amorous M.
Hervart, the modest, gentle, unassuming Rose is surprised at nothing,
except the tepidity and reserve of her lover. Abstraction, insinuation
and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s
limpid and flexibly articulated prose.</p>
<p>Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the
flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the
authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product,
almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered
almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont.</p>
<p>(Remy de Gourmont’s “A Night in the Luxembourg” is volume Number 120
in the Modern Library) (Spring 1927)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<p>Huxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New
edition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its
acquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by
Greenberg. ML edition (pp. [5]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg
plates. Published June 1927. <em>WR</em> 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000
copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933.</p>
<p>Edmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical
champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (<em>Axel’s Castle</em>, p. 22).</p>
<p>Huxley’s translation of <em>A Virgin Heart</em> appeared in the U.S. five years
before Allen &amp; Unwin published it in Britain.</p>
<p>The ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000
copies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated
<em>A Virgin Heart</em>, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley
declined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh
his memory of <em>A Virgin Heart</em> and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to
Cerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an
introduction.</p>
<p>Greenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year
after the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain,
noting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our
Modern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the
spirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this
title has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg,
21 October 1927).</p>
<p>There were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between
November 1928 and December 1931. After <em>A Virgin Heart</em> was
discontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern
Library” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold,
most of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June
1933).</p>

(*Fall 1930*)\n\nHuxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New\nedition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its\nacquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by\nGreenberg. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg\nplates. Published June 1927. *WR* 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1933.\n\nEdmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical\nchampion of the \\[Symbolist\\] movement” (*Axel’s Castle*, p. 22).\n\nHuxley’s translation of *A Virgin Heart* appeared in the U.S. five years\nbefore Allen & Unwin published it in Britain.\n\nThe ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000\ncopies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated\n*A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley\ndeclined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh\nhis memory of *A Virgin Heart* and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to\nCerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an\nintroduction.\n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year\nafter the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain,\nnoting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our\nModern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the\nspirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this\ntitle has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg,\n21 October 1927).\n\nThere were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between\nNovember 1928 and December 1931. After *A Virgin Heart* was\ndiscontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold,\nmost of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June\n1933).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nGourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926–1932) 125",
