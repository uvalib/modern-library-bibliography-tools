<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This book is one of the best accounts of the colorful period of
Italian life and thought between 1350 and 1550. Here is a brilliant
panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts,
fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in
the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well
how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give
generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship
between the individual and the forces around him. The combination
makes this book one of the few great classics of history. (<em>Spring
1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25
May 1954. <em>WR</em> 29 May 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued
1971/72. Reissued 1980–91.</p>
<p>Klopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition of <em>Civilization of the
Renaissance in Italy</em>. Stein thought the idea was a good one and
indicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo
Holborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some
required college sale and am quite confident that it will have a
satisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October
1953). Holborn received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11
November 1953).</p>
<p>The ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the
public domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf
offered George Allen &amp; Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a
courtesy fee of $500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any
considerable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that
will balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities
but less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953).
The ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen &amp; Unwin
and includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C.
Middlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged
rendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by
comparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig
Goldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes
and has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material
preceded by asterisks” (p. [iv]).</p>

Here is a brilliant\n> panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts,\n> fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in\n> the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well\n> how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give\n> generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship\n> between the individual and the forces around him. The combination\n> makes this book one of the few great classics of history. (*Spring\n> 1954*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25\nMay 1954. *WR* 29 May 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued\n1971/72. Reissued 1980–91.\n\nKlopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition of *Civilization of the\nRenaissance in Italy*. Stein thought the idea was a good one and\nindicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo\nHolborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some\nrequired college sale and am quite confident that it will have a\nsatisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October\n1953). Holborn received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11\nNovember 1953).\n\nThe ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the\npublic domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf\noffered George Allen & Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a\ncourtesy fee of $500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any\nconsiderable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that\nwill balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities\nbut less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953).\nThe ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen & Unwin\nand includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C.\nMiddlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged\nrendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by\ncomparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig\nGoldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes\nand has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material\npreceded by asterisks” (p. \\[iv\\]).\n\n",
