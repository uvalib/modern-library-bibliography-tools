<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Non-pictorial in light blue (181), moderate blue (182),
brilliant yellow (83) and black on coated cream paper; central portion
in black shading into moderate and light blue with black rays radiating
from center to lighter areas; title on front panel in brilliant yellow;
other lettering in black at lower right; spine title in reverse. Text at
lower right: “Nostradamus, Europe’s greatest prophet, foresaw three
centuries ago events which history has confirmed with uncanny frequency.
His ‘prophetic centuries’ forecast the fall of Paris, war in the air,
the invasion of Britain. Read the fateful happenings predicted tomorrow
for Europe and America by the sixteenth-century soothsayer whom Hitler
relies upon today.” Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1941; unsigned.
<em>Note:</em> The statement “the sixteenth-century soothsayer whom Hitler
relies upon today” remained unchanged until the late 1960s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
World events are rapidly catching up with the prophecies made by
Nostradamus three hundred years ago. Whether his predictions were
accidental or based upon an occult foreknowledge, they are frequently
uncanny in their accuracy. His book of oracles is having a tremendous
vogue at present, partly because of the wide variety of
interpretations that can be made from his prognostications, but mainly
because it makes fascinating reading when related to the catastrophes
announced daily while the world is in crisis. This edition
[±volume], edited by Charles A. Ward, gives special emphasis to
prophecies of contemporary events and those immediately ahead. (<em>Fall
1941; [Fall 1954]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Scribner &amp; Welford, 1891; published with
Supplement by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1940. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting with the frontispiece from the 1672
London edition omitted from the Supplement. The 1940 Scribner printing
places the Supplement after the index and paginates it separately from
the rest of the text; the ML edition places the Supplement before the
index. Published February 1942. <em>WR</em> 14 February 1942. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML edition of <em>Oracles of Nostradamus</em> was published two months
after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The decision to include
Nostradamus had been made before the United States entered the war. Cerf
commented, “We put that title in, possibly with our tongues in our
cheeks, because people seem to be interested in predictions of a strange
character” (“Of Men and Books: Critic John C. Frederick, guest Bennett
Cerf, in a Radio Conversation over the Columbia Broadcasting System,”
<em>Northwestern University on the Air</em> 2, no. 16 [16 January1943], p.
4).</p>
<p>When the United States declared war on Japan on 8 December 1941 and
recognized a state of war with Germany and Italy three days later, the
future looked dark and the outcome of the war was uncertain. <em>The
Oracles of Nostradamus</em> became one of the Modern Library’s best-selling
titles. It sold 16,043 copies during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943. Only five ML titles—Maugham’s <em>Of Human Bondage</em>
(199) and Dostoyevsky’s <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (228) in the regular
series, and <em>The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud</em> (G37), James T.
Farrell’s <em>Studs Lonigan</em> (G39), and <em>The Short Stories of Ernest
Hemingway</em> (G59) in the Giants—sold more copies during this period.</p>
<p><em>The Oracles of Nostradamus</em> did not rank among the 100 best-selling
regular ML titles in 1951/52.</p>

Text at\nlower right: “Nostradamus, Europe’s greatest prophet, foresaw three\ncenturies ago events which history has confirmed with uncanny frequency.\nHis ‘prophetic centuries’ forecast the fall of Paris, war in the air,\nthe invasion of Britain. Read the fateful happenings predicted tomorrow\nfor Europe and America by the sixteenth-century soothsayer whom Hitler\nrelies upon today.” Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1941; unsigned.\n*Note:* The statement “the sixteenth-century soothsayer whom Hitler\nrelies upon today” remained unchanged until the late 1960s.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> World events are rapidly catching up with the prophecies made by\n> Nostradamus three hundred years ago.

(*Fall\n> 1941; \\[Fall 1954\\]*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Scribner & Welford, 1891; published with\nSupplement by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1940. ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting with the frontispiece from the 1672\nLondon edition omitted from the Supplement. The 1940 Scribner printing\nplaces the Supplement after the index and paginates it separately from\nthe rest of the text; the ML edition places the Supplement before the\nindex. Published February 1942. *WR* 14 February 1942. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML edition of *Oracles of Nostradamus* was published two months\nafter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The decision to include\nNostradamus had been made before the United States entered the war. Cerf\ncommented, “We put that title in, possibly with our tongues in our\ncheeks, because people seem to be interested in predictions of a strange\ncharacter” (“Of Men and Books: Critic John C. Frederick, guest Bennett\nCerf, in a Radio Conversation over the Columbia Broadcasting System,”\n*Northwestern University on the Air* 2, no. 16 \\[16 January1943\\], p.\n4).\n\nWhen the United States declared war on Japan on 8 December 1941 and\nrecognized a state of war with Germany and Italy three days later, the\nfuture looked dark and the outcome of the war was uncertain. *The\nOracles of Nostradamus* became one of the Modern Library’s best-selling\ntitles. It sold 16,043 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943. Only five ML titles—Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage*\n(199) and Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228) in the regular\nseries, and *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* (G37), James T.\nFarrell’s *Studs Lonigan* (G39), and *The Short Stories of Ernest\nHemingway* (G59) in the Giants—sold more copies during this period.\n\n*The Oracles of Nostradamus* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\nregular ML titles in 1951/52.\n\n",
