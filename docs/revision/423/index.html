<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“The tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains”
undertaken by Francis Parkman in 1846 became a journey of research and
brought forth, three years later, one of the permanent historical
records of American expansion. At first hand Parkman gathered from
Sioux Indians, hunters and trappers the material which was to make
<em>The Oregon Trail</em> as much a tale of adventure as an authentic
chronicle of the frontier. Exactly a century after its first
publication, it takes its place in the Modern Library series,
introduced by a distinguished contemporary historian, Henry Steele
Commager. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for fall 1949. <em>WR</em> 11 February 1950. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p><em>The Oregon Trail</em> was originally scheduled for publication in the
Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received $2,000
for the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page
drawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of
the chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were
to be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21
January 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before
escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated
Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both <em>The Oregon
Trail</em> and Alcott’s <em>Little Women</em>, the other Illustrated Modern Library
title announced for fall 1947.</p>
<p>At this point the type for <em>The Oregon Trail</em> was in galleys and the
plates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for
nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish <em>The
Oregon Trail</em> without illustrations in the regular ML. <em>Little Women</em>
(431) was added to the regular series the following year.</p>
<p>The jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss
made for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the
introduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote
him about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume
was at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29
June 1949).</p>

At first hand Parkman gathered from\n> Sioux Indians, hunters and trappers the material which was to make\n> *The Oregon Trail* as much a tale of adventure as an authentic\n> chronicle of the frontier. Exactly a century after its first\n> publication, it takes its place in the Modern Library series,\n> introduced by a distinguished contemporary historian, Henry Steele\n> Commager. (*Fall 1949*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for fall 1949. *WR* 11 February 1950. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\n*The Oregon Trail* was originally scheduled for publication in the\nIllustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received $2,000\nfor the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page\ndrawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of\nthe chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were\nto be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21\nJanuary 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before\nescalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated\nModern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both *The Oregon\nTrail* and Alcott’s *Little Women*, the other Illustrated Modern Library\ntitle announced for fall 1947.\n\nAt this point the type for *The Oregon Trail* was in galleys and the\nplates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for\nnearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *The\nOregon Trail* without illustrations in the regular ML. *Little Women*\n(431) was added to the regular series the following year.\n\nThe jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss\nmade for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the\nintroduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote\nhim about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume\nwas at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29\nJune 1949).",
