<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The perennial success of <em>Les Miserables</em> in the Modern Library has
induced the editors to add Victor Hugo’s companion masterpiece, <em>The
Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, to the series. Adult readers of every taste
and opinion turn back to these monumental novels of the Romantic
School for escape [+and excitement] and solace, and new generations
receive their first introduction to the world of good books by the
discovery of such [+pulse-quickening] novels as <em>The Hunchback of
Notre Dame</em>. Young and old are rewarded by a story that stirs the
heart and kindles the imagination. (<em>Spring 1941; [Fall 1953]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. and
other publishers. ML edition (pp. [5]–416) printed from Burt plates
with the table of contents reset. Published January 1941. <em>WR</em> 25
January 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on
the first printing of Hugo’s <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> (1831) and does not
include three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in
December 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and
Book Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation
used by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and
Book Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and
5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not
“augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The
three added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been
misplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be
included in the 1832 printing (Hugo, <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em>, translated
and edited by John Sturrock [London: Penguin Books, 2004], pp. 26–29).</p>
<p>The absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill
That), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the
printing press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the
public expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during
the world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan
pagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of
the human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious
symbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own
monument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191).</p>
<p>When the ML reprinted <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> in 1996 as part of
the “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous
and incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and
1971.</p>
<p><em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> sold 4,004 copies during the 18-month
period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter
of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November
1951–October 1952. Hugo’s <em>Les Misérables</em> (G3) was in first quarter of
ML titles at both periods.</p>

Young and old are rewarded by a story that stirs the\n> heart and kindles the imagination. (*Spring 1941; \\[Fall 1953\\]*)\n\nAnonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. and\nother publishers. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–416) printed from Burt plates\nwith the table of contents reset. Published January 1941. *WR* 25\nJanuary 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on\nthe first printing of Hugo’s *Notre-Dame de Paris* (1831) and does not\ninclude three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in\nDecember 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and\nBook Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation\nused by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and\nBook Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and\n5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not\n“augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The\nthree added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been\nmisplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be\nincluded in the 1832 printing (Hugo, *Notre-Dame de Paris*, translated\nand edited by John Sturrock \\[London: Penguin Books, 2004\\], pp. 26–29).\n\nThe absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill\nThat), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the\nprinting press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the\npublic expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during\nthe world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan\npagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of\nthe human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious\nsymbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own\nmonument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191).\n\nWhen the ML reprinted *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* in 1996 as part of\nthe “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous\nand incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and\n1971.\n\n*The Hunchback of Notre Dame* sold 4,004 copies during the 18-month\nperiod 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter\nof ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952. Hugo’s *Les Misérables* (G3) was in first quarter of\nML titles at both periods.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nHugo, *Les Misérables* (Giant, 1931–1973, 1980– ) G3",
