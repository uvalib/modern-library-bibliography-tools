(<em>Spring 1944</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Anthology of American Negro
Literature</em>, ed. V. F. Calverton (183). Publication announced for spring
1944. <em>WR</em> 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1957.</p>
<p>Watkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s <em>Anthology of
American Negro Literature</em> (1929) included short stories, selections
from novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and
autobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories,
essays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection
represents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s
Negro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the
Negro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind
about his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp.
xi–xii).</p>
<p>For poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have
been published in this field: <em>Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro
Poetry for Young Readers</em>, by Arna Bontemps; <em>Book of American Negro
Poetry</em>, by James Weldon Johnson; <em>Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse
by Negro Poets</em>, by Countee Cullen; <em>Negro Voices, An Anthology of
Contemporary Verse</em>, by Beatrice M. Murphy; <em>Negro Poets and Their
Poems</em>, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from
novels he recommends “that the following novels be read: <em>Their Eyes
Were Watching God</em>, by Zora N. Hurston; <em>Home to Harlem</em>, by Claude
McKay; <em>The Blacker the Berry</em>, by Wallace Thurman; <em>My Lives and How I
Lost Them</em>, by Countee Cullen; <em>These Low Gro</em>unds, by W. E. Turpin;
<em>Blood on the Forge</em>, by William Attaway; <em>Black Thunder</em>, by Arna
Bontemps; <em>Native Son</em>, by Richard Wright, and <em>The White Face</em>, by Carl
R. Offord” (p. xiii).</p>
<p>Keneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to <em>The Negro
Caravan</em>, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee
(Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that <em>The Negro Caravan</em> has been
highly influential in establishing a canon of African-American
literature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that
endures. He does not believe the same is true for the <em>Anthology of
American Negro Literature</em> (1944). (Kinnamon, 1997)</p>

Front flap as 183b.\n(*Spring 1944*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Anthology of American Negro\nLiterature*, ed. V. F. Calverton (183). Publication announced for spring\n1944. *WR* 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1957.\n\nWatkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1929) included short stories, selections\nfrom novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and\nautobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories,\nessays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection\nrepresents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s\nNegro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the\nNegro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind\nabout his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp.\nxi–xii).\n\nFor poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have\nbeen published in this field: *Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro\nPoetry for Young Readers*, by Arna Bontemps; *Book of American Negro\nPoetry*, by James Weldon Johnson; *Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse\nby Negro Poets*, by Countee Cullen; *Negro Voices, An Anthology of\nContemporary Verse*, by Beatrice M. Murphy; *Negro Poets and Their\nPoems*, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from\nnovels he recommends “that the following novels be read: *Their Eyes\nWere Watching God*, by Zora N. Hurston; *Home to Harlem*, by Claude\nMcKay; *The Blacker the Berry*, by Wallace Thurman; *My Lives and How I\nLost Them*, by Countee Cullen; *These Low Gro*unds, by W. E. Turpin;\n*Blood on the Forge*, by William Attaway; *Black Thunder*, by Arna\nBontemps; *Native Son*, by Richard Wright, and *The White Face*, by Carl\nR. Offord” (p. xiii).\n\nKeneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to *The Negro\nCaravan*, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee\n(Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that *The Negro Caravan* has been\nhighly influential in establishing a canon of African-American\nliterature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that\nendures. He does not believe the same is true for the *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1944).
