<p>Front flap:<br>
The most ambitious project ever undertaken by the Modern Library is
the publication of the complete and unabridged works of William
Shakespeare in three volumes. Given the leading place on the list as
Numbers 1, 2 and 3—Tragedies, Comedies, and Histories and Poems—these
volumes of over 1,200, 1,100 and 1,100 pages are scrupulously faithful
to the highest standards of scholarship. They are printed in large,
clear type, with special consideration for readability, and are bound
for durability in a format distinguished for its beauty and utility.
Each volume is implemented with Notes and a Glossary. (<em>Fall 1943</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), strong green (141)
grayish brown (61), and black on coated white paper with drawing of an
armored helmet topped by a crown in grayish brown encircled by a snake
and with a bloodstained sword and roses; lettering in vivid reddish
orange and black with titles of individual plays below the drawing,
borders at head and foot in grayish brown; backstrip with variation of
front panel drawing at head; title in reverse on red and black bands.
Signed: St.</p>
<p>Front flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1944</em>)</p>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for November 1943. <em>WR</em> 30 October 1943. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from <em>The Complete Works
of Shakespeare</em>, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904),
and its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20
vols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and
Oxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its
text publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text,
Commins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the
request that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to
William T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).</p>
<p>At least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the <em>New
Republic</em>, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very
agreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be
congratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an
omission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right
to know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who
has done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer,
“Editions of Shakespeare,” <em>New Republic</em>, 10 January 1944, p. 57).</p>
<p>The drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated
graphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the
<em>Tragedies</em>, red for the <em>Comedies</em>, blue for the <em>Histories and
Poems</em>). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis
Miller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the
original jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the
second printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25
August 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the
proof stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare
jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present
a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is
altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.</p>
<p>Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets,
so that while they are held together by a common thread of
recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have
its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely
that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I
continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in
other colors.</p>
<p>I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I
ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam
Goldwyn, and give me what I want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML
to keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World
War. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the
fall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by
different jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the
only printings during the war.</p>
<p>The war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but
it took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from
wartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be
three or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted
because of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to
Mr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation,
which made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95
cents and break even, was an additional complication.</p>
<p>The Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time
each volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume
set.</p>

Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from *The Complete Works\nof Shakespeare*, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904),\nand its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20\nvols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and\nOxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its\ntext publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text,\nCommins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the\nrequest that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to\nWilliam T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).\n\nAt least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the *New\nRepublic*, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very\nagreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be\ncongratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an\nomission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right\nto know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who\nhas done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer,\n“Editions of Shakespeare,” *New Republic*, 10 January 1944, p. 57).\n\nThe drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated\ngraphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the\n*Tragedies*, red for the *Comedies*, blue for the *Histories and\nPoems*). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis\nMiller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the\noriginal jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the\nsecond printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25\nAugust 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the\nproof stage:\n\n> The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare\n> jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present\n> a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is\n> altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.\n>\n> Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets,\n> so that while they are held together by a common thread of\n> recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have\n> its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely\n> that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I\n> continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in\n> other colors.\n>\n> I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I\n> ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam\n> Goldwyn, and give me what I want.\n\nThe length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML\nto keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World\nWar. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the\nfall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by\ndifferent jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the\nonly printings during the war.\n\nThe war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but\nit took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from\nwartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be\nthree or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted\nbecause of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to\nMr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation,\nwhich made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95\ncents and break even, was an additional complication.\n\nThe Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time\neach volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume\nset.\n\n",
