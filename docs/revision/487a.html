<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“As time passes,” writes John Gassner, “one name among the post-Ibsen
dramatists leads all the rest.” That one is Anton Chekhov, whose major
plays are presented here in the remarkably sensitive and skillful
translations of Stark Young.</p>
<p>For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp and
poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding, these
plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Chekhov world
famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal
experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not
only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most
revered. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding <em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em>,
translated by Constance Garnett (193). Published October 1956. <em>WR</em> 5
November 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1986.</p>
<p>Young received a $900 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on all
copies sold in the U.S. and 5 percent of the net sums received from all
copies sold at export. He received an additional $100 for writing the
introduction. A year before Chekhov’s <em>Best Plays</em> was published Stein
had reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern
Library were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer
regarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the
excellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,
<em>The Cherry Orchard</em>, <em>The Three Sisters</em>, <em>Uncle Vanya</em>, and <em>The Sea
Gull</em>. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to
Lois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights;
there seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this
stage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange
for the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of
course go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo
to Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”</p>
<p>With the Young translation of Chekhov, <em>Best Plays</em> the ML reverted to
the spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring
1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript
of her preface to <em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em> (1930: 193) was probably
responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le
Gallienne file).</p>

Signed: Freund Lurye.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> “As time passes,” writes John Gassner, “one name among the post-Ibsen\n> dramatists leads all the rest.” That one is Anton Chekhov, whose major\n> plays are presented here in the remarkably sensitive and skillful\n> translations of Stark Young.\n>\n> For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp and\n> poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding, these\n> plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Chekhov world\n> famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal\n> experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not\n> only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most\n> revered. (*Fall 1956*)\n\nOriginal ML collection superseding *The Plays of Anton Tchekov*,\ntranslated by Constance Garnett (193). Published October 1956. *WR* 5\nNovember 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1986.\n\nYoung received a $900 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on all\ncopies sold in the U.S. and 5 percent of the net sums received from all\ncopies sold at export. He received an additional $100 for writing the\nintroduction. A year before Chekhov’s *Best Plays* was published Stein\nhad reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern\nLibrary were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer\nregarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the\nexcellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,\n*The Cherry Orchard*, *The Three Sisters*, *Uncle Vanya*, and *The Sea\nGull*. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to\nLois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights;\nthere seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this\nstage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange\nfor the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of\ncourse go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo\nto Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”\n\nWith the Young translation of Chekhov, *Best Plays* the ML reverted to\nthe spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring\n1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript\nof her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably\nresponsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le\nGallienne file).\n\n",
