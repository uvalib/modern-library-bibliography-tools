<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Millions of people have enjoyed <em>Show Boat</em> in at least one of its
many manifestations. First as a book it was a national best seller. As
a play, a musical comedy, a weekly radio feature for three years, and,
in its latest version, an operatic film, <em>Show Boat</em>, like the river
it celebrates, rolls on forever. Now in the Modern Library series,
Edna Ferber’s famous chronicle of the Mississippi summons a new
audience to Captain Andy Hawks’ floating palace of entertainment.
Jerome Kern, the well-known composer, provides a foreword. (<em>Fall
1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1926. ML edition (pp.
[ix]–398) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates with pp. [<em>2</em>–<em>3</em>]
adapted from the original title page with the imprint removed and the
title printed in smaller type. Published November 1935. <em>WR</em> 30 November
1935. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
31 December 1940.</p>
<p>Daniel Longwell of Doubleday, Doran asked Cerf in 1934 if Ferber’s <em>Show
Boat</em> or <em>So Big</em> could be included in the ML “in however small an
edition” and indicated that no advance on royalties would be required.
“It would help us tremendously,” he observed, “to be able to tell Edna
Ferber right now that you are going to do that” (Longwell to Cerf, 4
April 1934). Cerf replied that nothing could be done during the coming
season. “Our Fall Modern Library list already includes THE GREAT GATSBY,
PORGY, and LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL, and that is more than enough Americana
for this one installment!” (Cerf to Longwell, 9 April 1934). <em>Show Boat</em>
appeared in the ML the following year and was discontinued five years
later. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder
mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.</p>

(*Fall\n> 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[ix\\]–398) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates with pp. \\[*2*–*3*\\]\nadapted from the original title page with the imprint removed and the\ntitle printed in smaller type. Published November 1935. *WR* 30 November\n1935. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n31 December 1940.\n\nDaniel Longwell of Doubleday, Doran asked Cerf in 1934 if Ferber’s *Show\nBoat* or *So Big* could be included in the ML “in however small an\nedition” and indicated that no advance on royalties would be required.\n“It would help us tremendously,” he observed, “to be able to tell Edna\nFerber right now that you are going to do that” (Longwell to Cerf, 4\nApril 1934). Cerf replied that nothing could be done during the coming\nseason. “Our Fall Modern Library list already includes THE GREAT GATSBY,\nPORGY, and LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL, and that is more than enough Americana\nfor this one installment!” (Cerf to Longwell, 9 April 1934). *Show Boat*\nappeared in the ML the following year and was discontinued five years\nlater. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder\nmark of a star stamped on the endpaper.",
