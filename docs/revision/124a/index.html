<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“In this wild, beautiful romance, Herman Melville seems to have spoken
the very secret of the Sea, and to have drawn into his tale all the
magic, all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters. It stands
quite alone; it strikes a note no other sea writer has ever struck. It
is a work not only unique of its kind, but a great achievement—the
expression of an imagination that rises to the highest, and so is
amongst the world’s great works of art.” —<span class="smallcaps">John
Masefield</span></p>

unabridged).</em> (<em>Fall 1926</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in strong red (12) and black on cream paper with
inset black-and-white illustration by Rockwell Kent of a ship under full
sail; title and borders in strong red with title superimposed over Kent
illustration, other lettering in black. (<em>Spring 1932</em>) <em>Note:</em> Kent’s
illustration was created for the 3-volume limited edition of <em>Moby Dick</em>
published by Lakeside Press in 1930. Later that year Random House
published a one-volume trade edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting; the MLG edition (G65) printed from RH plates appeared in
1944. Kent’s illustration appears on p. 81 of RH/MLG printings. The
reproduction of the illustration on jacket C is slightly cropped at the
foot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the comparatively few books in the world’s literature about which
it is safe to foretell the verdict of posterity, <em>Moby Dick</em> stands in
the first rank. Universally recognized as one of the greatest of all
tales of the sea, it will live by its own surge and elemental force.
This mighty history of the pursuit of the vindictive monster, upon
which Herman Melville lavished all the resources of his imagination
and Jovian hate, is the symbol and the substance of reckless adventure
and indomitable courage. (<em>Spring</em> <u>(</u><em>1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
June 1926. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1976/77.</p>
<p>Melville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The
Library of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s,
published in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to
nineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank.
Emerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf
Whittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range
PS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of
nine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in
1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea
romances like <em>Typee</em> and <em>Omoo</em>. <em>Moby-Dick</em> sold poorly when it was
published in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.</p>
<p>The critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the
publication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, <em>Herman Melville: Mariner and
Mystic</em> (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of
<em>Billy Budd</em>, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver
edited the manuscript and published it in <em>Billy Budd and Other Prose
Pieces</em> (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years
later in <em>Shorter Novels of Herman Melville</em> (Horace Liveright, 1928).</p>
<p>Weaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His
biography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated
with a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published
autobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia
University’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course
in Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this
man had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . .
and discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and
a wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, pp. 17–18).</p>
<p>Weaver wrote introductions to two editions of <em>Moby-Dick</em> that were
published as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way.
His introduction to the edition published by Albert &amp; Charles Boni in
1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the
following year for the ML.</p>
<p>The ML may have tried to position its edition of <em>Moby-Dick</em> to appeal
both to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated
the darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from
Masefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful
romance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic,
all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s
introduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the
malice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of
leperous [<em>sic</em>] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Moby Dick</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th
out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943
it was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of <em>Moby
Dick</em> from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand
following American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven
printings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of
2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling
23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of <em>Moby Dick</em>
under the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar
“specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton
House titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a
departure from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality
paper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and
were sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed
500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department
stores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do
well with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated
that they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one
of those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to
Cerf, 18 August 1932).</p>
<p>The ML also published <em>Moby Dick</em> (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series,
using plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.</p>
<p>All ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the
spelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead
of the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of
the work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of
America edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions
that omit it.</p>
<p>The Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new
typesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth
Hardwick, is inconsistent. The title is <em>Moby-Dick or, The Whale</em>, but
the biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as <em>Moby
Dick</em>, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated
form when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form
when referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983),
which includes <em>Redburn</em> and <em>White-Jacket</em> as well as <em>Moby-Dick</em>, uses
the hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages
(pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record
chapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen,
with the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp.
985–991) are MOBY DICK.</p>

(*Spring 1932*) *Note:* Kent’s\nillustration was created for the 3-volume limited edition of *Moby Dick*\npublished by Lakeside Press in 1930. Later that year Random House\npublished a one-volume trade edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting; the MLG edition (G65) printed from RH plates appeared in\n1944. Kent’s illustration appears on p. 81 of RH/MLG printings. The\nreproduction of the illustration on jacket C is slightly cropped at the\nfoot.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Of the comparatively few books in the world’s literature about which\n> it is safe to foretell the verdict of posterity, *Moby Dick* stands in\n> the first rank. Universally recognized as one of the greatest of all\n> tales of the sea, it will live by its own surge and elemental force.\n> This mighty history of the pursuit of the vindictive monster, upon\n> which Herman Melville lavished all the resources of his imagination\n> and Jovian hate, is the symbol and the substance of reckless adventure\n> and indomitable courage. (*Spring* <u>(</u>*1939*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nJune 1926. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1976/77.\n\nMelville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The\nLibrary of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s,\npublished in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to\nnineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank.\nEmerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf\nWhittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range\nPS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of\nnine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in\n1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea\nromances like *Typee* and *Omoo*. *Moby-Dick* sold poorly when it was\npublished in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.\n\nThe critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the\npublication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, *Herman Melville: Mariner and\nMystic* (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of\n*Billy Budd*, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver\nedited the manuscript and published it in *Billy Budd and Other Prose\nPieces* (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years\nlater in *Shorter Novels of Herman Melville* (Horace Liveright, 1928).\n\nWeaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His\nbiography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated\nwith a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published\nautobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia\nUniversity’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course\nin Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this\nman had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . .\nand discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and\na wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 17–18).\n\nWeaver wrote introductions to two editions of *Moby-Dick* that were\npublished as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way.\nHis introduction to the edition published by Albert & Charles Boni in\n1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the\nfollowing year for the ML.\n\nThe ML may have tried to position its edition of *Moby-Dick* to appeal\nboth to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated\nthe darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from\nMasefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful\nromance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic,\nall the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s\nintroduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the\nmalice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of\nleperous \\[*sic*\\] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).\n\nSales of *Moby Dick* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th\nout of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943\nit was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of *Moby\nDick* from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand\nfollowing American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven\nprintings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of\n2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling\n23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).\n\nCerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of *Moby Dick*\nunder the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar\n“specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton\nHouse titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a\ndeparture from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality\npaper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and\nwere sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed\n500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department\nstores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do\nwell with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated\nthat they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nThe ML also published *Moby Dick* (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series,\nusing plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.\n\nAll ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the\nspelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead\nof the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of\nthe work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of\nAmerica edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions\nthat omit it.\n\nThe Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new\ntypesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth\nHardwick, is inconsistent. The title is *Moby-Dick or, The Whale*, but\nthe biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as *Moby\nDick*, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated\nform when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form\nwhen referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983),\nwhich includes *Redburn* and *White-Jacket* as well as *Moby-Dick*, uses\nthe hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages\n(pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record\nchapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen,\nwith the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp.\n985–991) are MOBY DICK.\n\n",
