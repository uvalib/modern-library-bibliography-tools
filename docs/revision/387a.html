<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library have tried to acquire
the rights of publication of the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories.
Now, by special arrangement with the Estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
<em>The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</em>, complete and
unabridged in one volume and comprising twenty-three of the greatest
tales to come from the pen of the master, is offered as the classic in
its field. Here for your mystification and delight are “The Red-Headed
League,” “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” “The Five Orange Pips”
and others of equal fame and favor. (<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for February 1946. <em>WR</em> 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably
10,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf contacted Harper &amp; Bros. in 1944 about including <em>The Adventures
and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</em> in the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance
against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10
cents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and
make new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a
way of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros., 27
April 1944). Harper &amp; Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred
Cerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle
Estate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being
difficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a
period of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible
limitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes
stories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).</p>
<p>Klopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with
Watt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped
its proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a
three-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt
to drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML
would be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer,
4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is
included in Cerf and Klopfer, <em>Dear Donald, Dear Bennett</em>, pp. 195–98).
He also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500
advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was
considering putting <em>The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</em> into
the Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that,
although the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years
and he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at
ten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed
to a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five
years.</p>
<p>Vincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the
ML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I
would rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of
the American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty
corrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was
published without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a
first printing of 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, placing <em>The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock
Holmes</em> high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

Signed: PG \\[Paul Galdone\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> For many years the editors of the Modern Library have tried to acquire\n> the rights of publication of the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories.\n> Now, by special arrangement with the Estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,\n> *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes*, complete and\n> unabridged in one volume and comprising twenty-three of the greatest\n> tales to come from the pen of the master, is offered as the classic in\n> its field. Here for your mystification and delight are “The Red-Headed\n> League,” “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” “The Five Orange Pips”\n> and others of equal fame and favor. (*Spring 1946*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for February 1946. *WR* 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably\n10,000 copies.\n\nCerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about including *The Adventures\nand Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* in the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance\nagainst royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10\ncents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and\nmake new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a\nway of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27\nApril 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred\nCerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle\nEstate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being\ndifficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a\nperiod of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible\nlimitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes\nstories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).\n\nKlopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with\nWatt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped\nits proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a\nthree-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt\nto drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML\nwould be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer,\n4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is\nincluded in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, pp. 195–98).\nHe also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was\nconsidering putting *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* into\nthe Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that,\nalthough the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years\nand he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at\nten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed\nto a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five\nyears.\n\nVincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the\nML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I\nwould rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of\nthe American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty\ncorrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was\npublished without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a\nfirst printing of 10,000 copies.\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock\nHolmes* high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n",
