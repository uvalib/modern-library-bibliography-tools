<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>It is a matter of publishing history that two distinguished novels—<em>Of
Human Bondage</em> and <em>Maurice Guest</em>—have had an almost parallel fate.
Both were acclaimed by discriminating critics but at first met with an
apathetic public response. Years later they came into their own as two
of the most popular novels of our time. Today <em>Maurice Guest</em> is
ranked, among musical novels, with <em>Jean Christophe</em> and <em>Evelyn
Innes</em>, and has grown so steadily in esteem that it is surpassing
Henry Handel Richardson’s best-selling novel, <em>Ultima Thule</em>. (<em>Fall
1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by P. R. Reynolds, 1908, and Duffield &amp;
Co., 1909, probably using printed sheets or duplicate plates of the
English edition published by William Heinemann, 1908. New
bibliographical edition published by W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1930. ML
edition (pp. [1]–566) printed from Norton plates. Published October
1936. <em>WR</em> 31 October 1936. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.
Discontinued 1 January 1940.</p>
<p>A ML edition of <em>Maurice Guest</em> was suggested by at least two people.
The ML’s traveler for the Middle West passed along a bookseller’s
suggestion for the novel (James L. Crowder to Cerf, 1 October 1934), and
W. W. Norton appears to have suggested a ML reprint. Cerf expressed
reservations about its sales potential: “May I ask you on what terms you
will be prepared to let us publish MAURICE GUEST in the Modern Library
this Fall? I agree with you that it is a fine book, but am a little
doubtful as to just how big a seller it would be” (Cerf to Walter
Norton, W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2 January 1936).</p>
<p>Henry Handel Richardson was the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay
Richardson. Commins identified the author as Henrietta Richardson in the
first draft of his biographical note and indicated that “Handel” had
been taken from the name of the composer. Norton asked Cerf to omit the
reference since neither Norton nor Heinemann, her English publisher, had
ever made Richardson’s identity public. He also pointed out that she had
been married for over thirty years to an important figure in English
letters (the philologist John George Robertson) and was no longer Miss
Richardson (Norton to Cerf, 28 July 1936). Commins left in the reference
to “Miss Richardson” but omitted information about to her real name.</p>
<p>The ML edition was not a success. Copies of the first printing have been
seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.</p>

Years later they came into their own as two\n> of the most popular novels of our time. Today *Maurice Guest* is\n> ranked, among musical novels, with *Jean Christophe* and *Evelyn\n> Innes*, and has grown so steadily in esteem that it is surpassing\n> Henry Handel Richardson’s best-selling novel, *Ultima Thule*. (*Fall\n> 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by P. R. Reynolds, 1908, and Duffield &\nCo., 1909, probably using printed sheets or duplicate plates of the\nEnglish edition published by William Heinemann, 1908. New\nbibliographical edition published by W. W. Norton & Co., 1930. ML\nedition (pp. \\[1\\]–566) printed from Norton plates. Published October\n1936. *WR* 31 October 1936. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1940.\n\nA ML edition of *Maurice Guest* was suggested by at least two people.\nThe ML’s traveler for the Middle West passed along a bookseller’s\nsuggestion for the novel (James L. Crowder to Cerf, 1 October 1934), and\nW. W. Norton appears to have suggested a ML reprint. Cerf expressed\nreservations about its sales potential: “May I ask you on what terms you\nwill be prepared to let us publish MAURICE GUEST in the Modern Library\nthis Fall? I agree with you that it is a fine book, but am a little\ndoubtful as to just how big a seller it would be” (Cerf to Walter\nNorton, W. W. Norton & Co., 2 January 1936).\n\nHenry Handel Richardson was the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay\nRichardson. Commins identified the author as Henrietta Richardson in the\nfirst draft of his biographical note and indicated that “Handel” had\nbeen taken from the name of the composer. Norton asked Cerf to omit the\nreference since neither Norton nor Heinemann, her English publisher, had\never made Richardson’s identity public. He also pointed out that she had\nbeen married for over thirty years to an important figure in English\nletters (the philologist John George Robertson) and was no longer Miss\nRichardson (Norton to Cerf, 28 July 1936). Commins left in the reference\nto “Miss Richardson” but omitted information about to her real name.\n\nThe ML edition was not a success. Copies of the first printing have been\nseen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.",
