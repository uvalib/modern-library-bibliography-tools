<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“ECCE HOMO” is a fitting summary of Nietzsche’s character as a man and
his achievement as a thinker. “The Birth of Tragedy” is one of the
most difficult of his works to obtain in an adequate translation. Both
are presented here complete and unabridged.</p>
<p>Nietzsche’s other most important works may be obtained in Modern
Library editions. “Thus Spake Zarathustra” is Volume Number 9, “Beyond
Good and Evil” is Number 20, and “The Genealogy of Morals” is Number
62. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Ecce Homo</em> is a summary of Friedrich Nietzsche’s philosophy and his
most robust affirmation of life. In these respects it is a spiritual
and intellectual autobiography that proclaims with vigorous emphasis
the virtues of strength and pride. The juxtaposition of <em>Ecce Homo</em>
and <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> in one volume gains significance by
opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is
dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many
of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (<em>Fall
1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML translation. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the
four Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as <em>The
Philosophy of Nietzsche</em> (G32).</p>
<p>After discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s <em>Dawn of Day</em> with
Macmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted <em>Ecce Homo</em> instead.
They hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England
and offered an advance of $200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They
asked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance
that Macmillan would not put <em>Ecce Homo</em> into its series of inexpensive
reprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr.,
Macmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent
firm in London but the response was slow in coming.</p>
<p>After waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their
own translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of
Columbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended
Horace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss
indicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer
than they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of
his graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of
<em>Ecce Homo</em> and <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> and to submit the manuscript by 6
December.</p>
<p>Approval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in
mid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with
Fadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October
1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but
in time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition
of <em>Ecce Homo &amp; The Birth of Tragedy</em> was the first time Fadiman’s name
was attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, 22 May 1943, p.
37).</p>

The juxtaposition of *Ecce Homo*\n> and *The Birth of Tragedy* in one volume gains significance by\n> opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is\n> dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many\n> of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (*Fall\n> 1933*)\n\nOriginal ML translation. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the\nfour Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as *The\nPhilosophy of Nietzsche* (G32).\n\nAfter discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s *Dawn of Day* with\nMacmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted *Ecce Homo* instead.\nThey hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England\nand offered an advance of $200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They\nasked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance\nthat Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive\nreprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr.,\nMacmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent\nfirm in London but the response was slow in coming.\n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their\nown translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of\nColumbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended\nHorace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss\nindicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer\nthan they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of\nhis graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of\n*Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6\nDecember.\n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in\nmid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with\nFadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October\n1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but\nin time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition\nof *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* was the first time Fadiman’s name\nwas attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 22 May 1943, p.\n37).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (1917–) 9<br>\nNietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* (1917–1936) 28<br>\nNietzsche, *Genealogy of Morals* (1918–1936) 59<br>\nNietzsche, *Philosophy* (Giant, 1937–1970) G32<br>\nNietzsche, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1968–) G113<br>",
