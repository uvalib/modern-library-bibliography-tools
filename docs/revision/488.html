<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>The Greek Commonwealth</em> is a vivid account of Athens during its
Golden Age—the time of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and
Aristophanes, of Pericles and Themistocles, of Herodotus and
Thucydides, of Socrates and Protagoras. It was the time, too, in which
art and architecture reached unsurpassed heights: the time of the
Parthenon and Acropolis.</p>
<p>In few periods of human history have so much achievement, so much
creative genius, so much epochal decision been concentrated as in
fifth-century Athens. No understanding of the Western heritage is
complete without knowledge of this stirring hour in the history of
mankind. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in England by Clarendon Press, 1911; 5th ed.
published by Oxford University Press, 1931. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Published October 1956. <em>WR</em> 5
November 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The ML paid Oxford University Press royalties of 7½ cents a copy on all
copies sold in the U.S. and 7½ percent of the net sums received on all
copies sold at export. Stein told Cerf that <em>The Greek Commonwealth</em> was
“one of the classic works on Greek history. This is an account of Athens
during the fifth century when art, poetry and drama reached their
highest state. Although it is primarily a political and economic
account, it seems to me to be one of the clearest pictures of Greece in
its finest day” (Stein memo to Cerf, 10 June 1955). Stein also talked to
Klopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford
University Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered
that we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’s <em>The Greek
Commonwealth</em> and we should like very much to include it in the Modern
Library” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955).</p>
<p>An internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with
Oxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transfer <em>The
Greek Commonwealth</em> to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A
decision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in
as small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don
Singer, 19 November 1968).</p>

(*Fall 1956*)\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in medium gray (265) moderate pink (5), deep blue\n(179) and black on coated white paper with illustration of Ionic column\nin moderate pink, title in deep blue, author in reverse, other lettering\nin black and moderate pink, all against dappled medium gray background.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> *The Greek Commonwealth* is a vivid account of Athens during its\n> Golden Age—the time of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and\n> Aristophanes, of Pericles and Themistocles, of Herodotus and\n> Thucydides, of Socrates and Protagoras. It was the time, too, in which\n> art and architecture reached unsurpassed heights: the time of the\n> Parthenon and Acropolis.\n>\n> In few periods of human history have so much achievement, so much\n> creative genius, so much epochal decision been concentrated as in\n> fifth-century Athens. No understanding of the Western heritage is\n> complete without knowledge of this stirring hour in the history of\n> mankind. (*Fall 1956*)\n\nOriginally published in England by Clarendon Press, 1911; 5th ed.\npublished by Oxford University Press, 1931. ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Published October 1956. *WR* 5\nNovember 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe ML paid Oxford University Press royalties of 7½ cents a copy on all\ncopies sold in the U.S. and 7½ percent of the net sums received on all\ncopies sold at export. Stein told Cerf that *The Greek Commonwealth* was\n“one of the classic works on Greek history. This is an account of Athens\nduring the fifth century when art, poetry and drama reached their\nhighest state. Although it is primarily a political and economic\naccount, it seems to me to be one of the clearest pictures of Greece in\nits finest day” (Stein memo to Cerf, 10 June 1955). Stein also talked to\nKlopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford\nUniversity Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered\nthat we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’s *The Greek\nCommonwealth* and we should like very much to include it in the Modern\nLibrary” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955).\n\nAn internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with\nOxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transfer *The\nGreek Commonwealth* to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A\ndecision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in\nas small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don\nSinger, 19 November 1968).",
