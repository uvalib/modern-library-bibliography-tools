<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The play, based on Erskine Caldwell’s novel, <em>Tobacco Road</em>, was the
most phenomenally successful production in the history of the American
theatre. The novel itself has been one of the most widely read and
discussed books of our time. Whatever controversies it has aroused,
there has been no difference of opinion about its power and
excitement. As the chronicler of the folkways of the impoverished
South, Erskine Caldwell has re-created a world and a people with
courageous realism. He has given us, in <em>Tobacco Road</em>, a novel of
extraordinary appeal and merit. (<em>Spring 1947</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
<em>Tobacco Road</em> is one of the most widely read and discussed books of
our time. Brilliantly realistic in its picture of moral and physical
decay among the impoverished sharecroppers and tenant farmers of the
South, this novel has been universally acclaimed for its high literary
merit and for its socially significant viewpoint. Throughout the book
there runs a skillfully drawn thread of rich humor, imparting to the
reader a sympathetic understanding of the shocking state in which many
Americans still live.</p>
<p>Erskine Caldwell has long been regarded as one of our foremost
writers, and most readers would give <em>Tobacco Road</em> a prominent place
in the list of his writings. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1932; rights
subsequently transferred to Duell, Sloan and Pearce. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–241) printed from Scribner/Duell, Sloan and Pearce plates except
for “After Ten Years” (pp. [<em>7–9</em>]) which was not in Scribner
printings. Publication announced for February 1947. <em>WR</em> 17 May 1947.
First printing: Not established. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The reprint agreement for the ML edition was signed in May 1945 with
publication scheduled for spring 1947 (Cerf to Charles Duell, 20
September 1946). The contract for the ML edition of Howard Fast’s <em>The
Unvanquished</em> (379), which appeared in fall 1945, was signed at the same
time. Details are not available about the advance paid by the ML or the
initial royalty rate; in the 1960s the ML was paying royalties of 15
cents a copy.</p>
<p>Caldwell’s preface “After Ten Years” originally appeared in the 1940
edition published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce with black-and-white
illustrations by David Fredenthal.</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted
that the retail price of ML books had increased since 1947 and inquired
whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown,
17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12
cents a copy.</p>

The novel itself has been one of the most widely read and\n> discussed books of our time. Whatever controversies it has aroused,\n> there has been no difference of opinion about its power and\n> excitement. As the chronicler of the folkways of the impoverished\n> South, Erskine Caldwell has re-created a world and a people with\n> courageous realism. He has given us, in *Tobacco Road*, a novel of\n> extraordinary appeal and merit. (*Spring 1947*)\n\n> Front flap revised:<br>\n> *Tobacco Road* is one of the most widely read and discussed books of\n> our time. Brilliantly realistic in its picture of moral and physical\n> decay among the impoverished sharecroppers and tenant farmers of the\n> South, this novel has been universally acclaimed for its high literary\n> merit and for its socially significant viewpoint. Throughout the book\n> there runs a skillfully drawn thread of rich humor, imparting to the\n> reader a sympathetic understanding of the shocking state in which many\n> Americans still live.\n>\n> Erskine Caldwell has long been regarded as one of our foremost\n> writers, and most readers would give *Tobacco Road* a prominent place\n> in the list of his writings. (*Spring 1957*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1932; rights\nsubsequently transferred to Duell, Sloan and Pearce. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–241) printed from Scribner/Duell, Sloan and Pearce plates except\nfor “After Ten Years” (pp. \\[*7–9*\\]) which was not in Scribner\nprintings. Publication announced for February 1947. *WR* 17 May 1947.\nFirst printing: Not established. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nThe reprint agreement for the ML edition was signed in May 1945 with\npublication scheduled for spring 1947 (Cerf to Charles Duell, 20\nSeptember 1946). The contract for the ML edition of Howard Fast’s *The\nUnvanquished* (379), which appeared in fall 1945, was signed at the same\ntime. Details are not available about the advance paid by the ML or the\ninitial royalty rate; in the 1960s the ML was paying royalties of 15\ncents a copy.\n\nCaldwell’s preface “After Ten Years” originally appeared in the 1940\nedition published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce with black-and-white\nillustrations by David Fredenthal.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted\nthat the retail price of ML books had increased since 1947 and inquired\nwhether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown,\n17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12\ncents a copy.\n\n",
