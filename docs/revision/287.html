<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in dark blue (183) and dark brown (59) on cream
paper with a facsimile of Newton’s bookplate depicting Temple Bar with a
quotation from Samuel Johnson: “Sir, the biographical part of literature
is what I love most”; borders in dark blue, lettering in dark brown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
One need not be an expert to partake with A. Edward Newton in the most
fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every
ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince
among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded
his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of
<em>The Amenities of Book-Collecting</em> made it the unanimous choice of the
editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to
be welcomed into the series. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression
published by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>],
[<em>16</em>]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from
the sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a
black-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the
Atlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and
printed with the text. Published December 1935. <em>WR</em> 14 December 1935.
First printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to <em>The Amenities of
Book-Collecting</em> when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was
still selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to
Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24
August 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just
returned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we
had a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that
time I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library
edition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to
you and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about
it” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he
would be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25
February 1935).</p>
<p>The Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf
initially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he
wanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750
against royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay
only 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after
which the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to
McIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think
that Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure
that every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale
of at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the
book is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the
pages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).</p>
<p>Cerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the
$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset
“would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result
may not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough
to suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The
Polygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the
plates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work,
including all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints
(make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408
for 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).</p>
<p>Newton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf
invited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant
not only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but
special attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words,
the new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new
review of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to
Newton, 25 April 1935).</p>

Edward Newton in the most\n> fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every\n> ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince\n> among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded\n> his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of\n> *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* made it the unanimous choice of the\n> editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to\n> be welcomed into the series. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression\npublished by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\],\n\\[*16*\\]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from\nthe sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a\nblack-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the\nAtlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and\nprinted with the text. Published December 1935. *WR* 14 December 1935.\nFirst printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.\n\nCerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to *The Amenities of\nBook-Collecting* when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was\nstill selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to\nAlfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24\nAugust 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just\nreturned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we\nhad a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that\ntime I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library\nedition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to\nyou and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about\nit” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he\nwould be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25\nFebruary 1935).\n\nThe Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf\ninitially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he\nwanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay\nonly 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after\nwhich the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to\nMcIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think\nthat Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure\nthat every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale\nof at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the\nbook is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the\npages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).\n\nCerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the\n$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset\n“would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result\nmay not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough\nto suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The\nPolygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the\nplates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work,\nincluding all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints\n(make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408\nfor 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).\n\nNewton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf\ninvited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant\nnot only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but\nspecial attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words,\nthe new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new\nreview of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to\nNewton, 25 April 1935).",
