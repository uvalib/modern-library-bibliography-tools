<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Thoroughly characteristic of its splendidly gifted and barbarically
untameable author are these autobiographical memoirs—a production of
the utmost energy, directness and racy animation, setting forth one of
the most singular careers in all the annals of fine art. Cellini’s
amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the
sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and
self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is
impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and
fascinating books in existence. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial without horizontal borders or rules in black on
pale blue (185) paper with inset illustration of a man with sword facing
a woman at left. Signed: Davidson. (<em>Spring 1929</em>) <em>Note:</em> Used on
copies sold as part of Three Renaissance Romances gift box, Christmas

<p><em>Jacket D:</em> Pictorial in moderate blue (182) and black on cream paper
with inset illustration as jacket B; borders in moderate blue, lettering
in black. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of all the great personalities of the Renaissance, none more
completely embodies the bold and sumptuous period than Benvenuto
Cellini. His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble,
is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for
almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a
life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate
creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its
untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the
autobiographies of the world. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket E:</em> Pictorial in dark grayish blue (187), light gray (264),
medium gray (265), black and gold on coated white paper with inset
black-and-white illustration shaded in light and medium gray of a man
and woman embracing with Florentine rooftops in background; title and
translator in reverse against dark grayish blue background, decorations
in gold. Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. Front flap as
132a jacket D. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>

Cellini’s\n> amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the\n> sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and\n> self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is\n> impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and\n> fascinating books in existence. (*Spring 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial without horizontal borders or rules in black on\npale blue (185) paper with inset illustration of a man with sword facing\na woman at left. Signed: Davidson.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Of all the great personalities of the Renaissance, none more\n> completely embodies the bold and sumptuous period than Benvenuto\n> Cellini. His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble,\n> is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for\n> almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a\n> life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate\n> creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its\n> untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the\n> autobiographies of the world. (*Fall 1934*)\n\n*Jacket E:* Pictorial in dark grayish blue (187), light gray (264),\nmedium gray (265), black and gold on coated white paper with inset\nblack-and-white illustration shaded in light and medium gray of a man\nand woman embracing with Florentine rooftops in background; title and\ntranslator in reverse against dark grayish blue background, decorations\nin gold.
