<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
RICHARD FEVEREL is the first, as it is doubtless the favorite, of the
astonishing succession of novels which placed Meredith among the
demigods of English literature. Its essential theme is the question of
a boy’s education, and the abortive attempt of a proud and opinionated
father, hide-bound by theory and precept, to bring up his son through
a system which controls all his early circumstances and represses many
of the natural and wholesome impulses of adolescence.</p>
<p>The Modern Library reprints RICHARD FEVEREL from the first edition of
the book, retaining all the passages written in the full glow and
vigor of his prime, that Meredith excised in some of the later
editions of the book. (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in moderate yellow green (120) and black on cream
paper depicting a young man earnestly clasping the hand of a young woman
standing by a garden turnstile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Enthusiasts for the novels of George Meredith stand firm in their
preference for <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>. Unanimously they agree
that this study of adolescence is more than a penetrating
psychological document; it is a vivid and absorbing dramatization of
the conflict between two generations, made memorable by a glowing
passion. After the first edition of <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>,
several passages, essential to its full appreciation, were deleted.
These have been entirely restored in the Modern Library version.
(<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>

(*Fall 1931*)\n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.\n\n> Text on front:<br>\n> RICHARD FEVEREL is the first, as it is doubtless the favorite, of the\n> astonishing succession of novels which placed Meredith among the\n> demigods of English literature. Its essential theme is the question of\n> a boy’s education, and the abortive attempt of a proud and opinionated\n> father, hide-bound by theory and precept, to bring up his son through\n> a system which controls all his early circumstances and represses many\n> of the natural and wholesome impulses of adolescence.\n>\n> The Modern Library reprints RICHARD FEVEREL from the first edition of\n> the book, retaining all the passages written in the full glow and\n> vigor of his prime, that Meredith excised in some of the later\n> editions of the book. (*Fall 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*)\n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in moderate yellow green (120) and black on cream\npaper depicting a young man earnestly clasping the hand of a young woman\nstanding by a garden turnstile.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Enthusiasts for the novels of George Meredith stand firm in their\n> preference for *The Ordeal of Richard Feverel*. Unanimously they agree\n> that this study of adolescence is more than a penetrating\n> psychological document; it is a vivid and absorbing dramatization of\n> the conflict between two generations, made memorable by a glowing\n> passion. After the first edition of *The Ordeal of Richard Feverel*,\n> several passages, essential to its full appreciation, were deleted.\n> These have been entirely restored in the Modern Library version.\n> (*Spring 1935*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for September 1927. *WR* 5 November 1927. First printing: Not\nascertained.
