<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial on cream paper printed in grayish yellow green
(105) with title in ornamental lettering in deep orange (51), very dark
green (147), and moderate greenish blue (173); subtitle and author in
script lettering in very dark green and moderate greenish blue. Adapted
from Ernst Reichl’s jacket for the original RH edition. The original
jacket is signed “REICHL” in sans-serif capitals along the lower right
margin. The reduction in size of the ML jacket is achieved by cropping
the side and lower margins, resulting in the omission of his name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
When this volume first appeared in 1934 under the Random House
imprint, William Saroyan’s meteoric flight across the literary skies
was begun. For a book of short stories, it had an unprecedented
success and was an augury of his continuing national fame. Since then
William Saroyan has maintained his position among the foremost writers
of America. Winner of the Drama Critics Circle award and also winner,
but scorner, of the Pulitzer Prize for <em>The Time of Your Life</em>, he has
achieved quite as sensational a name for himself in the field of the
drama as in the short story. (<em>Spring 1941</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1934. ML edition (pp. [vii–x],
9–270) printed from RH plates with running heads removed to accommodate
the ML’s smaller format and with page numerals 7–8 removed from the
table of contents, which was revised to include Saroyan’s preface to the
ML edition. Published January 1941. <em>WR</em> 25 January 1941. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948.</p>
<p><em>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em> was one of the first trade
titles published by Random House. Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to
design trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the
plates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such
as the removal of running heads.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May
1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML
titles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the
ML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was
out of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print
and that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to
Saroyan, 5 April 1949).</p>

(*Spring 1941*)\n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial on cream paper printed in grayish yellow green\n(105) with title in ornamental lettering in deep orange (51), very dark\ngreen (147), and moderate greenish blue (173); subtitle and author in\nscript lettering in very dark green and moderate greenish blue. Adapted\nfrom Ernst Reichl’s jacket for the original RH edition. The original\njacket is signed “REICHL” in sans-serif capitals along the lower right\nmargin. The reduction in size of the ML jacket is achieved by cropping\nthe side and lower margins, resulting in the omission of his name.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> When this volume first appeared in 1934 under the Random House\n> imprint, William Saroyan’s meteoric flight across the literary skies\n> was begun. For a book of short stories, it had an unprecedented\n> success and was an augury of his continuing national fame. Since then\n> William Saroyan has maintained his position among the foremost writers\n> of America. Winner of the Drama Critics Circle award and also winner,\n> but scorner, of the Pulitzer Prize for *The Time of Your Life*, he has\n> achieved quite as sensational a name for himself in the field of the\n> drama as in the short story. (*Spring 1941*)\n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1934. ML edition (pp. \\[vii–x\\],\n9–270) printed from RH plates with running heads removed to accommodate\nthe ML’s smaller format and with page numerals 7–8 removed from the\ntable of contents, which was revised to include Saroyan’s preface to the\nML edition. Published January 1941. *WR* 25 January 1941. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948.\n\n*The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* was one of the first trade\ntitles published by Random House. Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to\ndesign trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the\nplates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such\nas the removal of running heads.\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May\n1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML\ntitles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the\nML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was\nout of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print\nand that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to\nSaroyan, 5 April 1949).",
