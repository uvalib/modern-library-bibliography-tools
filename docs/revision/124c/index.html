<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
In the little more than one hundred years since <em>Moby Dick</em> was first
published, critics have probed its inexhaustible symbolic treasures.
The general reader has also found great wealth as he participated in
the hunt for the white whale. He encountered an adventure story of
magnificent sweep and suspense. From its incomparably effective
opening sentence, “Call me Ishmael,” to its dramatic end when the
white whale triumphs and all hands, except Ishmael, perish, Melville
makes everyone—the reader most of all—share Captain Ahab’s obsessive
belief that he alone can destroy the white, evil leviathan. <em>Moby
Dick</em> is more than a tale of the pursuit of a monster; it is an
allegory of relentless hatred and evil redeemed by man’s indomitable
courage. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Fujita pictorial jacket in deep blue (179), deep reddish
orange (36) and black on coated white paper with inset wood engraving of
whale destroying a whaling boat; lettering in deep blue, deep reddish
orange and black, all against white background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“<em>Moby Dick</em> possesses an unusual, if not unique, literary form which
cannot be compared to that of the conventional novel, drama or travel
book. It is a realistic story of life aboard a whaling vessel, a
romance of adventure and strange characters, a drama of heroic
determination and conflict and a technical treatise on whaling. . . .
Because of its unconventional complexity, it is a disturbing
book. . . . Like all great books, <em>Moby Dick</em> has the potentiality of
enriching itself with the substance of each new reader’s emotions and
ideas, and it has grown greater in its implications with the passage
of time.” —from the Introduction by Leon Howard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published with the Howard introduction in MLCE (1950) and
subsequently in the regular ML. Professor Austin Warren of the
University of Michigan was originally invited to write the introduction.
He agreed to a deadline of 30 March and a $200 fee but withdrew two days
before it was due, pleading illness and expressing dissatisfaction with
the fee compared to the royalty offered by the competing series Rinehart
Editions (Albert Erskine to Warren, 26 January 1950; Warren to Erskine,
28 March 1950). Erskine turned to Leon Howard, then at Northwestern
University, who agreed to write the introduction for the $200 fee
(Erskine to Howard, 31 March 1950).</p>
<p>Melville’s dedication to Nathaniel Hawthorne, omitted from earlier ML
printings, is included in 124c.</p>

He encountered an adventure story of\n> magnificent sweep and suspense. From its incomparably effective\n> opening sentence, “Call me Ishmael,” to its dramatic end when the\n> white whale triumphs and all hands, except Ishmael, perish, Melville\n> makes everyone—the reader most of all—share Captain Ahab’s obsessive\n> belief that he alone can destroy the white, evil leviathan. *Moby\n> Dick* is more than a tale of the pursuit of a monster; it is an\n> allegory of relentless hatred and evil redeemed by man’s indomitable\n> courage. (*Fall 1954*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita pictorial jacket in deep blue (179), deep reddish\norange (36) and black on coated white paper with inset wood engraving of\nwhale destroying a whaling boat; lettering in deep blue, deep reddish\norange and black, all against white background.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> “*Moby Dick* possesses an unusual, if not unique, literary form which\n> cannot be compared to that of the conventional novel, drama or travel\n> book. It is a realistic story of life aboard a whaling vessel, a\n> romance of adventure and strange characters, a drama of heroic\n> determination and conflict and a technical treatise on whaling. . . .\n> Because of its unconventional complexity, it is a disturbing\n> book. . . . Like all great books, *Moby Dick* has the potentiality of\n> enriching itself with the substance of each new reader’s emotions and\n> ideas, and it has grown greater in its implications with the passage\n> of time.” —from the Introduction by Leon Howard\n\nOriginally published with the Howard introduction in MLCE (1950) and\nsubsequently in the regular ML. Professor Austin Warren of the\nUniversity of Michigan was originally invited to write the introduction.\nHe agreed to a deadline of 30 March and a $200 fee but withdrew two days\nbefore it was due, pleading illness and expressing dissatisfaction with\nthe fee compared to the royalty offered by the competing series Rinehart\nEditions (Albert Erskine to Warren, 26 January 1950; Warren to Erskine,\n28 March 1950). Erskine turned to Leon Howard, then at Northwestern\nUniversity, who agreed to write the introduction for the $200 fee\n(Erskine to Howard, 31 March 1950).\n\nMelville’s dedication to Nathaniel Hawthorne, omitted from earlier ML\nprintings, is included in 124c.\n\n",
