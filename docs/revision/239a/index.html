<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
A band of pirates captures a vessel bound for England that contains a
miscellaneous cargo—including a group of children who have been driven
from their home by a West Indian hurricane. The difficulties
encountered by the well-meaning buccaneers with these incredible
children provide the frame-work for one of the most unusual books in
the Modern Library series—a shocking, nerve-tingling story that the
reader will never forget. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. as <em>The Innocent Voyage</em> by Harper &amp; Bros.,
1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July
1932. <em>WR</em> 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1
January 1958.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated
interest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his
personal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself
have bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros.,
5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk
about a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September
1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he
stated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in
the Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and
I have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the
author’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint
contract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a
warm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the
Modern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is
released” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).</p>
<p>When the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed
Klopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the
Readers Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s
president, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was
available (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and
convinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail
order sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would
like to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the
option to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer
to Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty
remained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed
in 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but
without an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the
ML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club
edition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).</p>
<p>In 1956 the College Department of Harper &amp; Bros. expressed interest in
adding <em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> and Richard Wright’s <em>Native Son</em> (349)
to the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper
director of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the
ML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had
textbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer
replied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition
from an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department
wants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the
Modern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to
Rose, 25 July 1956).</p>
<p><em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and
Giant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles
in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952.</p>

(*Spring 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros.,\n1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July\n1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1958.\n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated\ninterest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his\npersonal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself\nhave bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros.,\n5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk\nabout a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September\n1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he\nstated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in\nthe Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and\nI have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the\nauthor’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint\ncontract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a\nwarm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the\nModern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is\nreleased” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).\n\nWhen the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed\nKlopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the\nReaders Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s\npresident, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was\navailable (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and\nconvinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail\norder sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would\nlike to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the\noption to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer\nto Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty\nremained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed\nin 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but\nwithout an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the\nML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club\nedition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).\n\nIn 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in\nadding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349)\nto the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper\ndirector of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the\nML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had\ntextbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer\nreplied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition\nfrom an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department\nwants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the\nModern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to\nRose, 25 July 1956).\n\n*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles\nin the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952.\n\n",
