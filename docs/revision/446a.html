<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Ben Jonson considered John Donne the first among the poets of his
time. That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been
reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life
ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St.
Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons
which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily
wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by
Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry
and a generous selection of his prose. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s <em>Complete Poetry
and Selected Prose</em>, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed
from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. <em>WR</em> 5
April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from
Nonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein
to Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The
ML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore
more economical to print.</p>
<p><em>The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne</em> was originally
scheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition
was postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of
$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an
additional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.
Stein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in
the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a
number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being
carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John
Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they
have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high
for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College
Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue
getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a
disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production
aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever
before. (Stein to Coffin, 15 May 1951)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A volume of Donne’s <em>Poetry and Prose</em>, ed. Frank J. Warnke, finally
appeared in MLCE in 1967.</p>

That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been\n> reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life\n> ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St.\n> Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons\n> which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily\n> wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by\n> Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry\n> and a generous selection of his prose. (*Spring 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s *Complete Poetry\nand Selected Prose*, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed\nfrom plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. *WR* 5\nApril 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from\nNonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein\nto Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The\nML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore\nmore economical to print.\n\n*The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne* was originally\nscheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition\nwas postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of\n$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an\nadditional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.\nStein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:\n\n> There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in\n> the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a\n> number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being\n> carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John\n> Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they\n> have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high\n> for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College\n> Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue\n> getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a\n> disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production\n> aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever\n> before. (Stein to Coffin, 15 May 1951)\n\nA volume of Donne’s *Poetry and Prose*, ed. Frank J. Warnke, finally\nappeared in MLCE in 1967.\n\n",
