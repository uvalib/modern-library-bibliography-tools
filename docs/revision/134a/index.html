<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Joseph Conrad wrote of W. H. Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow
gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it
there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was
not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose
steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of
the sea at sunrise.</p>
<p>The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the
model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast
savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly
innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters,
who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads,
golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is
gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these
pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (<em>Spring
1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a
naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, <em>The Purple Land</em>
retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality
of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide
savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of
greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys
the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. <em>The
Purple Land</em> is a companion volume in the Modern Library to <em>Green
Mansions</em> (No. 89.) (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets
of the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American
edition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore
Roosevelt (Payne, p. 17). ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949.</p>
<p>Cerf offered McFee $50 to write the introduction to <em>The</em> <em>Purple Land</em>
and also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially
<em>Captain Macedoine’s Daughter</em>, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August
1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> (223)
was published in the ML in 1931.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Purple Land</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it
67th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October
1943 it was at the bottom of the third quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales.</p>

Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow\n> gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it\n> there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was\n> not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose\n> steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of\n> the sea at sunrise.\n>\n> The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the\n> model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast\n> savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly\n> innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters,\n> who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads,\n> golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is\n> gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these\n> pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (*Spring\n> 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a\n> naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, *The Purple Land*\n> retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality\n> of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide\n> savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of\n> greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys\n> the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. *The\n> Purple Land* is a companion volume in the Modern Library to *Green\n> Mansions* (No. 89.) (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets\nof the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American\nedition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore\nRoosevelt (Payne, p. 17). ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949.\n\nCerf offered McFee $50 to write the introduction to *The* *Purple Land*\nand also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially\n*Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August\n1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s *Casuals of the Sea* (223)\nwas published in the ML in 1931.\n\nSales of *The Purple Land* during the first six months of 1928 placed it\n67th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October\n1943 it was at the bottom of the third quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales.\n\n",
