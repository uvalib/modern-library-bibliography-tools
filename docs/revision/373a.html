title in reverse and brilliant yellow against moderate greenish blue
orb; “EDITED BY BENNETT CERF” in moderate greenish blue, “A MODERN

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Deep in the heart of every human being, no matter how rational or
sceptical, there lurks a fascination for the weird and occult.
Disbelief does not lay ghosts, nor do the tests of science exorcise
them. Stairs creak in the dark with the tread of unseen visitors;
cemeteries send up midnight apparitions; and headless horsemen ride in
the moonlight.</p>
<p>In this completely revised edition of <em>Famous Ghost Stories</em>, Bennett
Cerf has included such classics of the supernatural as “The Beckoning
Fair One,” “The Willows,” “The Supper at Elsinore,” and “The Phantom
Rickshaw.” (<em>Fall 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Front flap reset with the following phrase added to the last sentence:</p>
<p>“and many other tales of terror and ghostly phenomena.” (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket B1:</em> Fujita non-pictorial jacket in deep yellow (85), strong
purplish red (255) and black on coated white paper; “Famous” in deep
yellow, “Ghost” in reverse, “Stories” in strong purplish red, and other
lettering in reverse.</p>
<p>Front and back flaps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps no literary genre has as valid a claim to time-proven
distinction as the ghost story; from the ages when men huddled around
a fire and exchanged tales to hold back the night, to this day when
science is beginning to probe the reaches of man’s mind, the ghost
story has held a place of honorable speculation. Whether we scoff or
believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling
fascination.</p>
<p>Bennett Cerf introduces this selection of notable ghost stories that
reflect the best of the form. Included are such shiveringly famous
tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return
of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard
Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home,
Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that
confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human
imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Best Ghost Stories</em> (67), which had
been in the ML since 1919. Publication announced for spring 1944. <em>WR</em> 5
August 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf commented in <em>SRL</em>: “Ever since I have had anything to do with the
Modern Library, it has included one anthology which struck me as several
degrees below par, and that is its collection of ghost stories. This
summer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume.
The first step in this process, duly recognized by the International
Order of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb
through all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of
numerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library
archives” (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, 28 August 1943, p. 17).</p>
<p>Eleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the
anthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a
flat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4
cents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Famous Ghost Stories</em> (IML 17) was also published in the Illustrated
Modern Library (1946) with illustrations by Hugo Steiner-Prag and
William Sharp.</p>

Whether we scoff or\n> believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling\n> fascination.\n>\n> Bennett Cerf introduces this selection of notable ghost stories that\n> reflect the best of the form. Included are such shiveringly famous\n> tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return\n> of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard\n> Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home,\n> Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that\n> confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human\n> imagination.\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Best Ghost Stories* (67), which had\nbeen in the ML since 1919. Publication announced for spring 1944. *WR* 5\nAugust 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nCerf commented in *SRL*: “Ever since I have had anything to do with the\nModern Library, it has included one anthology which struck me as several\ndegrees below par, and that is its collection of ghost stories. This\nsummer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume.\nThe first step in this process, duly recognized by the International\nOrder of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb\nthrough all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of\nnumerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library\narchives” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 28 August 1943, p. 17).\n\nEleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the\nanthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a\nflat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4\ncents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy.\n\n*Famous Ghost Stories* (IML 17) was also published in the Illustrated\nModern Library (1946) with illustrations by Hugo Steiner-Prag and\nWilliam Sharp.\n\n",
