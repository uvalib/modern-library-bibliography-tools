extending between the third and fourth words of the imprint] | THE
MODERN LIBRARY NEW YORK. <em>Note:</em> The ML title page has an intrusive
black mark between the “<em>N</em>” and “<em>I</em>” of the title that does not appear
to have been removed in later printings.</p>

<em>First Modern Library Edition, 1959</em> | <em>Copyright, 1948, 1949, 1950,

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Pick up this book and start reading a story, any story. Choose from
intriguing titles like “A Perfect Day for Bananafish” or “For
Esmé—With Love and Squalor,” and start anywhere. Chances are that you
will be in on a conversation, one so fresh and immediate that you will
seem to be hearing, not reading it. You have entered the world of
J. D. Salinger, and you will continue reading until you have finished
all nine stories. Who are these extraordinary people, these grave and
knowing children, what is happening to them, what are they revealing
about past events, about themselves, about their dealings with each
other and the world? The author does not tell you directly but you
find out for yourself from their every word, gesture, and act.</p>
<p>When you have finished, you will understand why Arthur Mizener
recently called Salinger “probably the most avidly read author of any
serious pretensions in his generation,” and his work “the most
interesting fiction that has come along for some time.” (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1953. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–302) printed from Little, Brown plates with decorative rules
removed from table of contents, fly title and chapter heads in all
printings of 516a. Published September 1959. <em>WR</em> 28 September 1959.
First printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65.</p>
<p>Cerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped <em>Nine Stories</em> could be
included in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He
subsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint <em>The</em> <em>Catcher in
the Rye</em> (504) and <em>Nine Stories</em> in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger
asked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the
entry for <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the
president of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal
notice that termination of the <em>Nine Stories</em> contract would become
effective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to
dispose of any copies on hand.</p>
<p>The Little, Brown half title (<em>Nine Stories</em>) is sandwiched between two
decorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “<em>by</em>
J. D. <span class="smallcaps">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The
ML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | <em>OF THE WORLD’S
BEST BOOKS</em> followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line
statement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated
folder listing each volume in the series.</p>
<p>Printings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960),
15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing
in spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of <em>Nine Stories</em> are
included in the entry for <em>The</em> <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> (1958: 504).</p>
<p>The ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s
books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering
hope that Salinger might change his mind. <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and <em>Nine
Stories</em> were listed in <em>Publishers’ Trade List Annual</em> through 1965 and
continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through
1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new
titles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of <em>Nine
Stories</em>, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when
<em>Renaissance Philosophy</em>, vol. 2*: The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611)
was published as ML 301*.*</p>

ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–302) printed from Little, Brown plates with decorative rules\nremoved from table of contents, fly title and chapter heads in all\nprintings of 516a. Published September 1959. *WR* 28 September 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65.\n\nCerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped *Nine Stories* could be\nincluded in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He\nsubsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint *The* *Catcher in\nthe Rye* (504) and *Nine Stories* in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger\nasked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the\nentry for *The Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the\npresident of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal\nnotice that termination of the *Nine Stories* contract would become\neffective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to\ndispose of any copies on hand.\n\nThe Little, Brown half title (*Nine Stories*) is sandwiched between two\ndecorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “*by*\nJ. D. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The\nML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | *OF THE WORLD’S\nBEST BOOKS* followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line\nstatement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated\nfolder listing each volume in the series.\n\nPrintings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960),\n15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing\nin spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of *Nine Stories* are\nincluded in the entry for *The* *Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504).\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of *Nine\nStories*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when\n*Renaissance Philosophy*, vol. 2*: The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611)\nwas published as ML 301*.*\n\n",
