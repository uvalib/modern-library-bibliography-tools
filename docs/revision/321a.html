(163), very light greenish blue (171) and black on coated white paper
with three diagonal brick-like panels tilting to the upper right with

titles of the six plays in black on light bluish green panel tilting
toward the lower right, all against woven background pattern in moderate

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the Spring of 1935, when <em>Waiting for Lefty</em> was first produced by
the Group Theatre, a new force made itself felt in the American drama.
Since then Clifford Odets has extended and solidified his reputation
as the most brilliant playwright of the younger generation. Each of
his plays reveals an impressive development of his dramatic gifts.
This volume includes all his work to date in their complete texts:
<em>Waiting for Lefty</em>, <em>Awake and Sing</em>, <em>Till the Day I Die</em>, <em>Paradise
Lost</em>, <em>Golden Boy</em> and <em>Rocket to the Moon</em>. (<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection; published simultaneously in a Random House trade
edition at $2.50. Published September 1939. <em>WR</em> 9 September 1939. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1972/73.</p>
<p>Cerf told Odets in 1938, “I consider you and O’Neill the two most
important playwrights in America” (Cerf to Odets, 19 May 1938). Both
were Random House authors.</p>
<p>The trade edition of <em>Six Plays of Clifford Odets</em> was published
primarily for sale to libraries. The same plates except for the half
title and title page were used for printings of the ML and trade
editions. The plates were designed for the ML’s larger format that was
introduced in fall 1939; they would have been too large for the ML’s
balloon cloth format that remained in use through spring 1939.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 4,819 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1
November 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not
among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Both\nwere Random House authors.\n\nThe trade edition of *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* was published\nprimarily for sale to libraries. The same plates except for the half\ntitle and title page were used for printings of the ML and trade\neditions. The plates were designed for the ML’s larger format that was\nintroduced in fall 1939; they would have been too large for the ML’s\nballoon cloth format that remained in use through spring 1939.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,819 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not\namong the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952.\n\n",
