<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
No new method of writing has been more discussed in the last decade
than Mr. Joyce’s so-called “stream of consciousness technique”; in
this novel, which was published in 1915, he handled this method for
the first time on a large scale.</p>
<p>Herbert Gorman, in his introduction to this edition of “A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man” says: “So profound and beautiful and
convincing a book is part of the lasting literature of our age, and if
it is overshadowed by the huger proportions and profundities of
“Ulysses,” we must still remember that out of it that vaster tome
evolved and that in it is the promise of that new literature, new both
in form and content, that will be the classics of tomorrow.” (<em>Spring
1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, after the
ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s epoch-making decision,
lends importance to the Modern Library edition of <em>A Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man</em>. This earlier autobiographical novel is a
prelude to <em>Ulysses</em>, and it makes clear the method and the scope of
the latter work. As the first novel to employ the stream of
consciousness technique, <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
created a revolution in modern fiction. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in book form by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, and from 1925
by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [<em>1</em>]–299) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title.
Published March 1928. <em>WR</em> 7 April 1928. First printing: 8,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p><em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> was the ML’s thirteenth
best-selling title during the first six months of 1928. During the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was at the bottom of the
first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It slipped into the second
quarter of ML titles during the 12-month period November 1951–October
1952 but sold 1,200 more copies on an annual basis than it had in
1942–43. There were thirty-eight ML printings by May 1950 for a total of
99,000 copies (Slocum and Cahoon, pp. 18–19).</p>
<p>Viking Press published <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> in its
quality paperback series, Compass Books, in August 1956. Viking Press
appears to have canceled the ML’s reprint contract in anticipation of
the Compass edition and allowed the ML to sell out its existing stock.</p>

(*Fall 1931*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s *Ulysses*, after the\n> ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s epoch-making decision,\n> lends importance to the Modern Library edition of *A Portrait of the\n> Artist as a Young Man*. This earlier autobiographical novel is a\n> prelude to *Ulysses*, and it makes clear the method and the scope of\n> the latter work. As the first novel to employ the stream of\n> consciousness technique, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*\n> created a revolution in modern fiction. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published in book form by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, and from 1925\nby Viking Press. ML edition (pp. \\[*1*\\]–299) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title.\nPublished March 1928. *WR* 7 April 1928. First printing: 8,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1956.\n\n*A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* was the ML’s thirteenth\nbest-selling title during the first six months of 1928. During the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was at the bottom of the\nfirst quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It slipped into the second\nquarter of ML titles during the 12-month period November 1951–October\n1952 but sold 1,200 more copies on an annual basis than it had in\n1942–43. There were thirty-eight ML printings by May 1950 for a total of\n99,000 copies (Slocum and Cahoon, pp. 18–19).\n\nViking Press published *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in its\nquality paperback series, Compass Books, in August 1956. Viking Press\nappears to have canceled the ML’s reprint contract in anticipation of\nthe Compass edition and allowed the ML to sell out its existing stock.\n\n",
