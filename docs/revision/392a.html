<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Beethoven, the man and the creator, emerges in all his humanity and
genius from the pages of this book. The events of his life and the
circumstances under which he wrote his majestic music are presented
with the purpose of giving the general reader a faithful portrait. In
addition, more than one hundred of the works are analyzed so that the
concertgoer, phonograph enthusiast and the radio listener will have
program notes, with appraisals and interpretations. The author, John
N. Burk, is the historian of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. (<em>Fall
1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1943. ML edition (pp. v–483)
printed from RH plates with frontispiece portrait of Beethoven omitted.
Publication announced for November 1946. <em>WR</em> 14 December 1946. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Burk was a music historian affiliated with the Boston Symphony. His
program notes about works being performed were included in the printed
programs, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on
Boston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’s
<em>Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography</em> in 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf
and Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins
suggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and
one-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works
(Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by
Random House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML
edition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000
copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter.</p>
<p><em>The Life and Works of Beethoven</em> was not among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952. It sold about 2,000 copies a year in the mid-1950s;
Cerf reported in 1960 that it sold “only moderately well” (Cerf to
Selden Rodman, 8 June 1960).</p>
<p>Burk indicated that his typescript was almost exactly 100,000 words and
that his first choice of someone to write an introduction was Aaron
Copeland, with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony,
as another possibility (Burk to Commins, 13 July 1942 and 27 November
1942; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library). In the
end the book was published without an introduction.</p>

(*Fall 1946*) *Note:* *First* statement retained on\nspring 1948 printing.\n\n*Jacket A:* Pictorial on coated white paper with inset drawing of\nBeethoven in deep red (16), brilliant yellow (83), medium gray (265) and\nblack on coated white paper, with title in deep red on white banner\nabove drawing of Beethoven, other lettering in deep red and black at\nfoot; background in black ruled in medium gray at top and white ruled in\nblack at foot. The front panel is a reduced version of the 1943 Random\nHouse jacket with “Modern Library Edition” added at the foot.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Beethoven, the man and the creator, emerges in all his humanity and\n> genius from the pages of this book. The events of his life and the\n> circumstances under which he wrote his majestic music are presented\n> with the purpose of giving the general reader a faithful portrait. In\n> addition, more than one hundred of the works are analyzed so that the\n> concertgoer, phonograph enthusiast and the radio listener will have\n> program notes, with appraisals and interpretations. The author, John\n> N. Burk, is the historian of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. (*Fall\n> 1946*)\n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1943. ML edition (pp. v–483)\nprinted from RH plates with frontispiece portrait of Beethoven omitted.\nPublication announced for November 1946. *WR* 14 December 1946. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nBurk was a music historian affiliated with the Boston Symphony. His\nprogram notes about works being performed were included in the printed\nprograms, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on\nBoston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’s\n*Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography* in 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf\nand Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins\nsuggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and\none-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works\n(Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by\nRandom House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML\nedition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000\ncopies and 10 cents a copy thereafter.\n\n*The Life and Works of Beethoven* was not among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952. It sold about 2,000 copies a year in the mid-1950s;\nCerf reported in 1960 that it sold “only moderately well” (Cerf to\nSelden Rodman, 8 June 1960).\n\nBurk indicated that his typescript was almost exactly 100,000 words and\nthat his first choice of someone to write an introduction was Aaron\nCopeland, with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony,\nas another possibility (Burk to Commins, 13 July 1942 and 27 November\n1942; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library). In the\nend the book was published without an introduction.\n\n",
