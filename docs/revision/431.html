<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Louisa May Alcott’s hope that <em>Little Women</em> would become “the most
tattered, dog-eared, best-loved book in the library” has been more
than fulfilled through the decades following its publication in 1868.
Generation after generation, young people and their elders have read
and reread the adventures of the March family, admired Jo’s daring,
wept when Beth died and sighed sympathetically over Meg’s and Amy’s
romantic adventures. Those who remember their youth and want to renew
it keep a special place in their hearts for this nostalgic tale of a
vanished time and spirit in American life. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
fall 1950. <em>WR</em> 30 September 1950. First printing: 6,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1955.</p>
<p><em>Little Women</em> with illustrations by Albert de Mee Jousset was
originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library
in fall 1947. Jousset received $2,000 for the artwork, which included
color illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings
ranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on
pages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly
before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the
Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both
<em>Little Women</em> and Parkman’s <em>Oregon Trail</em>, the other Illustrated
Modern Library title announced for fall 1947.</p>
<p>At this point the type for <em>Little Women</em> was in galleys (the text was
set from the edition published in Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior
Library), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed,
and all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two
years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish <em>Little Women</em>
in the regular ML without color illustrations. <em>The Oregon Trail</em> (423)
was also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket
of <em>Little Women</em> is unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color
illustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library.</p>
<p>The ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second
printing in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued.</p>

Those who remember their youth and want to renew\n> it keep a special place in their hearts for this nostalgic tale of a\n> vanished time and spirit in American life. (*Fall 1950*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nfall 1950. *WR* 30 September 1950. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1955.\n\n*Little Women* with illustrations by Albert de Mee Jousset was\noriginally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library\nin fall 1947. Jousset received $2,000 for the artwork, which included\ncolor illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings\nranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on\npages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly\nbefore escalating production costs forced the suspension of the\nIllustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both\n*Little Women* and Parkman’s *Oregon Trail*, the other Illustrated\nModern Library title announced for fall 1947.\n\nAt this point the type for *Little Women* was in galleys (the text was\nset from the edition published in Grosset & Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior\nLibrary), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed,\nand all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two\nyears until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *Little Women*\nin the regular ML without color illustrations. *The Oregon Trail* (423)\nwas also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket\nof *Little Women* is unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color\nillustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library.\n\nThe ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second\nprinting in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued.",
