<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“In ‘The Sea and the Jungle’ we have surely one of the great
achievements of maritime narrative. There need be no fatuous
comparisons. Sometimes they are useful as a label for the instruction
of those who must have things expressed in terms of what they know
already. But in speaking of this book, that has earned its right to
stand among the most thoughtful of our time, we can be absolute. The
author’s own casual phrase will serve, ‘This is a travel book for
honest men.’ Beneath the sheer beauty of the writing you will find
that plain virtue, that honesty, that fidelity to the ungainly fact.”
— <em>Christopher Morley</em> (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>C:</em> Pictorial in light green (144) and black on cream paper
with inset illustration of a man making his way through jungle foliage;
lettering in black, borders in light green. Signed: Loederer. (<em>Fall
1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
From the moment H. M. Tomlinson, caught and caged by the city, watched
the Putney bus take on a casual passenger, and then the Skipper
himself, until the <em>Capella</em> made port from Pará and the Madeira
jungle, this book spreads a tapestry of pictures and places,
adventures and yarns, and talk of great things and little in the sure
accents of truth. <em>The Sea and the Jungle</em> is more than a travel book
or a maritime narrative; it is writing of sheer beauty, unswerving
fidelity and scrupulous honesty. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton Co., 1913, using sheets of
the English edition published by Duckworth. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1928. <em>WR</em> 17
March 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.</p>
<p><em>The Sea and the Jungle</em> appears to have been in the U.S. public domain
because of its original publication in the U.S using imported sheets.
The ML paid royalties directly to Tomlinson.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Sea and the Jungle</em> during the first six months of 1928
placed it 15th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms
of sales.</p>

(*Spring 1930*)\n\n*Jacket* *C:* Pictorial in light green (144) and black on cream paper\nwith inset illustration of a man making his way through jungle foliage;\nlettering in black, borders in light green. Signed: Loederer. (*Fall\n1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> From the moment H. M. Tomlinson, caught and caged by the city, watched\n> the Putney bus take on a casual passenger, and then the Skipper\n> himself, until the *Capella* made port from Pará and the Madeira\n> jungle, this book spreads a tapestry of pictures and places,\n> adventures and yarns, and talk of great things and little in the sure\n> accents of truth. *The Sea and the Jungle* is more than a travel book\n> or a maritime narrative; it is writing of sheer beauty, unswerving\n> fidelity and scrupulous honesty. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton Co., 1913, using sheets of\nthe English edition published by Duckworth. ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1928. *WR* 17\nMarch 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.\n\n*The Sea and the Jungle* appears to have been in the U.S. public domain\nbecause of its original publication in the U.S using imported sheets.\nThe ML paid royalties directly to Tomlinson.\n\nSales of *The Sea and the Jungle* during the first six months of 1928\nplaced it 15th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms\nof sales.\n\n",
