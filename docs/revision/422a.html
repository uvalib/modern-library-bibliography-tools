<p>Front flap:<br>
The growing representation of the world’s great philosophers in the
Modern Library is in response to the insistent demand of readers of
the series. <em>The Philosophy of Kant</em> now becomes a companion volume to
those books which include the basic writings of such philosophers as
Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Confucius, Laotse, Schopenhauer,
Pascal, William James, John Dewey, Friedrich Nietzsche, Bertrand
Russell, Bergson, Santayana and others. For this work, Professor Carl
Friedrich contributes a brilliant interpretive introduction to the
twelve essays in this volume, chosen to convey the essence of Kant’s
metaphysical thought. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

purplish red (258) on coated white paper. (<em>Mid 1960s</em>)</p>

orange yellow (67) and black on coated white paper with lettering in

brilliant orange yellow and black. Backstrip in vivid red with lettering
in reverse and black.</p>
<p>Front and back flaps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Modern Library edition offers a basic selection of Immanuel
Kant’s writings on the metaphysics of morality and politics. Here, a
series of lucid translations enables the reader to appreciate Kant’s
towering importance as an ethical and social thinker and to understand
his enduring influence on the shape of philosophy. The twelve essays
in this volume have been carefully arranged by Professor Carl J.
Friedrich to represent the range of Kant’s most essential writings.</p>
<p>Professor Friedrich has contributed an original essay for this volume
in the form of a brilliant interpretive Introduction which places
Kant, the philosopher and the man, in his time and timelessness.</p>
<p>A note about Kant’s special relevance today: “Indeed, the problem of
freedom, the freedom of the human personality to unfold and fulfill
its higher destiny, is the central issue of all of Kant’s
philosophizing” —from the Introduction. (<em>Spring 1967 format</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML original collection. Published December 1949. <em>WR</em> 21 January 1950.
First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Friedrich received a $750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy.
At first he planned to include selections from <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>
but wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly
as I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very
unsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure
Reason.” He suggested omitting <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> altogether and
including fuller extracts from the <em>Prolegomena</em> (Friedrich to Commins,
14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page
selection from the Introduction to <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> was
included. The ML published an abridged edition of <em>Critique of Pure
Reason</em> in 1958 (506).</p>
<p>Friedrich wrote Commins that he thought that <em>The Philosophy of Kant</em>
was a misleading title since large parts of the <em>Critique</em> were not
included. He suggested calling the book <em>Introduction to Kant</em> or
<em>Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy</em> (Friedrich to Commins,
20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had
already been announced. He argued that <em>The Philosophy of Kant</em> did not
misrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but
he offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to
Friedrich, 25 July 1949).</p>
<p>When he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest
editor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12
October 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).</p>
<p>Sales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950.</p>

Here, a\n> series of lucid translations enables the reader to appreciate Kant’s\n> towering importance as an ethical and social thinker and to understand\n> his enduring influence on the shape of philosophy. The twelve essays\n> in this volume have been carefully arranged by Professor Carl J.\n> Friedrich to represent the range of Kant’s most essential writings.\n>\n> Professor Friedrich has contributed an original essay for this volume\n> in the form of a brilliant interpretive Introduction which places\n> Kant, the philosopher and the man, in his time and timelessness.\n>\n> A note about Kant’s special relevance today: “Indeed, the problem of\n> freedom, the freedom of the human personality to unfold and fulfill\n> its higher destiny, is the central issue of all of Kant’s\n> philosophizing” —from the Introduction. (*Spring 1967 format*)\n\nML original collection. Published December 1949. *WR* 21 January 1950.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\nFriedrich received a $750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy.\nAt first he planned to include selections from *Critique of Pure Reason*\nbut wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly\nas I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very\nunsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure\nReason.” He suggested omitting *Critique of Pure Reason* altogether and\nincluding fuller extracts from the *Prolegomena* (Friedrich to Commins,\n14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page\nselection from the Introduction to *Critique of Pure Reason* was\nincluded. The ML published an abridged edition of *Critique of Pure\nReason* in 1958 (506).\n\nFriedrich wrote Commins that he thought that *The Philosophy of Kant*\nwas a misleading title since large parts of the *Critique* were not\nincluded. He suggested calling the book *Introduction to Kant* or\n*Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy* (Friedrich to Commins,\n20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had\nalready been announced. He argued that *The Philosophy of Kant* did not\nmisrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but\nhe offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to\nFriedrich, 25 July 1949).\n\nWhen he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest\neditor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12\nOctober 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).\n\nSales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950.\n\n",
