Giants list. (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>
<p>In 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern
Library College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a
list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently
cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not
include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the
near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College
Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year
as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be
incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to
Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.</p>
<p>Stein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously
bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML
consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s
translation of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,
Letters</em> (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably
the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3
November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.
If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition
of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Essays</em> in 1958, may
not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.</p>

(*Fall 1960*)\n\nIn 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern\nLibrary College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a\nlist of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently\ncut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not\ninclude the publication of this book in the College Editions within the\nnear future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College\nEditions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year\nas we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be\nincorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to\nBates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.\n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously\nbad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML\nconsider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s\ntranslation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,\nLetters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably\nthe definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3\nNovember 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.\nIf he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition\nof Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s *Complete Essays* in 1958, may\nnot have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Florio translation (1933–1945) G10.1\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Trechmann translation (1946–1948) G10.2",
