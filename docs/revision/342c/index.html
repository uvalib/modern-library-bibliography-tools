<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No philosopher has had as profound an influence on the history of
Western thought as Plato, and perhaps no one work has shaped our
conception of the ideal society as much as Plato’s <em>Republic</em>. The
most important of the Socratic dialogues, the <em>Republic</em> is concerned
with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place
as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the
word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes
various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But
above all, the <em>Republic</em> is an attempt to define “justice”; by
imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to
see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows
himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.</p>
<p>The text used here is the classic Jowett translation, complete and
unabridged, with notes and marginalia for the student, scholar, and
general reader alike.</p>

The\n> most important of the Socratic dialogues, the *Republic* is concerned\n> with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place\n> as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the\n> word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes\n> various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But\n> above all, the *Republic* is an attempt to define “justice”; by\n> imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to\n> see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows\n> himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.\n>\n> The text used here is the classic Jowett translation, complete and\n> unabridged, with notes and marginalia for the student, scholar, and\n> general reader alike.\n\nPublished fall 1982 at $7.95.
