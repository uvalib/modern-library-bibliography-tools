<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving
romance, <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>, have won acclaim from the critics,
support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators.
Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed,
athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love
story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s
strength. <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> is an exciting book, true to its time
and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp.
[v–vii], [1]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half
title used as a fly title. Published May 1932. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1932. First
printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.</p>
<p>The ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents
a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s <em>Sun Also Rises</em> (190). Cerf
initially hoped to publish <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> in September 1931 (Cerf
to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may
have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931
publication of Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford
in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and
indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January
1932).</p>
<p>There were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies
(July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March
1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling
14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111
copies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf
to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> sold 12,287
copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing
it sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of <em>The Sun
Also Rises</em>. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>
<p>Scribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more
vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of
the Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf,
29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that <em>A Farewell to
Arms</em> was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,
Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound
edition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.</p>

(*Spring 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving\n> romance, *A Farewell to Arms*, have won acclaim from the critics,\n> support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators.\n> Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed,\n> athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love\n> story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s\n> strength. *A Farewell to Arms* is an exciting book, true to its time\n> and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp.\n\\[v–vii\\], \\[1\\]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half\ntitle used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.\n\nThe ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf\ninitially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf\nto Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may\nhave been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931\npublication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford\nin Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and\nindicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January\n1932).\n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies\n(July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March\n1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling\n14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111\ncopies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf\nto Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *A Farewell to Arms* sold 12,287\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing\nit sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of *The Sun\nAlso Rises*. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of\nthe Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf,\n29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *A Farewell to\nArms* was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nedition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.\n\n",
