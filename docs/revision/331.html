<p>Front flap:<br>
The editors of this volume were guided entirely by the principle of
clarifying for the modern American reader all the obscurities of the
Bible in its standard forms. They have emphasized the religious and
literary qualities of the Book of books, and have made it easy to read
and understand. The historical background of each book is traced in
simple and succinct commentaries, and the very arrangement of the
books themselves, in the probable order of their writing, throws new
light on the development of religious thought. <em>The Short Bible</em> is a
boon to those who seek its essential truth and beauty. (<em>Fall 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by University of Chicago Press, 1933. ML edition
(pp. v–[549]) printed from University of Chicago Press plates.
Published September 1940. <em>WR</em> 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000
copies. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p><em>The Short Bible</em> was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed
to secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s <em>The Complete Bible:
An American Translation</em> (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they
wanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a $5,000 advance for <em>The
Complete Bible</em> ($3,000 on signing and $2,000 one year after
publication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think
we could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to
Donald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the
University of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of <em>The Complete
Bible</em> was premature, Cerf offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of
10 cents a copy for <em>The Short Bible</em> (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939).
Shortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean
to run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became
Acting Manager of the Press.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting <em>The Complete
Bible</em>. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with
Goodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the
complete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to
the Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf
Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from
California he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and
Goodspeed had decided against a ML edition of <em>The Short Bible</em>. He
reported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . .
you and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up
the Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until
we can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant
edition of the <em>Complete Bible</em>. I told him that we both understand full
well that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but
if we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to
guarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of
our contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December
1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).</p>
<p>Lewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead
with <em>The Short Bible</em>. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell
well, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML
rejected it, and that whichever firm got <em>The Short Bible</em> would have a
“toe-hold” on <em>The Complete Bible</em>. He recommended that the ML secure
<em>The Short Bible</em> on the understanding that it would get <em>The Complete
Bible</em> if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and
Klopfer’s concern that a ML edition of <em>The Short Bible</em> might injure
their chances of getting <em>The Complete Bible</em> if it sold poorly but
concluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23
February 1940).</p>
<p>Cerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three
days later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for
<em>The Short Bible</em> was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After
signing Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a
reprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given
the first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this
edition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).</p>
<p>Two years later Cerf offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10
cents a copy for reprint rights to <em>The Complete Bible</em>. Hemens replied
that it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be
different the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to
Cerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that
many readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have
the complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really
impressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). <em>The Complete
Bible</em> never appeared in the ML.</p>
<p>The text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted
and abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago
Press jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and
appealing than that of the original edition.</p>
<p>The ML edition of <em>The Short Bible</em> sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942
and 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There
was a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional
printings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and
printings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January
1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November
1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML
titles.</p>

They have emphasized the religious and\n> literary qualities of the Book of books, and have made it easy to read\n> and understand. The historical background of each book is traced in\n> simple and succinct commentaries, and the very arrangement of the\n> books themselves, in the probable order of their writing, throws new\n> light on the development of religious thought. *The Short Bible* is a\n> boon to those who seek its essential truth and beauty. (*Fall 1940*)\n\nOriginally published by University of Chicago Press, 1933. ML edition\n(pp. v–\\[549\\]) printed from University of Chicago Press plates.\nPublished September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\n*The Short Bible* was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed\nto secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s *The Complete Bible:\nAn American Translation* (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they\nwanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a $5,000 advance for *The\nComplete Bible* ($3,000 on signing and $2,000 one year after\npublication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think\nwe could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to\nDonald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the\nUniversity of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of *The Complete\nBible* was premature, Cerf offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of\n10 cents a copy for *The Short Bible* (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939).\nShortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean\nto run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became\nActing Manager of the Press.\n\nCerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting *The Complete\nBible*. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with\nGoodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the\ncomplete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to\nthe Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf\nPapers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from\nCalifornia he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and\nGoodspeed had decided against a ML edition of *The Short Bible*. He\nreported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . .\nyou and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up\nthe Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until\nwe can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant\nedition of the *Complete Bible*. I told him that we both understand full\nwell that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but\nif we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to\nguarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of\nour contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December\n1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).\n\nLewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead\nwith *The Short Bible*. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell\nwell, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML\nrejected it, and that whichever firm got *The Short Bible* would have a\n“toe-hold” on *The Complete Bible*. He recommended that the ML secure\n*The Short Bible* on the understanding that it would get *The Complete\nBible* if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and\nKlopfer’s concern that a ML edition of *The Short Bible* might injure\ntheir chances of getting *The Complete Bible* if it sold poorly but\nconcluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23\nFebruary 1940).\n\nCerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three\ndays later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for\n*The Short Bible* was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After\nsigning Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a\nreprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given\nthe first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this\nedition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).\n\nTwo years later Cerf offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy for reprint rights to *The Complete Bible*. Hemens replied\nthat it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be\ndifferent the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to\nCerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that\nmany readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have\nthe complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really\nimpressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). *The Complete\nBible* never appeared in the ML.\n\nThe text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted\nand abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago\nPress jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and\nappealing than that of the original edition.\n\nThe ML edition of *The Short Bible* sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942\nand 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There\nwas a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional\nprintings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and\nprintings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January\n1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML\ntitles.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*The Holy Bible*, illus.
