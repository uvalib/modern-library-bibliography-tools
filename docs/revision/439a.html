<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The glory that was Greece is ours for the reading. Here is the rich
heritage from the golden age of the drama. The tragedies of Aeschylus,
Sophocles, Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes are timeless.
Today, as it was twenty-five centuries ago, the insight of these
dramatists into the spirit of man and his relationship to nature, to
society and to his own soul is deeply rewarding and stirring. The
seven plays in this volume are unmatched in all the literature of the
drama for intensity and magnitude and boisterous humor. (<em>Spring
1951</em>)</p>

(<em>Fall 1955</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Four Famous Greek Plays</em>, ed. Paul
Landis (1929: 178). Contents drawn from <em>The Complete Greek Drama</em>, ed.
Oates and O’Neill in the Lifetime Library (2 vols., Random House, 1938).
Published spring 1951. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular
ML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted that
<em>Four Famous Greek Plays</em> (178) would have to be completely revised. He
told Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the
Modern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart
Edition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In
addition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more
specifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we
prepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based
upon the Lifetime Library [Random House] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK
DRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give
the College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted that
<em>Seven Famous Greek Plays</em> would differ from the Rinehart anthology in
the following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have
Euripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally
desirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’
Lysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I
think for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do
not.”</p>
<p>Stein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library
edition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he
indicated that the use of these translations would depend on the
permission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit
the ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions
that prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the
general introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein
concluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book
available for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of
July 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1
February 1950).</p>
<p>Oates received a flat fee of $200 for his general introduction to Greek
tragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a
flat fee of $100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the
introduction to <em>The Frogs</em>. Permission fees included $100 each for
Aldington’s translation of <em>Alcestis</em> and Murray’s translation of <em>The
Frogs</em>; More’s translation of <em>Prometheus Bound</em> appears to have
required a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional $100
when <em>Seven Famous Greek Plays</em> was added to the regular ML (Commins to
Oates, 28 June 1951).</p>

(*Spring\n> 1951*)\n\n*Jacket B1:* Non-pictorial in dark blue (183), vivid red (11) and black\non coated white paper with collective title in reverse against white\npanel at top lined in black and larger dark blue panel below the foot\nwith titles of individual plays in reverse against vivid red bars,\ntorchbearer and series in vivid red, other lettering in reverse against\ndark blue background except. Signed: RIKI. Front flap as jacket A.\n(*Fall 1955*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Four Famous Greek Plays*, ed. Paul\nLandis (1929: 178). Contents drawn from *The Complete Greek Drama*, ed.\nOates and O’Neill in the Lifetime Library (2 vols., Random House, 1938).\nPublished spring 1951. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71.\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular\nML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted that\n*Four Famous Greek Plays* (178) would have to be completely revised. He\ntold Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the\nModern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart\nEdition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In\naddition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more\nspecifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we\nprepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based\nupon the Lifetime Library \\[Random House\\] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK\nDRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give\nthe College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted that\n*Seven Famous Greek Plays* would differ from the Rinehart anthology in\nthe following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have\nEuripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally\ndesirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’\nLysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I\nthink for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do\nnot.”\n\nStein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library\nedition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he\nindicated that the use of these translations would depend on the\npermission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit\nthe ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions\nthat prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the\ngeneral introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein\nconcluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book\navailable for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of\nJuly 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1\nFebruary 1950).\n\nOates received a flat fee of $200 for his general introduction to Greek\ntragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a\nflat fee of $100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the\nintroduction to *The Frogs*. Permission fees included $100 each for\nAldington’s translation of *Alcestis* and Murray’s translation of *The\nFrogs*; More’s translation of *Prometheus Bound* appears to have\nrequired a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional $100\nwhen *Seven Famous Greek Plays* was added to the regular ML (Commins to\nOates, 28 June 1951).\n\n",
