<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In his lifetime Ring Lardner was briefly described as a writer of
humorous dialect, a baseball satirist and generally a funny fellow.
This injustice to his reputation has been completely revised since his
death by a new estimate of his place among the world’s great
story–tellers. Now he is as much admired for his vigor and warmth and
unfailing sense of the dramatic as for his irrepressible humor. *The
Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner—*thirty-five in all—represent,
in John Chamberlain’s opinion, “The full measure of the talent of the
man who is pre-eminently our best short story writer.” (<em>Fall 1941</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except in black, vivid orange (48), light yellow
(86) and gold with inset panel in black instead of vivid orange. (<em>Fall
1944</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published as <em>Round Up: The Stories of Ring W. Lardner</em> by
Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. vii–467) printed from
Scribner plates with fly title omitted. Published November 1941. <em>WR</em> 8
November 1941. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p>The ML paid Scribner’s a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy. Cerf had tried to get Lardner’s stories for the ML on several
occasions before Scribner’s agreed to a reprint edition. He noted in
spring 1941 when he requested permission to include the book in the
fall, “It is a glaring omission on our list and it has been commented on
so many times that I am getting tired of hearing it” (Cerf to Max
Perkins, 1 May 1941). There was a second printing of 4,000 copies in
March 1942 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in January 1943.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,800 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1
November 1943, placing it in the first quarter of regular ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

(*Fall 1941*)\n\n*Jacket* *A:* Non-pictorial in vivid orange (48), light yellow (86) and\ngold on coated cream paper with lettering in reverse on inset vivid\norange panel and three vivid orange bands below the inset panel, all\nsurrounded by cream background with decorations in light yellow and\ngold; spine in gold with lettering in black. Designed by Paul Galdone,\nunsigned. *Note:* The jacket design in different color combinations was\nalso used in fall 1941 for *Five Great Modern Irish Pla*ys (339), fall\n1942 for *Collected Short Stories of Dorothy Parker* (353), and for four\nexisting ML anthologies when they appeared in the ML’s larger format in\nthe early 1940s: *Best Ghost Stories* (1919: 67b), *Best American\nHumorous Short Stories* (1920: 80f), *Great Modern Short Stories* (1930:\n188b), and *Great German Short Novels and Stories* (1933: 256b).\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> In his lifetime Ring Lardner was briefly described as a writer of\n> humorous dialect, a baseball satirist and generally a funny fellow.\n> This injustice to his reputation has been completely revised since his\n> death by a new estimate of his place among the world’s great\n> story–tellers. Now he is as much admired for his vigor and warmth and\n> unfailing sense of the dramatic as for his irrepressible humor. *The\n> Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner—*thirty-five in all—represent,\n> in John Chamberlain’s opinion, “The full measure of the talent of the\n> man who is pre-eminently our best short story writer.” (*Fall 1941*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except in black, vivid orange (48), light yellow\n(86) and gold with inset panel in black instead of vivid orange. (*Fall\n1944*)\n\nOriginally published as *Round Up: The Stories of Ring W. Lardner* by\nCharles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. vii–467) printed from\nScribner plates with fly title omitted. Published November 1941. *WR* 8\nNovember 1941. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy. Cerf had tried to get Lardner’s stories for the ML on several\noccasions before Scribner’s agreed to a reprint edition. He noted in\nspring 1941 when he requested permission to include the book in the\nfall, “It is a glaring omission on our list and it has been commented on\nso many times that I am getting tired of hearing it” (Cerf to Max\nPerkins, 1 May 1941). There was a second printing of 4,000 copies in\nMarch 1942 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in January 1943.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,800 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it in the first quarter of regular ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
