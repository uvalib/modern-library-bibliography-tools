<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“Twelve Men” shows, with a few unimportant breaks, a deliberate return
to Drieser’s first manner—the manner of pure representation, of
searching understanding, of unfailing gusto and contagious
wonderment. . . . Here are simply a dozen sketches of
character—rotund, brilliantly colored, absolutely alive. The thing is
done capitally, and, at its top points, superbly. <em>H. L. Mencken</em></p>
<p>In all these portraits there is that same sincere attempt to present
the men as they are—the modern Heliogabalus, and the modern ascetic,
the section boss, and the village patriarch. Here is wondrous,
inscrutable, fascinating life as revealed in the diversity of twelve
marionettes of the Great Impressario [<em>sic</em>]. It is one of the most
unusual books in our literature, and certainly one of the best books
that Dreiser has given us. <em>Burton Rascoe</em> (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1919. ML edition (pp.
[<em>1</em>]–360) printed from B&amp;L plates with contents page omitted.
Publication announced for June 1928. <em>WR</em> 4 August 1928. First (and
only) printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1934.</p>
<p>Cerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the
rights to <em>Twelve Men</em>. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of
$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October
1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for
royalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&amp;L for the
use of their plates. B&amp;L received $200 for approving the ML reprint;
this appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was
deducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received
$1,000 when the contract was signed.</p>
<p>Dreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the <em>New York Sun</em> (13
April 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken
$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but
Mencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis
to write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked <em>Twelve Men</em>
very much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf
to Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928).
Charles Merz of the <em>New York World</em> also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9
February 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou
of the <em>Chicago Daily News</em>, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought
to be doing this himself” (p. v).</p>
<p>Sales of the ML edition were disappointing. <em>Twelve Men</em> ranked 34th
among the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of
1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales
fell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser
file) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies
(1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421
copies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).</p>
<p>Several years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that
<em>Twelve Men</em> was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers,
Simon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability
to furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep
my works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me
without a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at
least, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf
explained why <em>Twelve Men</em> had been discontinued and added, “I believe
that one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained
popular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles
each year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit,
thereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their
keeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to
Dreiser, 10 April 1939).</p>

It is one of the most\n> unusual books in our literature, and certainly one of the best books\n> that Dreiser has given us. *Burton Rascoe* (*Spring 1928*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1932*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1919. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*1*\\]–360) printed from B&L plates with contents page omitted.\nPublication announced for June 1928. *WR* 4 August 1928. First (and\nonly) printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1934.\n\nCerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the\nrights to *Twelve Men*. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of\n$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October\n1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for\nroyalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&L for the\nuse of their plates. B&L received $200 for approving the ML reprint;\nthis appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was\ndeducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received\n$1,000 when the contract was signed.\n\nDreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the *New York Sun* (13\nApril 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken\n$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but\nMencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis\nto write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked *Twelve Men*\nvery much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf\nto Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928).\nCharles Merz of the *New York World* also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou\nof the *Chicago Daily News*, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought\nto be doing this himself” (p. v).\n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *Twelve Men* ranked 34th\namong the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of\n1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales\nfell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser\nfile) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies\n(1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421\ncopies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).\n\nSeveral years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that\n*Twelve Men* was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers,\nSimon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability\nto furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep\nmy works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me\nwithout a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at\nleast, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf\nexplained why *Twelve Men* had been discontinued and added, “I believe\nthat one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained\npopular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles\neach year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit,\nthereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their\nkeeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to\nDreiser, 10 April 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDreiser, *Free and Other Stories* (1924–1931) 106\n\nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932–1971) 230\n\nDreiser, *American Tragedy* (Giant, 1956–1968) G89",
