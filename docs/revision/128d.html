<p><em>Variant:</em> Pp. [<em>8</em>], 1–299 [300–312]. [1–10]<sup>16</sup>.

</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The original
text complete and unabridged, with a prologue by the author.” (<em>Spring
1929</em>) <em>Note:</em> The Prologue was not new to the ML edition; it had been
part of <em>Up Stream</em> since its original publication in 1922. The jacket
statement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the
introduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer
included.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative
life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. <em>Up Stream</em>
is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,
outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest
and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.
In the literature of America’s coming of age, <em>Up Stream</em> occupies a
unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final
declaration of creative independence. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the
ML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.
Lewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised <em>Up
Stream</em> for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after
those that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to
Ludwig Lewisohn in 1936 that <em>Up Stream</em> continued to sell at the rate
of 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time
that the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying
record” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).</p>
<p>Three other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. <em>A Modern Book of
Criticism</em> (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published
in spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. <em>The Story of
American Literature</em> (G43), originally published as <em>Expression in
America</em>, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to
lobby for the inclusion of his novel <em>The Island Within</em> shortly after
the Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the
series were “more than enough” but suggested that <em>Up Stream</em> might be
dropped and <em>The Island Within</em> published in its place. Lewisohn
approved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass
Canfield, Harper &amp; Bros., 12 October 1939). <em>The Island Within</em> (329)
sold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.</p>

The jacket\nstatement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the\nintroduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer\nincluded.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative\n> life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. *Up Stream*\n> is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,\n> outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest\n> and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.\n> In the literature of America’s coming of age, *Up Stream* occupies a\n> unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final\n> declaration of creative independence. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nThe fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the\nML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.\nLewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised *Up\nStream* for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after\nthose that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to\nLudwig Lewisohn in 1936 that *Up Stream* continued to sell at the rate\nof 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time\nthat the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying\nrecord” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).\n\nThree other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. *A Modern Book of\nCriticism* (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published\nin spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. *The Story of\nAmerican Literature* (G43), originally published as *Expression in\nAmerica*, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to\nlobby for the inclusion of his novel *The Island Within* shortly after\nthe Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the\nseries were “more than enough” but suggested that *Up Stream* might be\ndropped and *The Island Within* published in its place. Lewisohn\napproved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass\nCanfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939). *The Island Within* (329)\nsold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewisohn, ed., *A Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75\n\nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43\n\nLewisohn, *The Island Within* (1940–1942) 329",
