<blockquote>
<p>Captain Liddell Hart, whose <em>History of the World War</em> still holds the
field as the most brilliant analysis of the strategy and campaigns of
that conflict, has now compressed the complete story into 285 pages,
without the slightest sacrifice to accuracy or clarity. Read this
little book—refresh your memory—and get a new insight into the
present-day maneuvering of Europe’s war barons!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The complete story of the World War is here compressed into 285 pages
by the greatest military authority of our time. Without the slightest
sacrifice of accuracy or clarity, every campaign, every innovation,
every change of leadership of the entire conflict on land and sea and
in the air is covered completely. This volume is identical with the
original edition and includes the unabridged text, with full maps.
<em>The War in Outline</em> is even more than a history; it is also a
prophecy of what may happen during the war now threatening the world.
(<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1936. ML edition (pp. v–285)
printed from RH plates with list of maps on p. [xvii] revised to
reflect the omission of two folded maps and the use of a third map on
the endpapers. Published February 1939. <em>WR</em> 18 February 1939. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1946.</p>
<p><em>The War in Outline</em> was an abridgment of Liddell Hart’s <em>History of the
World War, 1914–1918</em> (Little, Brown, 1935), which was originally
published in 1930 as <em>The Real War</em> (Little, Brown, 1930). The
abridgment reduced the text from 635 to 285 pages.</p>
<p>When the RH edition of <em>The War in Outline</em> was published Cerf wrote to
Eugene O’Neill, who had lent him an earlier book by Liddell Hart: “I was
so deeply impressed by that book that I swore that one day we’d get
something by Hart [<em>sic</em>] for Random House. This is one time anyhow
that a dream came true!” (Cerf to O’Neill, 21 September 1936). Cerf does
not appear to have realized that Liddell Hart was a compound surname.
The author’s forenames, Basil Henry, were omitted from the title pages
of Random House and ML printings and also from the jacket, and <em>The War
in Outline</em> was entered under “Hart” in ML lists and catalogues.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 2,481 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,
placing it among the thirty worst-selling titles for that period. Random
House offered to sell the plates to Liddell Hart after the ML edition
was discontinued (Emanuel Harper to Liddell Hart, 31 October 1947).</p>

ML edition (pp. v–285)\nprinted from RH plates with list of maps on p. \\[xvii\\] revised to\nreflect the omission of two folded maps and the use of a third map on\nthe endpapers. Published February 1939. *WR* 18 February 1939. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1946.\n\n*The War in Outline* was an abridgment of Liddell Hart’s *History of the\nWorld War, 1914–1918* (Little, Brown, 1935), which was originally\npublished in 1930 as *The Real War* (Little, Brown, 1930). The\nabridgment reduced the text from 635 to 285 pages.\n\nWhen the RH edition of *The War in Outline* was published Cerf wrote to\nEugene O’Neill, who had lent him an earlier book by Liddell Hart: “I was\nso deeply impressed by that book that I swore that one day we’d get\nsomething by Hart \\[*sic*\\] for Random House. This is one time anyhow\nthat a dream came true!” (Cerf to O’Neill, 21 September 1936). Cerf does\nnot appear to have realized that Liddell Hart was a compound surname.\nThe author’s forenames, Basil Henry, were omitted from the title pages\nof Random House and ML printings and also from the jacket, and *The War\nin Outline* was entered under “Hart” in ML lists and catalogues.\n\nThe ML edition sold 2,481 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing it among the thirty worst-selling titles for that period. Random\nHouse offered to sell the plates to Liddell Hart after the ML edition\nwas discontinued (Emanuel Harper to Liddell Hart, 31 October 1947).\n\n",
