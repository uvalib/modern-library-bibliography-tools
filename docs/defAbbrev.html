    <h2>DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>anthology</strong>: A volume consisting of the works of multiple authors</p>
<p><strong>authorial paratext</strong>: <em>See</em> paratext.</p>
<p><strong>B&amp;L</strong>: Boni &amp; Liveright</p>
<p><strong>backstrip</strong>:  Portion of a book jacket that covers the spine and remainsnvisible when a book is shelved between other books. Backstrips of MLnjackets commonly displayed the title running vertically toward the footnor bottom of the jacket. Author’s names were usually displayednhorizontally at the top of the jacket, and the imprint “Modern Library”nappeared horizontally at the foot, along with a Modern Library device.nIt was also common for titles to be displayed horizontally. The only MLnjackets with titles running vertically toward the top were printed innEngland for the British publisher Hamish Hamilton, who imported a numbernof ML books in sheets in the late 1930s and sold them with tipped-inntitle pages and his own bindings and jackets.</p>
<p><strong>bibliographical edition</strong>: Bibliographers define all copies of a work printed from a givenntypesetting as part of the same edition. In the context of the ModernnLibrary, which printed all of its books from plates, an edition can bendefined as all copies of a work printed from plates made from the samentypesetting. In this bibliography the source of the plates used by thenML is always indicated; thereafter for the sake of convenience thisnbibliography uses the phrase “Modern Library edition” to refer tonfamilies of Modern Library printings made from the same plates.</p>
<p><strong>BOMC</strong>: Book-of-the-Month Club</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>.: Circa (approximately), used with dates. Example c. 1940</p>
<p><strong>cancel, cancellation</strong>: These terms refer to the removal of one or more leaves from a printed book, usually because of errors in the text, censorship, or othernlegal issues. Canceled leaves are often replaced by newly printednleaves with altered text. Single replacement leaves and inserted foldsnare usually pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf; insertedngatherings may be sewn in.</p>
<p>In the collation, canceled leaves are indicated by a minus sign; leavesnthat are canceled and replaced by newly printed leaves are indicated bynthe plus/minus sign (±). Leaves that are inserted/added without thencancellation of printed leaves are indicated by a plus sign. Cancelsnmade prior to publication are usually found in all copies of the firstnprinting. The first ML printing of Joyce, <em>Dubliners</em> (129.1a) appearsnto be an example of this. In all copies examined, the first leaf of thenintroduction to the ML edition has been cut out and replaced by a newlynprinted leaf.</p>
<p>Cancels made following publication are usually found in the portion ofnthe printing that remained in the publisher’s warehouse after thenproblem was discovered. See <em>Anthology of American Negro Literature</em>n(183.a).</p>
<p><strong>Cerf Papers</strong>: Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University Rare Book andnManuscript Library.</p>
<p><strong>cf</strong>.: Abbreviation for Latin <em>confer</em> (compare).</p>
<p><strong>chap</strong>.: Chapter</p>
<p><strong>cm</strong>: Centimeter or centimeters</p>
<p><strong>col</strong>.: Color</p>
<p><strong>collation</strong>:  Collation formula</p>
<p><strong>collection</strong>:  A volume consisting of multiple works by a single author</p>
<p><strong>conjunct</strong>: Two leaves that consist of a single piece of paper folded innhalf to form two leaves; a sheet printed in octavo format (8 leaves, 16npages) produces a gathering where the 1st and 8th leaves, the 2nd andn7th leaves, the 3rd and 6th leaves, and the 4th and 5th leaves arenconjunct.</p>
<p><strong>cont</strong>.: Continue</p>
<p>d<strong>©</strong>: International copyright symbol; transcribed in bibliographicalndescriptions when it appears as part of the copyright statement on thenverso of the title page.</p>
<p><strong>dates</strong>: The date of an event that extends over the course of two or morenyears is indicated with an en dash, for example 2006–07; the date of annevent that cannot be assigned to a specific year is dated as preciselynas possible using a slash, for example 2006/07. Approximate dates arenindicated by the abbreviation “c.” (circa).</p>
<p><strong>dating key</strong>: Beginning in fall 1925, current ML lists for spring or fallnof a given year were printed on ML jackets and at the end of many MLnbooks. Lists at the end of ML books were printed as part of the lastngathering containing text; lists were not included when the lastngathering did not have enough pages to accommodate them. The dating keynindicates one title added in each season and one title (preceded by ann<em>x</em>) that would not be added until the following season and thus makesnit possible to date any ML jacket and any ML book that contains a listnas having been printed by spring or fall of a given year. Importantnpoints to note in using the dating key include the following: (1) MLntitles published in January usually have lists from the previous fall;n(2) lists were not updated after spring 1967, so books with spring 1967nlists may have been printed later—and did not contain jackets withnlists; (3) although jackets can be dated conclusively on the basis ofntheir lists of ML titles, jackets were sometimes switched from one copynof a book to another, so the jacket cannot by itself conclusively datenthe book inside it, especially when the book has no list of its own. (4)nbooks printed by offset lithography were often made from photographs ofnearlier editions and cannot be conclusively dated.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>.: Editor or edited by</p>
<p><strong>edition</strong>: A slippery term with multiple meanings. In bibliographicalnterms, all printings from a given typesetting are part of the samen“edition.”</p>
<p><strong>edition costs</strong>: Cf. plant costs</p>
<p><strong>endpapers</strong>: Distinct from inserted fold. Of two types: paste-down endpapernand free endpaper.</p>
<p><strong>first edition</strong>: In popular usage, the first printing of a book. The firstnprintings of most Modern Library titles published after the Boni &amp;nLiveright period include the statement “First Modern Library Edition” orn“First Modern Library Giant Edition” on the verso of the title page;nsometimes “First Printing.” Statement usually removed from the platesnafter the first printing, sometimes not. ML books printed from offsetnlithographic plates usually retained the “first” statement on allnprintings. Apart from transcribing “first” statements on the books, thisnbibliography refers to first printing as distinct from first edition.</p>
<p><strong>fly title</strong>:  Title or short title of a book that follows the preliminaries.nThe fly title normally lacks a printed page number and is counted as thenfirst page of the text; its verso is usually blank and is counted as thensecond page of the text. When a fly title leaf is present, the firstnchapter normally begins on p. 3. In American usage, the fly title isnoften referred to as a second half title (<em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>)nwhile British usage commonly prefers “fly title” (John Carter, <em>ABC fornBook Collectors</em>). Since the half title is part of the preliminaries andnthe fly title is part of the text (or body of the text/numbered innArabic not Roman numerals), I have chosen to distinguish them by usingndifferent terms.</p>
<p><strong>folio</strong>: A sheet of paper folded to form two leaves or four pages of a book</p>
<p><strong>foot</strong>: The bottom of a page; also the bottom of the spine</p>
<p><strong>gathering</strong>: Single large piece of paper that has been folded into leavesnfor binding</p>
<p><strong>gravure</strong>:  A type of intaglio printing process, in which an image isnengraved onto a rotating copper cylinder.</p>
<p><strong>half title</strong>: Title or short title of a book that precedes the title page.nAlways on recto, usually of first leaf. The half title is part of thenpreliminaries that precede the body of the text. Cf. fly title.</p>
<p><strong>head</strong>: The top of a page; also the top of the spine</p>
<p><strong>headline</strong>: A heading consisting of a single line at the top of a page;nusually/commonly printed in capital letters. <em>See also</em> “running head.”</p>
<p><strong>GBN</strong>: Gordon B. Neavill</p>
<p><strong>IML</strong>: Illustrated Modern Library, published 1943–48.</p>
<p><strong>impression</strong>: A given printing of a book; the term “printing” is usedninstead of “impression” in this bibliography.</p>
<p><strong>imprint</strong>:  Statement at the foot of the title page indicating the name ofnthe publisher and commonly the place of publication. The year ofnpublication may also be included in the imprint, though many publishersnhave relegated the year of publication to the verso of the title page ornomitted it altogether, especially if there is a copyright date.</p>
<p><strong>in</strong>.: Inch or inches</p>
<p><strong>inserted fold</strong>: Two conjunct leaves (4 pages) added to a gathering,nusually at the en</p>
<p>d<strong>inserted leaf</strong>: A single leaf (2 pages) added to a gathering, frequentlynbut not always at the end of a gathering</p>
<p><strong>ISBN</strong>: International Standard Book Number. The ISBN, introduced in 1972,nis an international standard that uniquely identifies specific editionsnof books. The ISBN originally consisted of ten digits in four fieldsnseparated by hyphens. The first field indicates the language area orncountry of publication; the second indicates the publisher; the thirdnidentifies a specific format in which a given work is available from angiven publisher (for example, hardbound, paperback, different series,nwith different introductions, etc., or revised versions of a given work,ntranslations); the fourth is a check digit that allows a computer tonflag ISBN’s that have been entered incorrectly. Check digits range fromn0 to 10; since the fourth field is limited to a single digit, “10” isnrepresented by the Roman numeral “X”. Revised editions of a work haventheir own ISBN’s.</p>
<p>Publishers began assigning 13-digit ISBN’s in 2006–07. These have a newnprefix (978 or 979) that makes the ISBN consistent with the 13-digitnsystem of bar codes known as EAN (International Article Number) that isnused throughout the world. EAN originally stood for European ArticlenNumber, but the acronym was so well established that it remained in usenafter the 13-digit system of bar codes was adopted internationally.</p>
<p>Most ML books with ISBN’s were published in the “reissue” formatnbeginning in 1977. Some ML books with jackets designed by S. Neil Fujitanin the late 1960s and early 1970s also have ISBNs. Nearly all ML booksnwith ISBN’s printed them on the back panel of the jacket, beginning withnthe three digits (394) that indicated the publisher as Random House. Theninitial field (“0”) for the English-language area was usually omitted.nThese ISBN’s are recorded in complete form with the initial “0” added.</p>
<p>ISBN’s today are printed on the verso of the title page. The only MLnvolume included in this bibliography with an ISBN on the verso of thentitle page is a late printing of Thomas Mann’s <em>Doctor Faustus</em>n(582b). <em>See also</em> SBN.</p>
<p><strong>issue</strong>: A bibliographical term that is widely misused bynnon-bibliographers. An “issue” is created by an alteration of the textnthat affects the conditions of publication or sale of some copies of anparticular printing. The alteration usually consists of a change in thentitle page. Issues occur only within printings; there cannot be a firstnissue without a second issue. For additional information and examples,nsee “Issue” under Bibliographical Procedures. The verb “issue” isnsometimes used as a synonym for “publish.”</p>
<p><strong>kraft paper</strong>: Strong light brown paper made from pulp derived from woodnchips; used for ML jackets between 1977 and the “relaunch” of the ML inn1992.</p>
<p><strong>leaf</strong>: A leaf has two pages: the recto, which is always an odd-numberednpage, and the verso, which is always an even-numbered page. A leaf cannbe grasped between the thumb and forefinger; a page can be touched butnnot grasped. Properly speaking, the common phrase “turning the pages”nshould be “turning the leaves.”</p>
<p><strong>letterpress</strong>: A relief printing technology; the inked printing surface isnraised from the printing plate or body of the type. Printing can be donendirectly from standing metal type or from relief printing plates castnfrom individual pages of standing type; there was a letterpress platenfor each page of text. All ML books were printed from plates. Most MLnbooks were printed from letterpress plates before the mid-1960s, whennthe cost of offset lithography dropped below that of letterpressnprinting. One side of a sheet was printed at a time. Except for thenearly Boni &amp; Liveright period, each printed sheet consisted of eight ornsixteen pages of text on each side. Printers had to position the platenfor each page so that when the sheets were folded and trimmed, thenprinted pages would all be right side up and sequenced in the correctnorder. Between 1965 and 1967 the ML converted most of its titles fromnletterpress to offset.</p>
<p><strong>linen paper</strong>: Linen-finish white paper</p>
<p><strong>lithography</strong>: Printing technology based on the antipathy of oil and water.nThe printing surface of lithographic plates is neither raised, as innletterpress printing, nor recessed into the plate, as in engraving andnetching. <em>See also</em> offset.</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: (a) Modern Library series, founded by Albert Boni and HoracenLiveright in 1917 and acquired by Bennett Cerf in 1925. In partnershipnwith Donald S. Klopfer, Cerf established a new publishing house, ThenModern Library, Inc., to publish the series. The full name of the seriesnwas “The Modern Library of the World’s Best Books.” The short form isnused consistently in this bibliography. In 1936, after Cerf and Klopfernhad expanded their publishing program to include new trade books, thenfirm was reorganized under the name Random House, Inc., and the ModernnLibrary became a subsidiary of its offspring. (b) Trade books like Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> published under the RandomnHouse imprint before 1936 were copyrighted by The Modern Library, Inc.</p>
<p><em><strong>MLC</strong></em>: <em>Modern Library Collector</em>, nos. 1–55 (1981–2008). Semi-annualnnewsletter edited by Alan Oestreich; nos. 4–55 include a column,n“Bibliographical Notes and Queries,” by Gordon B. Neavill.</p>
<p><strong>ML catalogue</strong>: Published by Random House; listed new titles, titlesndropped and other information about the series. Published 1925–40?</p>
<p><strong>MLCE</strong>: Modern Library College Editions, a paperbound series intended forntextbook use in colleges and universities. The first was introduced bynRandom House in 1950. The books had introductions by noted academics.nEdited by Jess Stein, who had come to the firm to work on the AmericannCollege Dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>MLG</strong>: Modern Library Giants. A series of full sized volumes with hardncovers introduced in fall 1931. The series was used initially for worksnlike Tolstoy’s <em>War and Peace</em> (1931) that were too long to fit into thenML’s regular format and for substantial collections and anthologies suchnas <em>The Complete Novels of Jane Austen</em> (1933) and <em>The EnglishnPhilosophers from Bacon to Mill</em> (1939). Several titles were publishednin both the regular ML and MLG.</p>
<p><strong>MLP</strong>: Modern Library Paperbacks, the series of “quality” or “trade”npaperbacks published by Random House between 1955 and 1960. The seriesnwas thrown together quickly to give Random House a foothold in thenemerging quality paperback market after the collapse of extendednon-and-off negotiations with Allan Lane to acquire the American branchnof Penguin Books. When Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., inn1960, the Knopf paperback series Vintage Books became Random House’snprimary trade paperback imprint and Modern Library Paperbacks werenphased out. The best MLP titles were added to Vintage Books and the restnwere discontinued.</p>
<p><strong>mm</strong>: Millimeters</p>
<p><strong>new bibliographical edition</strong>:  <em>See</em> bibliographical edition</p>
<p><strong>NYPL</strong>: New York Public Library</p>
<p><strong>OCLC</strong>: Online Computer Library Center in Dublin, Ohio. The OCLC databasenof machine-readable bibliographic records, consisting of records creatednby the Library of Congress, other national libraries, and OCLC membernlibraries, is the largest single source of bibliographic recordsnincluded in the online catalogs of libraries in the U.S. and many otherncountries. In June 2010 the OCLC database consisted of over 193 millionnbibliographic records, each of which is identified by a unique number.nWorldCat, the public version of the OCLC database, is accessible throughnmany libraries. OCLC includes a separate database of authority recordsnwhich indicate the “authorized form” of personal, corporate, and othernnames that are used in library catalogs and identify variant forms ofnthese names that can establish “see” and “see also” references asnauthorized forms.</p>
<p><strong>offset</strong>: A lithographic printing technology where the printing area of anplate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed intonthe plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and etching).nOffset lithography is based on the antipathy of oil and water.nCommercial lithographic printing technologies are known as “offsetnlithography” or “offset” for short because the inked image on the platenis not printed directly to paper but “offset” to a third cylinderncovered with a rubber blanket before being transferred to paper carriednby a third cylinder. The ML printed occasional titles by offsetnlithography from the 1930s on, either because the original publisher’snletterpress plates were too large for the Modern Library’s compactnformat or because a work included a large number of illustrations thatnwould have been too expensive to include otherwise. Printing by offsetnlithography was more expensive than letterpress before the 1960s, andnthe quality of printing was regarded as inferior. The cost of offsetnprinting fell below that of letterpress printing in the mid-1960s.nBetween 1965 and 1967 the ML converted most of its titles fromnletterpress to offset. Many of the ML’s letterpress plates had becomenbadly worn over the years. Random House employees were encouraged tonsearch the secondhand book market for first or early printings of MLntitles to photograph for the conversion to offset lithography. In somencases where use of the original publisher’s letterpress plates resultednin uncomfortably narrow margins, the ML reduced the size of the typenpage photographically, significantly improving the appearance of thentext.</p>
<p>Malraux, <em>Man’s Fate</em> (294), published in the ML in 1936, offers annexample of a ML title that was printed initially by offset lithographynso that the type page could be reduced photographically to fit the ML’snballoon cloth format, then from the original publisher’s letterpressnplates after the introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939, andnfinally in the mid-1960s by offset lithography, with the text reducednphotographically from the original publisher’s edition to make the mostnaesthetically pleasing ML printings.</p>
<p><strong>opp</strong>.: Opposite</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: One side of a leaf. The first side of a printed leaf is the <em>recto</em>nand bears an odd page number; the second side is the <em>verso</em> and bearsnan even page number. It is possible to hide a dollar bill between thenverso of one leaf and the recto of the following leaf but not betweennrecto and verso pages.</p>
<p><strong>paratext</strong>: Introductions by the author that are unique to the ML edition,nsuch as Virginia Woolf’s introduction to <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> (1928) or F.nScott Fitzgerald’s introduction to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> (1934); can benreferred to as authorial (or author’s) paratext.</p>
<p><strong>perfect bound</strong>: Binding where separate leaves are held together with glue,nin contrast to a binding where folded gatherings are sewn with thread;nML reissues are perfect bound but earlier books are sewn</p>
<p><strong>plant costs</strong>: Cf. edition costs</p>
<p><strong>preliminaries</strong>: The leaves of a book that precede the text</p>
<p><em><strong>PTLA</strong></em>: <em>Publishers’ Trade List Annual</em>. This annual book tradenpublication consists of listings of in-print books organized bynpublisher. Modern Library listings in <em>PTLA</em> have been used to establishnthe approximate date that ML titles were discontinued in the 1970s andn1980s, after ML jackets discontinued the practice of including completenlists of ML titles that were updated each time the jacket was reprinted.</p>
<p><strong>pub. note</strong>: Publisher’s note</p>
<p><em><strong>PW</strong></em>: <em>Publishers’ Weekly</em> or <em>Publishers Weekly</em> (1872–) the tradenjournal of the U.S. book publishing industry; apostrophe dropped byn1975.</p>
<p><strong>quality paperbacks</strong>:  Paperbound books published by trade publishers and usually drawnnheavily from a given publisher’s backlist, as opposed to mass-marketnpaperbacks. Anchor Books, conceived by Jason Epstein and published bynDoubleday beginning in 1953, was the first American quality paperbacknimprint. Most of the books were priced at 65 cents or 95 cents and up.n“Quality” referred both to the physical format and the seriousness ofnthe titles. Many of the early Anchor Books had covers designed bynEdward Gorey. Quality paperbacks are also known as “trade paperbacks”nbecause they are sold in bookstores rather than mass-market outlets.nIn the 1950s they were sometimes referred to as “egghead paperbacks.”nIn contrast, mass-market paperbacks such as Pocket Books, BantamnBooks, Signet Books, and Dell then sold at retail prices of 25 or 35ncents in mass-market outlets such as drug stores and dime stores.nQuality paperbacks drew heavily on publisher’s backlist titles,nincluding many that had been long out of print. Quality paperbacksnmade many titles that had been out of print available at low prices.nThe ML lost a number of titles in the mid-1950s when publishersncanceled the ML’s reprint contracts in order to add the titles tontheir quality paperback series.</p>
<p><strong>recto</strong>: <em>See</em> “page”</p>
<p><strong>reissue</strong>: RH referred to ML titles restored to the series between 1977 andn1986 in distinctive kraft paper jackets as ML reissues. New titles addednto the series during this period were also published in the “reissue”nformat. The jackets, designed by R. D. Scudellari, the RH art director,ncame in two styles. Nonpictorial jackets with hand-lettered authors andntitles, were used beginning in 1977. The second featured woodcuts bynStephen Alcorn on the front panel of the jacket with the title innreverse against a reddish rectangular panel. I have used the phrasen“reissue format” to refer to printings in the two styles.</p>
<p>“Reissue” is an inexact and slippery term and is unrelated to thentechnical bibliographical term “issue” (q.v.), which has a precise andnclearly defined meaning but is also commonly used as a synonym forn“publish.”</p>
<p><strong>relaunch</strong>: Term used by RH to refer to the revival of the ML that began inn1992. Harry Evans, the former editor of the <em>Sunday Times</em> (London) andnthe president of Random House in the 1990s was primarily responsible fornreviving the ML. ML books published after 1991 are outside the scope ofnthis bibliography.</p>
<p><strong>RH</strong>: Random House was established in 1927 by Bennett Cerf and DonaldnKlopfer; reorganization in 1936.</p>
<p><strong>RHP</strong>: Random House Papers, Columbia University, Rare Book &amp; ManuscriptnLibrary. All citations to unpublished correspondence and othernunpublished documents are to the Random House Papers unless indicatednotherwise.</p>
<p><strong>running head</strong>: A headline, usually but not always printed in capitalnletters, that is repeated from page to page or leaf to leaf; the runningnhead can be the title of the book, a part title, or a chapter title. Thenheadline is included when referring to the number of printed lines on anpage. <em>See</em> <em>also</em> term for page numerals below the last line of text.</p>
<p><strong>SBN</strong>: Standard Book Number. Depending on the country, an 8 or 9-digit codenin three fields developed in 1966 for uniquely identifying books. Thenfirst field identifies the publisher; the second identifies a specificnedition of a book; and the third is a check digit that flags the SBN asninvalid if any of the preceding digits have been entered incorrectly.nHardbound and paperbound formats of a given book have different SBN’s.</p>
<p>The ML printed SBN’s on the back panel of many jackets in the late 1960snand 1970s—especially jackets for the “reissue” format introduced inn1976. Some ML books that continued to be sold in 1960s bindings andnjackets also had SBN’s added to the back panel of the jackets. The SBNnwas superseded by the 10-digit International Standard Book Numbern(ISBN), introduced in 1972. It was common for ML books published in then1970s and 1980s to print the 9-digit SBN on jackets; with rarenexceptions, they did not include the ISBN on the verso of the titlenpage. I have noted SBN’s printed on ML jackets between 1966 and 1972;nfor books published after 1972, I have converted the 9-digit numbers onnjackets to ISBN’s and have identified them accordingly. <em>See also</em> ISBN.</p>
<p><strong>short title</strong>: The title proper of a work, excluding other titleninformation such as a subtitle.</p>
<p><strong>shoulder note</strong>: A side-note in a printed or manuscript book, that isnpositioned in the outer margin at the top corner of the page. Also knownnas marginal note.</p>
<p><em><strong>SRL</strong></em>: <em>Saturday Review of Literature</em>, a weekly magazine devoted tonliterature and the arts that began publication in 1924; the title wasnshortened to <em>Saturday Review</em> in 1952. <em>SRL</em>’s “Trade Winds” columnnthat began in the early 1940s was written by Bennett Cerf. For the sakenof convenience, <em>SRL</em> is used to refer to both titles of the magazine.</p>
<p><strong>state</strong>: A bibliographical term that is widely misused bynnon-bibliographers. States are created by an alteration of the text inn<em>some copies</em> of a particular printing (usually by stop-press correctionnor cancellation of leaves).
