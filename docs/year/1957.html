<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1957</h1>
<h2>1957</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>As costs rose steadily in the years following the war, retail prices
inevitably had to be increased. Publishers at this period, however,
feared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off
raising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no
alternative. The $1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes
remained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954.
It increased to $1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1
January 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65.</p>
<p>As long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library
volumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the
Modern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents
per copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the
retail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers
to whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties
were going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no
general policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to
be paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only
when pressure from individual authors and publishers left no
alternative.</p>
<p>In 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in
royalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of
Little, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions.</p>
<p>Random House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause
concerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the
Modern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed
figure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s
own authors in the event of price increases.</p>
<p>Sales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing
steadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark
for the first time in 1957.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Ten titles were added and six discontinued, bringing the total number of
titles to 309.</p>
<p>Molière’s <em>Plays</em> (1924) and Ibsen’s <em>Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of
the People</em> (1917) were superseded.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with
the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.
The binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset
panels in black on the front cover and spine.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>$1.65. The new retail price went into effect on 1 January, along with
higher prices for ML Giants and other RH publications such as Landmark
Books and <em>The American College Dictionary</em>.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Caesar, <em>Gallic War</em> xLewis, <em>Cass Timberlane</em>; Giants through
G80 with G45 <em>Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers</em> and G31 Werfel, <em>Forty

Timberlane</em> xDescartes, <em>Philosophical Writings</em>; Giants through G80
with G31 <em>Famous Science–Fiction Stories</em>; jackets: 379 (=spring 1957).</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf rejected an idea for a collection of Mark Twain short stories and
sketches, stating “I don’t think it would sell well in the Modern
Library” (Cerf to Linscott, 7 December 1957).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
When Nora Helmer closed the door on her doll’s house, the modern drama
came into being. It was not so much that she asserted her emancipation
from a stifling marriage, but that Henrik Ibsen himself proclaimed the
playwright’s emancipation from the spiritless drama of his time. <em>A</em>
<em>Doll’s House</em>, <em>Hedda Gabler</em>, <em>The Master Builder, Ghosts</em>, <em>An</em>
<em>Enemy of the People</em>, and <em>Rosmersholm</em> advanced the liberation in
terms of social drama which revealed human beings confronted with
present-day problems and willing to face their consequences.</p>
<p>These completely new translations—specially prepared for this edition
by Eva Le Gallienne and benefiting from her experience as one of the
most thoughtful actresses and directors of the American stage—combine
the accuracy, the literary taste and the dramatic naturalness that
characterize all distinguished and enduring translations. (<em>Spring

<p>Front flap:<br>
Although W. Somerset Maugham has written many distinguished and widely
known novels, plays, and essays, his greatest achievement as a
literary figure is probably as a writer of short stories. It is in
this form that his craftsmanship as an unpretentious teller of good
stories is best revealed. His ability to hold the reader utterly
enchanted is well represented in the contents of this collection of
seventeen of Maugham’s best stories, including such favorite and
famous works as “Rain,” “The Letter,” and “The Colonel’s Lady.”
Devotees of Maugham will welcome this skillful selection of John
Beecroft. New readers of Maugham’s stories will find here many hours
of delightful reading and re–reading. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For more than half a century, readers who favor tales of romantic
adventure have found deep and lasting enjoyment in the novels of H.
Rider Haggard. Two of his best-known and most popular novels, <em>She</em>
and <em>King Solomon’s Mines</em>, are presented complete and unabridged in
this volume.</p>
<p><em>She</em> is the strange story of an immortal white sorceress deep inside
Africa, sought out by an Englishman intent upon avenging an ancient
crime, thrillingly told against a backdrop of a lost civilization, of
savage rites, and the mystery of an unknown land.</p>
<p><em>King Solomon’s Mines</em> is an account of the search for the fabled lost
diamond mines and treasures of King Solomon—an unforgettable story of
suspense-filled adventures. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>King Solomon’s Mines</em> originally published in London by Cassell &amp; Co.,
1885; <em>She</em> originally published in London by Longmans, Green &amp; Co.,
1887. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published April 1957. <em>WR</em> 29 April 1957. First printing: 6,000 copies.
Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p><em>King Solomon’s Mines</em> and <em>She</em> were published in the U.S. several
years before the U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 extended the possibility of
copyright protection to works by foreign authors, and both were
permanently in the U.S. public domain. Both works appeared in the U.S.
in numerous unauthorized editions.</p>
<p>Cerf had discussed including <em>She</em> or <em>King Solomon’s Mines</em> in the ML
in 1930, but no decision was reached at that time (Cerf to J. Ray Peck,
Longmans, Green, 25 September 1930; Peck to Cerf, 30 September 1930).</p>

Few figures in the history of man have had more to do with the shaping
of our present civilization than Julius Caesar. A towering political
leader, a military genius, and a skilled writer, he deserves a fate
better than that of being a subject of an unwilling schoolboy’s Latin
lesson. Those readers who have long forgotten their Latin will find in
this book new and sound perspectives on this important man, for there
are few books that provide a better, more interesting picture of
mankind at a historic crossroad.</p>
<p>This completely new translation has been specially prepared for the
Modern Library by Professor Moses Hadas of Columbia University, who
also contributes an informative and perceptive Introduction. (<em>Spring

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
As more and more we look westward across the Pacific, the writings of
James A. Michener take on increased interest and importance as
informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux.</p>
<p>The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven
through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of
Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by
Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete
without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer,
his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia
in rebirth.</p>
<p>In this volume are selections from <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>,
<em>Return to Paradise</em>, <em>The Voice of Asia</em>, and the complete text of
<em>The Bridges at Toko-Ri</em>. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection selected from <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>
(Macmillan, 1947), <em>Return to Paradise</em> (RH, 1951), and <em>The Voice of
Asia</em> (RH, 1951), with the complete text of <em>The Bridges of Toko-ri</em>
(RH, 1953). Published April 1957. <em>WR</em> 29 April 1957. First printing:
7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.</p>
<p>In the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition
of his first book, <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>, “shows how little the
publisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a
chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the
poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start
new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One important change has been made in the text here offered, and
another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about
Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long
humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word
<em>Asiatic</em> when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word
to <em>Asian</em>. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps
even greater fervor the word <em>Chinaman</em>. After my first several books
appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what
I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I
have corrected this offensive word to <em>Chinese</em>; but in certain
stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have
retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I
would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of
<em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>. He signed with Random House on 19 April
1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August
2010). His second book, <em>The Fires of Spring</em>, was published by Random
House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long
and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of
Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose
the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to
use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has
made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to
Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton
University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a
1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at
Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old
Mansion,” <em>PW</em>, 13 July 1946, p. 174).</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in the capitalization of <em>The Bridges at Toko-ri</em> are
reproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a
jacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of
Toko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”</p>

The passing of three centuries has not dimmed Molière’s genius nor
changed the perennial vices at which he hurled his shafts of comedy.
The follies and frailties of mankind still feel the impact of his
urbane wit and his meaningful laughter.</p>
<p>The eight plays in this volume, complete and unabridged, are among
Molière’s best comedies. They give full evidence of his undisputed
rank as the foremost dramatist in all French literature and concededly
one of the world’s greatest since Shakespeare.</p>
<p>These plays have all been newly translated for this edition by Morris
Bishop of Cornell University with skillful fidelity that will
establish these translations as the definitive ones of our time.

Anyone who tries to define the unique genius of James Thurber is bound

<p>Cerf had been trying to get <em>The Thurber Carnival</em> since 1946, when he
offered a $6,000 advance to include it in the Giants (Cerf to William
Rose, Jr., Harper &amp; Bros., 24 January 1946). Harper’s finally offered
the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit <em>Reading
for Pleasure</em>, an anthology published by Harper &amp; Bros. in 1957. As Cerf
told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a
long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found
irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD
and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have
been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted”
(Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10
percent of the retail price. <em>Brave New World</em> (485) was published in
the ML in fall 1956.</p>
<p>Bowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D
of the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month
Club using duplicate plates supplied by Harper &amp; Bros. In his list of
variations that distinguish state D (p. 55), however, the nose of the
dog on the fly title (p. [1]) is indicated as absent. The dog’s nose
is present in all ML printings examined.</p>
<p>Thurber’s original preface was titled “My Fifty Years with James
Thurber” and dated “December 6, 1944.” The re-titled preface in the ML
edition, “My Sixty Years with James Thurber,” is identical to the
original version except for changes in the first and next-to-last
paragraphs.</p>

<p>Stein had been considering an anthology like <em>Medieval Romances</em> for
several years. In 1952 he wrote Haskell Block of the University of
Wisconsin, “In a very tentative way I have thought of the possibility of
our doing a little collection of epic and romance in the Modern Library
some day. I don’t know whether such a thing would ever go, but I have
been asking people for suggestions as to contents . . .” (Stein to
Block, 31 October 1952).</p>
<p>Roger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis initially received
royalties of 5 cents a copy. In 1961, when ML books were selling for
$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based
on a retail price of $1.45. (<em>Medieval Romances</em> was published at $1.65,
but the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still
$1.45.) Random House usually rejected requests for higher royalties on
these grounds, but the Loomis’s royalties were increased to 10 cents a
copy.</p>

<p>When <em>Medieval Romances</em> was published both editors were affiliated with
Columbia University. After Laura Hibbard Loomis’s death in 1960 her
husband may have asked that her affiliation with Columbia University be
removed from the title page and jacket. Roger Sherman Loomis’s
affiliation with Columbia continued as professor emeritus from his
retirement in 1958 until his death in 1966.</p>

Leonardo da Vinci</em> but was turned down. The translation appears to have
been in the public domain, and Cerf wrote the following year offering
Harcourt, Brace a courtesy fee of $300 (Cerf to Jovanovich, 29 March
1956). A contract was signed, and the ML edition carries the statement,
“Published by arrangement with Harcourt, Brace and Company” (p. [iv]).</p>
<p>The translator Edward MacCurdy sometimes used the spelling McCurdy (OCLC
authority record #1622156). Linscott received a flat fee of $1,350 for
abridging the text and editing the ML edition. He told Cerf that the
project was about twice the work he anticipated because of the poor
editing of the complete edition.</p>
<p><em>The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci</em> was the first abridgment that
Linscott made for the ML after his retirement from Random House. The
others were Vasari’s <em>Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and
Architects</em> (1959: 515) and <em>The Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson</em> (1960:
520).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
An increasing opinion that <em>Cass Timberlane</em> is a novel of the stature
of <em>Arrowsmith</em>, <em>Babbitt</em>, and <em>Main Street</em> leads the editors of the
Modern Library to make it available in this permanent format.</p>
<p><em>Cass Timberlane</em> is the intense story of a marriage, written with
unsparing realism and satire, yet with compassion and maturity of
understanding. In the marriage of Judge Timberlane and his very young
wife—and indeed in the marriages of the others in the book—there is
the basis for brilliant observation and comment by one of America’s
foremost novelists. This book will be welcomed not only by those who
now read it for the first time, but by those who will enjoy re-reading
it for renewed and enlarged insights into our society. (<em>Fall 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except background in moderate green (145)
instead of vivid reddish orange. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1957\n\n## 1957\n\n### General\n\nAs costs rose steadily in the years following the war, retail prices\ninevitably had to be increased. Publishers at this period, however,\nfeared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off\nraising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no\nalternative. The $1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes\nremained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954.\nIt increased to $1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1\nJanuary 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65.\n\nAs long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library\nvolumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the\nModern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents\nper copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the\nretail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers\nto whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties\nwere going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no\ngeneral policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to\nbe paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only\nwhen pressure from individual authors and publishers left no\nalternative.\n\nIn 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in\nroyalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of\nLittle, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions.\n\nRandom House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause\nconcerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the\nModern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed\nfigure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s\nown authors in the event of price increases.\n\nSales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing\nsteadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark\nfor the first time in 1957.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nTen titles were added and six discontinued, bringing the total number of\ntitles to 309.\n\nMolière’s *Plays* (1924) and Ibsen’s *Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of\nthe People* (1917) were superseded.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine.\n\n### Price\n\n$1.65. The new retail price went into effect on 1 January, along with\nhigher prices for ML Giants and other RH publications such as Landmark\nBooks and *The American College Dictionary*.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Caesar, *Gallic War* xLewis, *Cass Timberlane*; Giants through\nG80 with G45 *Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers* and G31 Werfel, *Forty\nDays of Musa Dagh*; jackets: 379 (=fall 1957).

Michener take on increased interest and importance as\n> informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux.\n>\n> The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven\n> through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of\n> Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by\n> Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete\n> without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer,\n> his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia\n> in rebirth.\n>\n> In this volume are selections from *Tales of the South Pacific*,\n> *Return to Paradise*, *The Voice of Asia*, and the complete text of\n> *The Bridges at Toko-Ri*. (*Spring 1957*)\n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific*\n(Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of\nAsia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri*\n(RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing:\n7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.\n\nIn the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition\nof his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the\npublisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a\nchance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the\npoorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start\nnew chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:\n\n> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and\n> another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about\n> Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long\n> humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word\n> *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word\n> to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps\n> even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books\n> appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what\n> I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I\n> have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain\n> stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have\n> retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I\n> would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).\n\nMichener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of\n*Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April\n1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August\n2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random\nHouse in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long\nand highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of\nSaxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose\nthe firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to\nuse a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has\nmade from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to\nDorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton\nUniversity Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a\n1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at\nMadison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old\nMansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174).\n\nInconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are\nreproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a\njacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of\nToko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”\n\n#### 494b.

Harper’s finally offered\nthe ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading\nfor Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf\ntold it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a\nlong, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found\nirresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD\nand Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have\nbeen pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted”\n(Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10\npercent of the retail price. *Brave New World* (485) was published in\nthe ML in fall 1956.\n\nBowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D\nof the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month\nClub using duplicate plates supplied by Harper & Bros.

Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nStein had been considering an anthology like *Medieval Romances* for\nseveral years. In 1952 he wrote Haskell Block of the University of\nWisconsin, “In a very tentative way I have thought of the possibility of\nour doing a little collection of epic and romance in the Modern Library\nsome day. I don’t know whether such a thing would ever go, but I have\nbeen asking people for suggestions as to contents . . .” (Stein to\nBlock, 31 October 1952).\n\nRoger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis initially received\nroyalties of 5 cents a copy. In 1961, when ML books were selling for\n$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based\non a retail price of $1.45. (*Medieval Romances* was published at $1.65,\nbut the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still\n$1.45.) Random House usually rejected requests for higher royalties on\nthese grounds, but the Loomis’s royalties were increased to 10 cents a\ncopy.\n\n#### 497b.

Linscott approached Harcourt, Brace in the mid\n1950s for permission to publish a ML abridgement of *The Notebooks of\nLeonardo da Vinci* but was turned down. The translation appears to have\nbeen in the public domain, and Cerf wrote the following year offering\nHarcourt, Brace a courtesy fee of $300 (Cerf to Jovanovich, 29 March\n1956). A contract was signed, and the ML edition carries the statement,\n“Published by arrangement with Harcourt, Brace and Company” (p. \\[iv\\]).\n\nThe translator Edward MacCurdy sometimes used the spelling McCurdy (OCLC\nauthority record \\#1622156). Linscott received a flat fee of $1,350 for\nabridging the text and editing the ML edition. He told Cerf that the\nproject was about twice the work he anticipated because of the poor\nediting of the complete edition.\n\n*The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci* was the first abridgment that\nLinscott made for the ML after his retirement from Random House.

  "general": "As costs rose steadily in the years following the war, retail prices\ninevitably had to be increased. Publishers at this period, however,\nfeared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off\nraising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no\nalternative. The $1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes\nremained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954.\nIt increased to $1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1\nJanuary 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65.\n\nAs long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library\nvolumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the\nModern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents\nper copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the\nretail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers\nto whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties\nwere going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no\ngeneral policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to\nbe paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only\nwhen pressure from individual authors and publishers left no\nalternative.\n\nIn 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in\nroyalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of\nLittle, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions.\n\nRandom House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause\nconcerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the\nModern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed\nfigure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s\nown authors in the event of price increases.\n\nSales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing\nsteadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark\nfor the first time in 1957.",

(*Spring 1957*)\n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific*\n(Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of\nAsia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri*\n(RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing:\n7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.\n\nIn the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition\nof his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the\npublisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a\nchance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the\npoorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start\nnew chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:\n\n> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and\n> another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about\n> Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long\n> humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word\n> *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word\n> to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps\n> even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books\n> appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what\n> I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I\n> have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain\n> stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have\n> retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I\n> would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).\n\nMichener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of\n*Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April\n1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August\n2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random\nHouse in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long\nand highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of\nSaxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose\nthe firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to\nuse a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has\nmade from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to\nDorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton\nUniversity Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a\n1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at\nMadison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old\nMansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174).\n\nInconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are\nreproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a\njacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of\nToko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”\n\n#### 494b.

Harper’s finally offered\nthe ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading\nfor Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf\ntold it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a\nlong, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found\nirresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD\nand Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have\nbeen pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted”\n(Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10\npercent of the retail price. *Brave New World* (485) was published in\nthe ML in fall 1956.\n\nBowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D\nof the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month\nClub using duplicate plates supplied by Harper & Bros.

In 1961, when ML books were selling for\n$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based\non a retail price of $1.45. (*Medieval Romances* was published at $1.65,\nbut the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still\n$1.45.)

Publishers at this period, however,\nfeared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off\nraising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no\nalternative. The $1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes\nremained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954.\nIt increased to $1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1\nJanuary 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65.\n\nAs long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library\nvolumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the\nModern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents\nper copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the\nretail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers\nto whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties\nwere going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no\ngeneral policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to\nbe paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only\nwhen pressure from individual authors and publishers left no\nalternative.\n\nIn 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in\nroyalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of\nLittle, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions.\n\nRandom House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause\nconcerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the\nModern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed\nfigure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s\nown authors in the event of price increases.\n\nSales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing\nsteadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark\nfor the first time in 1957.

All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine. $1.65. The new retail price went into effect on 1 January, along with\nhigher prices for ML Giants and other RH publications such as Landmark\nBooks and *The American College Dictionary*.
