<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1933</h1>
<h2>1933</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p><em>Publishers’ Weekly</em> reported that the Modern Library’s best-selling
books for 1933 showed “a distinct change in the trend of interest of
readers. For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles,
like ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most
interesting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’
edited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is
still selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers
for the year were: Hemingway, <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>, Faulkner,
<em>Sanctuary</em>, Marx, <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other
Writings</em>, Lawrence, <em>Sons and Lovers</em>, Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em>,
Mann, <em>The Magic Mountain</em>, Merejkowski, <em>The Romance of Leonardo da
Vinci</em>, Dostoyevsky, <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, Cather, <em>Death Comes for
the Archbishop</em>, and Rostand, <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> (“Modern Library Best
Sellers,” <em>PW</em>, 13 January 1934, p. 148).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing in 1933 after the
bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The firm had been through many changes
since Albert Boni’s departure in July 1918. The name Boni &amp; Liveright
was used until fall 1928, three years after Cerf and Klopfer’s purchase
of the Modern Library deprived the firm of its most reliable source of
income. The change of name to Horace Liveright, Inc., was largely due to
confusion with the firm, Albert &amp; Charles Boni, which the Boni brothers
established in 1923.</p>
<p>Liveright borrowed money repeatedly from Arthur Pell, the firm’s
treasurer, giving him stock in the firm as collateral. By 1930 he had
lost control of the firm of which he had been co-founder. When Pell
emerged as the firm’s majority shareholder he forced Liveright to leave.
Liveright moved to Hollywood where he worked briefly at Paramount and
then Pathé Studios before returning to New York in the summer of 1931,
where he died two years later at the age of forty-nine. In December 1931
Pell changed the name of the firm to Liveright, Inc. Pell did what he
could to avert the slide into bankruptcy, but on 4 May 1933 three of its
creditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the firm
(Gilmer, pp. 232-33). Other publishers rushed in to sign up the leading
Liveright authors. Robinson Jeffers received thirteen telegrams from
publishers the day the bankruptcy was announced (Melrich V. Rosenberg to
Cerf, 17 September 1933). Even more sought after was Eugene O’Neill,
whose plays, Cerf once noted, “sold like novels” (Gelb and Gelb, p.
768). Cerf set out to get both authors, though he thought the odds
against getting O’Neill were about fifteen to one (Cerf to Crowder, 23
May 1933).</p>
<p>O’Neill relied on his friend Saxe Commins, who had recently become his
editor at Liveright, to advise him on the choice of a new publisher.
After examining the offers, Commins indicated a preference for Cerf and
Random House. As he explained later,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for the choice was that I had known Bennett professionally
during the Liveright days and recognized in him the potential of an
imaginative, resourceful, adventurous and most trustworthy publisher.
From my first meeting with his partner, Donald S. Klopfer, I was
impressed by his quiet confidence, his reliability, and his good
sense. Subsequently . . . I was to learn of his many attributes, not
the least of which is his complete selflessness (Commins, quoted in
Dorothy Commins, <em>What Is an Editor?</em>, p. 26).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerf was invited to fly down to Sea Island, Georgia, to meet with
O’Neill and Commins. O’Neill signed with Random House in June; Jeffers
signed a day or so later. One of the first acts of the reorganized
Liveright Publishing Corporation was to deliver the plates of its books
by O’Neill and Jeffers to the ML’s printers (Liveright Publishing, Inc.,
to the Modern Library, Inc., 9 August 1933; reproduced in Egleston, pp.
107–08).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer also considered trying to get Theodore Dreiser, the
most important novelist on the Liveright list. After O’Neill and Jeffers
signed with Random House Klopfer composed a letter to Dreiser making an
offer, but the letter, dated 20 June 1933, appears never to have been
sent. The original as well as the carbon copy remains in the Random
House Collection at Columbia University. One can only speculate why Cerf
and Klopfer changed their minds. Cerf did not like Dreiser personally,
and Dreiser was a notoriously difficult author to deal with. He
distrusted publishers in general and Jewish publishers in particular. In
the end, over a year after the Liveright bankruptcy, he signed with
Simon and Schuster. He completed nothing of importance during the eight
acrimonious years he remained with the firm. By 1939 he owed Simon and
Schuster over ten thousand dollars in unearned advances and other
charges (Madison, p. 108).</p>
<p>In addition to O’Neill and Jeffers, Random House acquired the editorial
services of Saxe Commins. One of O’Neill’s conditions for coming to
Random House was that his editor come with him. Random House needed a
full-time editor if it was to become seriously involved in trade
publishing, and Commins was developing into one of the best book editors
of his generation. Already the editor of Eugene O’Neill, at Random House
he was to become renowned as the editor of William Faulkner and also of
W. H. Auden, Isak Dinesen, Sinclair Lewis, James Michener, Budd
Schulberg, Irwin Shaw, Stephen Spender, and many others. Commins started
at Random House on 9 July 1933 and remained editor-in-chief until his
death in 1958, a quarter of a century later.</p>
<p>After merging two volumes by Maupassant into one and four volumes by
Wilde into two in 1932, the ML continued its efforts to make ML books a
better value by adding <em>Erewhon Revisited</em> to its edition of Samuel
Butler’s <em>Erewhon</em> (146b).</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Thirteen new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the
number of titles in the regular ML to 211. Five new titles were
published in ML Giants series; by the end of 1933 the Giants included
eleven titles in twelve volumes.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles except Lewis, <em>Arrowsmith</em> (254) were published in the
standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)
and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). <em>Arrowsmith</em> was ⅜
inch taller and wider to accommodate the Harcourt, Brace plates.</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type; <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button> was used on all but two new
titles. Ludwig, <em>Napoleon</em> (255) had <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/A7.webp'>torchbearer A7</uvalib-modal-image-button> and Louÿs,
<em>Aphrodite</em> (257) had <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/C2.webp'>torchbearer C2</uvalib-modal-image-button>. All new titles had the 3-line
imprint that began to be used in January 1931:</p>
<p>BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER</p>
<p>T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y</p>
<p>NEW YORK</p>
<p>The imprint of Louÿs, <em>Aphrodite</em> (257) differs from other 1933 titles
in the first line of the imprint, which has a colon rather than a dot
between Cerf and Klopfer’s names.</p>
<p>The imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line
format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing
firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and
Klopfer as partners.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped
in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold
above the 2-line imprint on the spine.</p>
<p>Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,
blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all
four bindings.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange
endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930
through spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were
published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles
beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was
introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s
torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books
and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>All newly published titles had individually designed pictorial jackets
except Gertrude Stein’s <em>Three Lives</em> (261) which had a distinctive
non-pictorial jacket designed by Ernst Reichl. Reichl was also
responsible for designing the Random House edition of Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>,
published in January 1934.</p>
<p>Beginning in August with Brontë, <em>Jane Eyre</em> (160), descriptive text
about the work replaced generic information about the series on the
front jacket flaps of newly published ML titles. The flap text was
written by Saxe Commins, who joined the firm as editor in July.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Lewis, <em>Arrowsmith</em> xStein, <em>Three Lives</em>; Giants through G10.
(Fall) Stein, <em>Three Lives</em> xCaldwell, <em>God’s Little Acre</em>; Giants
through G12; jackets: 225 (=spring, fall 1934).</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include George Bernard Shaw’s plays in the ML
and offered Dodd, Mead a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy for a volume consisting of <em>Man and Superman</em>, <em>St. Joan</em>, and
<em>Androcles and the Lion</em> (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 8 February 1933). Shaw
opposed inexpensive reprints of his works and kept tight control of his
copyrights, and it was only after his death in 1950 that the ML was able
to include two volumes of his plays. (Shaw temporarily relaxed his
opposition to cheap reprints in 1946, when he allowed Penguin Books to
publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of
100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.) The only
work by Shaw that appeared in the ML during his lifetime was his early
novel, <em>An Unsocial Socialist</em> (15), which was published before the U.S.
extended copyright protection to the works of foreign authors.</p>
<p>Willa Cather was another author who was ambivalent about inexpensive
reprints of her works. She allowed <em>Death Comes to the Archbishop</em> (219)
to be included in the Modern Library in 1931 but subsequently asked
Knopf not to renew the reprint contract. When Cerf tried to add Cather’s
<em>My Antonia</em> to the series in 1933 Houghton Mifflin turned him down,
probably at Cather’s request (Dale Warren to Cerf, 30 October 1933).</p>
<p>Cerf contacted Farrar and Rinehart about including Hervey Allen’s
<em>Anthony Adverse</em> in ML Giants in 1935 or 1936 (Cerf to John Farrar, 11
August 1933). The historical novel sold 300,000 copies in its first six
months and led the fiction best-seller list for two years (1933‑1934).
Farrar and Rinehart does not appear to have authorized any reprint
edition, not even by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, the leading publisher of reprint
editions for the mass market before the advent of paperbacks in 1939.
Cerf waited for five years and tried again in 1938 (see 1938 Titles
sought, suggested, declined).</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in reprinting Ogden Nash’s selection from P. G.
Wodehouse’s works, <em>Nothing but Wodehouse</em> (Doubleday, Doran, 1932),
possibly as a Giant—the volume ran to more than 1,000 pages—but
Doubleday, Doran was reprinting it in a cheap edition of their own.</p>
<p>On a different note, Klopfer asked Max Eastman, whose Marx’s <em>Capital,
The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings</em> (246) had been published in
the ML three months earlier, to translate the complete works of Lenin
for the ML, noting that it would be “a perfect follow-up book for the
Marx” and “would create a great feeling of ill-will in this country, all
of which we are very much for.” Five days later he wrote, “I am waiting
with baited breath to hear the length of the complete works of Lenin,
when you would be able to do it, and how much you would want to do a new
translation” (Klopfer to Eastman, 16 February and 21 February 1933).
Eastman replied that a volume of Lenin could be any length. He asked for
an advance of five hundred dollars and a fee of one cent per word for
the translation. He noted, “Lenin’s style is an extraordinary
phenomenon—you can feel the locomotive force of the man’s will in almost
every sentence—and it has never been reproduced in English” (Eastman to
Klopfer, 16 March 1933). Klopfer responded that the ML would like a book
of about 100,000 words (Klopfer to Eastman, 17 March 1933).</p>
<p>Eastman received the advance he asked for, but nearly a year went by
before he began working on the Lenin book. Cerf wrote in April 1934,
“These are times in which that book could sell marvelously well, and it
would be a shame to dilly-dally until somebody beats us to the gun. I
beseech you to get to work on it” (Cerf to Eastman, 4 April 1934). But
Eastman made little progress. Other work got in the way, and in August
he wrote to Cerf agreeing to an annulment of the contract. Eastman kept
the advance, which they agreed would be regarded as an advance for a
future project (Eastman to Cerf, 30 August 1934). Cerf and Klopfer gave
up the idea of including a Lenin volume in the ML. The only subsequent
book of Eastman’s to be published by Random House was <em>Love and
Revolution: My Journey through an Epoch</em> (1964)<em>.</em></p>
<p>Robert de Graff, the president of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary
Garden City Publishing Co., suggested Clemence Dane’s novel <em>Legend</em> for
the ML. Dane was the pseudonym of the English novelist, playwright, and
screenwriter Winifred Ashton. Cerf replied that he didn’t think she
would have much of a sale in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 27 January 1933;
Cerf to de Graff, 30 January 1933). Michael S. Mill, a publisher’s sales
representative, suggested a volume of Anthony Trollope; Cerf replied
that the ML would get around to it in the next couple of years (Cerf to
Mill, 28 July 1933). Trollope’s <em>The Warden &amp; Barchester Towers</em> (292)
was added to the ML in 1936.</p>
<p>Following the publication of Keats and Shelley’s <em>Complete Poetical
Works</em> (G4) in the new ML Giants series, Cerf and Klopfer considered a
Giant devoted to the complete poems of Lord Byron. Robert Linscott of
Houghton Mifflin Co. provided sales figures for the firm’s Cambridge
Edition of <em>The Complete Poetical Works</em> <em>of Lord Byron</em> (1905). Trade
sales for the three-year period 1930–32 totaled 1370 copies. Klopfer
thanked him and noted, “I think that that conclusively proves we would
not be warranted in making a Giant of a complete Byron” (Klopfer to
Linscott, 13 April 1933). The ML published Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> (420) in
1949 and <em>Selected Poetry</em> (465) in 1954.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The modern point of view, contemptuous of all the old canons of
Victorian morality, beauty and love, is nowhere more brilliantly
championed than in the novels of Aldous Huxley. Full of shrewd
commentaries and stinging humor, his books are extravaganzas that
satirize the world of today. The two novels by which he is best known,
<em>Point Counter Point</em> (No. 180) and <em>Antic Hay</em>, are in the same
temper. Both are as sophisticated as the age they reflect. <em>Antic Hay</em>
is a novel for the enlightened modern. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1923. ML edition
(252.1, pp. 7–350) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published
January 1933. <em>WR</em> 4 February 1933. First printing: 6,000 copies.</p>
<p>The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf invited
Lewis Gannett to write an introduction to a forthcoming ML title of his
choice. He selected <em>Antic Hay</em> as the most appealing but was
disappointed with the $50 fee; he had assumed the ML paid more.</p>
<p><em>Antic Hay</em> sold 3,427 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. Huxley’s <em>Point Counter Point</em> (203) sold 7,733 copies—more than
twice as many as <em>Antic Hay</em>—during the same period. <em>Antic Hay</em> was not
among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and publishing rights to Huxley’s older
books to Harper &amp; Bros. in 1939. Harper’s considered withdrawing <em>Antic
Hay</em> and <em>Point Counter Point</em> from the ML, but Klopfer was able to
negotiate new reprint contracts (see 203). New five-year contracts for
the books were sent to Harper’s on 30 March 1939. The <em>Antic Hay</em>
contract called for the ML to pay a $500 advance against royalties of 10
cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to
cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least
2,500 copies after three years.</p>

<p>New bibliographical edition (252.2, pp. 3–328) printed from plates of
the English edition published in 1923 by Chatto &amp; Windus. It is not
known whether Harper’s acquired the original Chatto &amp; Windus plates or
had duplicates made. In 1948 William H. Rose of Harper &amp; Bros. wrote
Klopfer that new plates were needed for <em>Antic Hay</em> and asked if the ML
would share the cost (Rose to Klopfer, 7 June 1948). The plates were
being used primarily by the ML, and Klopfer agreed to contribute $500
over a five-year period. During that time the ML paid an extra 2 cents a
copy above the regular 10-cent royalty rate; any balance remaining was
to be paid at the end of five years. The ML still owed $180 in 1953, so
the ML appears to have sold 16,000 copies during that period (Rose to
Klopfer, 23 July 1953).</p>
<p>Harper’s informed the ML in 1956 that they were planning to add <em>Antic
Hay</em> to Harper’s Modern Classics but did not ask that the ML edition be
withdrawn.</p>

<p>A. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,
1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. after it acquired the American
branch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made
from a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively
by the ML. Published January 1933. <em>WR</em> 4 February 1933. First printing:
6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.</p>
<p>The original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.
For its edition of France’s <em>Revolt of the Angels</em> (163), published in
1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off
the running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the
headline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was
one of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf
considered doing the same for <em>Penguin Island</em> (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4
November 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The
result was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages
shorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.</p>
<p>The ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the
translator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years
after the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of
the title page of 253c, published in 1984.</p>
<p>The ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s
(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)
but picked up in the 1940s. <em>Penguin Island</em> sold 4,876 copies during
the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The publication of <em>Penguin Island</em> brought the number of France’s works
in the ML to five. <em>The Queen</em> <em>Pédauque</em> was discontinued at the end of
1933; by the end of 1942 <em>Penguin Island</em> was the only title by France
in the series.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
First published in 1908, and widely regarded as his masterpiece,
<em>Penguin Island</em> is Anatole France’s most searching and satirical
novel. A humorous critique of customs and laws, rituals and rites, its
subject is human nature, but its characters are penguins in the
mythical land of Penguinia. The story of the strutting penguins and
their virtues and vices is not merely a burlesque allegory of French
history, it is a satire of the history of mankind. With gentle yet
biting irony, France challenges the Spencerian belief in the ultimate
perfectability [<em>sic</em>] of man, though his irony reveals his sympathy
for man’s weaknesses and his need for social institutions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
On one question, at least, critics and readers of Sinclair Lewis’s
works are likely to agree—<em>Arrowsmith</em> is his greatest novel. In it
the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature has created a
gallery of characters which, it is safe to predict, will remain
unforgettable for generations. Leora, the indomitable comrade and
wife; Gottlieb, the incorruptible scientist; Sondelius, the crusader
against plagues; and Arrowsmith, the doctor in whom a holy flame is
kindled— these are characters who give to the novel its immense power
and its blazing indignation. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1925. ML edition (254.1,
pp. [iii], 1–448) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published
February 1933. <em>WR</em> 4 March 1933. First printing: 7,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1952.</p>
<p>The ML edition (254.1a) was larger than the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format
so that it could be printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Publication of
the ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film
version starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the
appearance of Lewis’s new novel <em>Ann Vickers.</em> The ML urged booksellers
to feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement,
<em>PW</em>, 14 January 1933, p. 98).</p>
<p>The ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10
cents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset &amp; Dunlap,
which also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace
plates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the
original Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier &amp; Son.</p>
<p><em>Arrowsmith</em> sold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.
Sales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making
<em>Arrowsmith</em> the thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153
copies ahead of Hemingway, <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>.</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint
series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college
market. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s
reprint contracts for <em>Arrowsmith</em>, Lewis’s <em>Babbitt</em>, and seven other
titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton
Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML,
18 May 1948). The ML’s contract for <em>Arrowsmith</em> had four years to run.
Harcourt, Brace confirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the
firm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S. Spencer
Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to Klopfer, 28 April 1952).</p>

<p>Printed from Harcourt, Brace plates made from a new typesetting. The
plates were also used for the Harcourt, Brace “Text Edition” (1945),
edited by Barbara Grace Spayd with extensive preliminary and back matter
that not included in ML printings. Beginning in 1952, shortly after the
ML edition was discontinued, Harcourt, Brace used the plates for
printings in Harbrace Modern Classics.</p>
<p>The type page in the new edition is taller and wider than the original
Harcourt, Brace typesetting used for 254.1 and consists of two fewer
lines, resulting in a more open, less densely packed page. In ML
printings this is achieved at the cost of significantly narrower
margins. The inside margins are about 7 mm each, and the top margin is a
mere 6 mm. The lack of a headline in the new typesetting makes the
narrow top margin in ML printings particularly noticeable; the transfer
of page numerals from the headline to the foot of the page compensates
visually for the slightly narrower margin at the foot. The new plates
were better suited to the larger format of Harbrace Modern Classics.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the vast library of books devoted to the deeds and personality of
Napoleon Bonaparte, none has had such an immense popular success as
Emil Ludwig’s vibrant biography. The reason is not far to seek. Upon
the framework of historical fact, Ludwig has re-created the whole
miraculous cycle of Napoleon’s life and has imbued it with the passion
and imagination that motivated the career of the little Corsican. It
is a book of courage and violence, as vivid and as stirring as
Napoleon’s victories and ultimate humiliation. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>

The anthologist does not live who can compile a collection of short
stories and avoid loud protests for his omissions. In the field of the
German short story the choice is so wide that an inclusion of all
favorites would make a volume of encyclopedic bulk. This anthology
puts forth a comprehensive group of short novels and tales, selected
primarily because they are representative of the main currents of
German literature and those great national figures—Goethe, Schiller,
Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Zweig and others—who made it the
world’s heritage. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Published April 1933. <em>WR</em> 29 April 1933. First
printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by <em>Great German Short Novels
and Stories</em>, ed. Victor Lange (451).</p>
<p>Thomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology
of German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February
1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed
responsibility for the anthology:</p>
<p>It was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a
considerable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He
expressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract
was duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still
roaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled.
At long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German
authors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with
the job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to
gather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and
exercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to
the publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the
wastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)</p>
<p>Hitler came to power shortly before <em>Great German Short Novels and
Stories</em> was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the
volume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf,
17 April 1933).</p>
<p>When <em>Great German Short Novels and Stories</em> was being planned Cerf
contacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s <em>Death in Venice</em>,
offering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a
Thomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been
published in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf
had published Kenneth Burke’s translation of <em>Death in Venice</em> as a
separate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T.
Lowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the
out-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against
royalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.</p>
<p><em>Great German Short Novels and Stories</em> sold 4,450 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of
the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

To Pierre Louÿs, as it was to the Greeks, love is the most virtuous of
human sentiments. His famous story of the courtesan of Alexandria is
as unashamedly voluptuous as it is true to the period of antiquity in
which it transpires. When <em>Aphrodite</em> first appeared a storm of wrath
was whipped up by the guardians of morality. Today <em>Aphrodite</em> is
accepted by discriminating readers on its own merits as a novel of
sensual beauty, written in a rapturous prose, without shame and
without sin. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
As story alone <em>Vanity Fair</em> is read and cherished by each new
generation with increased absorption and admiration. One hundred years
after its first publication it still retains its original vitality and
makes the world in which Becky Sharp and its many other memorable
characters lived as meaningful as our own. Few, if any, novels in
English give so comprehensive a picture of the structure of its
society, ranging from the aristocracy, the gentry, the merchants, the
military, the colonials and the bohemians to the lowly and the
impecunious. <em>Vanity Fair</em> is a panoramic novel that makes a startling
commentary on its own times and customs with wit and audacity and
perception. It is one of the imperishable classics of English fiction.
This volume is embellished by Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches.
(<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
When it was written over one hundred years ago, Thackeray described
<em>Vanity Fair</em> as “a novel without a hero.” If it did lack a central
protagonist, his great work more than compensated for this deliberate
omission with a gallery of memorable characters now known and beloved
by readers of every shade of taste and opinion. To be able to issue
<em>Vanity Fair</em>, with Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches, in a
single volume of 784 [<em>sic</em>] pages, complete and unabridged,
fulfills the first aim of the Modern Library: to make available the
greatest book treasures of the past and present in a convenient and
inexpensive form. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.</p>
<p>Early in 1950 Stein contacted Gordon S. Ray, chairman of the English
department at the University of Illinois and the preeminent Thackeray
scholar in the United States, to see if he would be willing to write an
introduction to the MLCE edition of <em>Vanity Fair</em> instead of Thackeray’s
<em>History of Henry Esmond</em> (297) as previously arranged. Stein described
the conversation in a memo to Haas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What came back over the telephone wire was a very blistering attack
upon our edition of VANITY FAIR. He said that he uses the edition in
his classes with reluctance and that he always apologizes to them for
having to use it. His principal points of complaint are:</p>
<p>1) Our edition is not based on the final text.</p>
<p>2) Our edition does not include Thackeray’s own preface to the book.</p>
<p>3) Our edition is full of typographic errors.</p>
<p>4) We do not reproduce Thackeray’s own illustrations.</p>
<p>I am checking into the text of VANITY FAIR to find out exactly what is
involved in producing a completely satisfactory book and will let you
know within a few days what I turn up. Next Friday Ray will be in town
and I have an appointment with him. Naturally I hope that I can at
that time assure him that we will put out a completely satisfactory
edition. At the moment the principal inexpensive editions of VANITY
FAIR that are available are Modern Library, Everyman’s Library, and
Great Illustrated Classics (Dodd, Mead, $2.50). Neither Harper nor
Rinehart has an edition of VANITY FAIR available right now, but
Rinehart does have one in preparation. It seems imperative therefore
that we have our edition of VANITY FAIR in improved form available
this fall (Stein memo to Haas, 10 February 1950).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ray indicated that the 1864 edition with revisions by Thackeray should
be followed. Stein believed that the text of the 1933 ML edition
followed Thackeray’s original text as published in parts, 1847–48. At
first he hoped that the existing plates could be used for the new ML
edition. He told Ray, “Naturally I don’t want our text to be one which
does not have scholarly approval. I don’t know yet whether a collation
or a resetting is our solution but we will do one or the other to bring
the text completely in line with the 1864 version. Because of production
costs I am not sure yet that the illustrations, vignettes and initial
letters can be included in as moderately priced a book as we plan to
have” (Stein to Ray, 28 March 1950).</p>
<p>In the end the ML reset the text (Stein to Ray, 20 June 1950) and
included eight of Thackeray’s illustrations along with facsimiles of the
title page of the first edition and the wrapper of one of the original
monthly parts. Earlier ML printings (258.1) included the two facsimiles
and three of Thackeray’s illustrations.</p>
<p>Ray appears to have declined Stein’s suggestion that he write an
introduction to <em>Vanity Fair</em> instead of <em>History of Henry Esmond</em>, and
Stein offered Joseph Warren Beach $200 to write the introduction. Beach
replied that he would take on the assignment for $500 but later agreed
to accept the amount offered (Stein to Beach, 25 January 1950; Beach to
Stein, 27 January 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 27 February 1950).</p>
<p>The ML’s goal, Stein told Beach, was to produce “an inviting edition
that can be enjoyed by the American student as a novel as readable today
as it was a century ago” (Stein to Beach, 23 May 1950). The Note on the
Text stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The present Modern Library edition of <em>Vanity Fair</em> is based on the
1864 edition, which represents the final revisions made by Thackeray,
and is preferable to earlier editions as representing what Thackeray
considered improvements. Certain obvious misprints in the earlier and
later editions have been corrected. In the case of certain doubtful
readings we have followed the Oxford edition of <em>Vanity Fair</em> edited
by Saintsbury in 1908, but we have not always accepted Saintsbury’s
emendations. A few of Thackeray’s own full-page illustrations, of
which there were some forty in all, have been included—enough to give
a notion of the quaint visual aids offered the reader of what
Thackeray called “these histories in their gaudy yellow covers”; but
considerations of expense make it impossible to include the still more
numerous sketches at the head of each chapter or set into the text.

<p>The ML’s announcement of its 1933 list stated: “The publication of this

deliberate move to emphasize the scope and range of the Modern Library

<p>James Crowder, the ML’s senior sales representative, told Cerf and
Klopfer that he didn’t expect <em>Vile Bodies</em> would sell well—and didn’t
expect they did, either. <em>Vile Bodies</em> limped along in the series until
1940, when the decision to drop it could be put off no longer. Over
thirty-five years later Klopfer still recalled how they hated to let it
go (Klopfer, interview with GBN, 1 June 1977).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In her introduction to her sister’s novel, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>,
Charlotte Brontë wrote: “The writer who possesses the creative gift
owns something that strangely wills and works for itself.” This
observation has an especial application to her own <em>Jane Eyre</em>, for it
emphasizes the reasons for the vitality and individuality of one of
the most highly cherished treasures in our literature. Since it is
partially autobiographical, the poignancy of <em>Jane Eyre</em> is linked to
the deathless interest and the heart rending pathos of the lives of
the Brontës. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
August 1933. <em>WR</em> 2 September 1933. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Jane Eyre</em> was the first ML book to include descriptive text about the
work on the jacket flap. Descriptive text about each ML title appeared
on the front panel of the jacket from May 1917 through spring 1928. For
the next five years (fall 1928–July 1933) ML jackets included
information about the series as a whole on the front flap but nothing
specifically about individual works. Saxe Commins, who joined Random
House as editor in July 1933, wrote the flap text for <em>Jane Eyre</em> and
subsequently published ML titles. As jackets of older ML titles were
reprinted, he provided flap text about those works as well.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Jane Eyre</em> increased substantially during the Second World
War. There were nineteen printings between 1933 and early 1944 for a
total of 37,000 copies. Of these, 10,453 copies were sold during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing <em>Jane Eyre</em> in the
first quarter of ML and Giant titles, just above Thackeray’s <em>Vanity
Fair</em>. It sold 3,502 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML
and Giant titles. <em>Vanity Fair</em>, with sales of 5,390 copies, retained a
solid position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

<p>The ML reset the text for the Illustrated ML (IML 8) and subsequently
used the plates for regular ML printings. The full page illustrations in
Illustrated Modern Library printings are omitted, but two of Edward A.
Wilson’s drawings are retained—the decorative vignette of two birds at
the beginning of the Preface (p. v) and the illustration of a barren
tree at the head of Chapter One (p. 3).</p>
<p>The first word or two of each chapter is set in Lilith, a decorated
typeface designed by Lucian Bernhard in 1930. Hutchings describes it as
a “twentieth century parody of Victorian decorated typefaces” and “a
pastiche of some or the more notable design features of the 1840–50
decade. The collared main-strokes to the capitals, bifurcated terminals,
horizontal hatching, and formalized shadow effect are characteristic of
the period, although the swash forms of the capitals and the inclusion
of lower-case were then exceptional” (<em>Manual of Decorated Typefaces</em>,
p. 54).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“<em>Three Lives</em>,” says the Saturday Review, “stands as a massive
doorpost in the entrance to the latest and best in American
literature.” The book has had a curious history. Readers who were
baffled by Gertrude Stein’s later work were afraid to tackle it. Twice
it was allowed to go out of print altogether. Each time, however,
enthusiastic admirers created sufficient demand to warrant new
printings. The emphatic success of Miss Stein’s autobiography must
finally win for this splendid book the wide audience that is its due.
(<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Grafton Press, 1909. Reprinted by Albert &amp;
Charles Boni, 1927. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–279) printed from
Grafton/Boni plates. Published September 1933. <em>WR</em> 7 October 1933.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941.</p>
<p>After Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. published Stein’s <em>Autobiography of Alice B.
Toklas</em> in 1933, Carl Van Vechten suggested that the ML bring out some
of Stein’s earlier work. Cerf cabled Stein in Paris about a ML edition
of <em>Three</em> <em>Lives</em> (Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, p. 101). RH subsequently became
Stein’s regular publisher, and a warm friendship developed between Cerf
and Stein.</p>
<p>The ML acquired the plates and full publishing rights to <em>Three Lives</em>,
and Van Vechten wrote a new introduction for the ML edition. Cerf
informed Stein a month after publication that “the book is proving to be
a tremendous success for us. It is causing more comment than any new
Modern Library title in the past two years. The firm of R. H. Macy &amp;
Co., which has probably the largest book department in the world today,
has bought the astonishing number of 1300 copies of this little book
since publication day less than a month ago. The total sale to date is
over 4500 copies” (Cerf to Stein, 23 October 1933).</p>
<p>Sales appear to have dropped off in the later 1930s, and <em>Three Lives</em>
was discontinued at the end of 1940. Cerf persuaded James Laughlin of
New Directions to add <em>Three Lives</em> to their New Classics series in
1941. New Directions used the ML’s plates, including Van Vechten’s
introduction, and paid the ML a $250 advance against royalties of 10
cents a copy. Cerf told Stein that she would receive $125 (her half of
the advance) from the New Directions edition in the next year alone
(Cerf to Stein, 17 September 1941).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Of all the historical romances ever written, none has had such wide
popularity as <em>Ben Hur</em>. The avidity with which it was read when it
was first issued in 1880 has never abated, and new generations of
readers, surfeited with less glamorous fare, feast on this chronicle
of the first days of Christianity with increasing delight. To them, as
to their elders, <em>Ben Hur</em> is a fast-moving and absorbing tale, full
of the color and pageantry of Rome at the height of its glory, and
packed with action and excitement. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1880. New bibliographical
edition (“Player’s Edition”) published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1901. ML
edition (pp. [iii], v–[552]) printed from “Player’s Edition” plates
with illustrations, running heads, and single-rule borders enclosing
each page omitted. Published October 1933. <em>WR</em> 4 November 1933. First
(and probably only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1941.</p>
<p>Cerf initially offered Harper &amp; Bros. a $2,000 advance against royalties
of 10 cents a copy. He indicated that he wanted to publish <em>Ben-Hur</em> in
October 1933 so the ML could have as much time as possible to sell its
edition before the work entered the public domain in 1936 (Cerf to Henry
Hoyns, Harper’s, 12 May 1933). The advance was reduced to $1,000 in the
contract dated 17 May 1933. The small type and dated nineteenth-century
typography of the “Player’s Edition” plates made <em>Ben-Hur</em> one of the
least attractive volumes in the series. The ML edition was not a
success; copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder
marking of a star stamped on the endpaper.</p>
<p>The ML omitted the hyphen from the title on the jacket, half title,
title page, biographical and bibliographical note, and lists of titles
in the series. Ben-Hur is hyphenated throughout the text.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
With the publication of <em>Eminent Victorians</em> in 1918, the art of
biography was given a new impetus. The astonishing brilliance of
Lytton Strachey’s portraits illuminated the hidden facets of his
subjects as well as the motives and tendencies of the era in which
they lived. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s
graphic and vivacious methods, and the present-day enthusiasm for
biographical literature is directly traceable to his innovating
technique. Strachey himself considered <em>Eminent Victorians</em> his finest
work. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Harcourt, Brace acquired the rights to <em>Eminent Victorians</em> after
publishing Strachey’s <em>Queen Victoria</em> (1921) and <em>Elizabeth and Essex</em>
(1928). When Cerf expressed interest in a Strachey title for the ML,
Alfred Harcourt replied that neither <em>Queen Victoria</em> nor <em>Elizabeth and
Essex</em> would be available since the firm wanted to promote them as
textbooks after a reprint contracts held by Blue Ribbon Books expired.
He indicated that the ML could have <em>Eminent Victorians</em> in June 1933
when the Star Dollar Books edition published by Garden City Publishing
Co. would be exhausted (Harcourt to Cerf, 27 September 1932). The
following April he reported that the Star edition was out of print and
that <em>Eminent Victorians</em> was available whenever the ML wanted it
(Harcourt to Cerf, 21 April 1933). The original plates were too large
for the ML’s format and Harcourt, Brace made new plates for the ML
edition, for which the ML was billed $500. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace
royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Eminent Victorians</em> sold 2,967 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Before the publication of <em>Eminent Victorians</em> the art of biography
had fallen into a decline that made of most lives a journeyman’s
compilation of volumes commemorating the dead. To the task of putting
an end to this kind of literary abomination, Lytton Strachey brought
many special qualifications. Of these, the most notable were his acute
sense of the past, a scholarship both accurate and spirited, and a
vivid style. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s
graphic and vitalizing methods, and the current enthusiasm for works
of biography is directly traceable to his innovations. By unanimous
consent <em>Eminent Victorians</em> is his most noteworthy book. In it he
evaluates the lives and times of Cardinal Manning, Florence
Nightingale, Dr. Thomas Arnold of Rugby and General Charles George
(Chinese) Gordon. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>

<em>Remembrance of Things Past</em> is the general title for the seven

are being made available for Modern Library readers, all in the
masterful translations of C. K. Scott Moncrieff. . . . <em>The Guermantes
Way</em> is the third of the series. These novels should be read in their
proper order, that their subtlety and depth may be savored to the

</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Thomas Seltzer, 1925;
reprinted 1928 by Albert &amp; Charles Boni. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>–<em>9</em>],
1–428; 1–395) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates in one volume with part
titles added and headings “Part I” and “Part II” added to the table of
contents. Published December 1933. <em>WR</em> 23 December 1933. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Fifteen months after the ML edition of <em>Within a Budding Grove</em> (194)
was published Cerf wrote to Albert Boni about adding <em>The Guermantes
Way</em> to the series in fall 1931 or spring 1932 (Cerf to Boni, 17 April
1931). Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set of
<em>Remembrance of Things Past</em> would be undermined if individual volumes
appeared in the ML too rapidly. Cerf approached him again a few months
later with an offer that he hoped would entice Boni to release the work
for publication in spring 1932. He offered an advance of $1,500 payable
immediately, or $2,000 with half paid on signing and the balance on
publication, against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Boni, 3 July
1931). The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year
and specified that the ML edition could not be published before October
1933. The ML paid Boni a $1,500 advance with $750 payable on signing
(Cerf to Boni, 23 November 1932).</p>
<p><em>Swann’s Way</em> (166) was the only Proust title to achieve consistently
good sales in the ML. <em>The Guermantes Way</em> sold 1,997 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth
worst-selling title. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1933\n\n## 1933\n\n### General\n\n*Publishers’ Weekly* reported that the Modern Library’s best-selling\nbooks for 1933 showed “a distinct change in the trend of interest of\nreaders. For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles,\nlike ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most\ninteresting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’\nedited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is\nstill selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers\nfor the year were: Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*, Faulkner,\n*Sanctuary*, Marx, *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other\nWritings*, Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*, Maugham, *Of Human Bondage*,\nMann, *The Magic Mountain*, Merejkowski, *The Romance of Leonardo da\nVinci*, Dostoyevsky, *The Brothers Karamazov*, Cather, *Death Comes for\nthe Archbishop*, and Rostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (“Modern Library Best\nSellers,” *PW*, 13 January 1934, p. 148).\n\nCerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing in 1933 after the\nbankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The firm had been through many changes\nsince Albert Boni’s departure in July 1918. The name Boni & Liveright\nwas used until fall 1928, three years after Cerf and Klopfer’s purchase\nof the Modern Library deprived the firm of its most reliable source of\nincome. The change of name to Horace Liveright, Inc., was largely due to\nconfusion with the firm, Albert & Charles Boni, which the Boni brothers\nestablished in 1923.\n\nLiveright borrowed money repeatedly from Arthur Pell, the firm’s\ntreasurer, giving him stock in the firm as collateral. By 1930 he had\nlost control of the firm of which he had been co-founder. When Pell\nemerged as the firm’s majority shareholder he forced Liveright to leave.\nLiveright moved to Hollywood where he worked briefly at Paramount and\nthen Pathé Studios before returning to New York in the summer of 1931,\nwhere he died two years later at the age of forty-nine. In December 1931\nPell changed the name of the firm to Liveright, Inc. Pell did what he\ncould to avert the slide into bankruptcy, but on 4 May 1933 three of its\ncreditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the firm\n(Gilmer, pp. 232-33). Other publishers rushed in to sign up the leading\nLiveright authors. Robinson Jeffers received thirteen telegrams from\npublishers the day the bankruptcy was announced (Melrich V. Rosenberg to\nCerf, 17 September 1933). Even more sought after was Eugene O’Neill,\nwhose plays, Cerf once noted, “sold like novels” (Gelb and Gelb, p.\n768). Cerf set out to get both authors, though he thought the odds\nagainst getting O’Neill were about fifteen to one (Cerf to Crowder, 23\nMay 1933).\n\nO’Neill relied on his friend Saxe Commins, who had recently become his\neditor at Liveright, to advise him on the choice of a new publisher.\nAfter examining the offers, Commins indicated a preference for Cerf and\nRandom House. As he explained later,\n\n> The reason for the choice was that I had known Bennett professionally\n> during the Liveright days and recognized in him the potential of an\n> imaginative, resourceful, adventurous and most trustworthy publisher.\n> From my first meeting with his partner, Donald S. Klopfer, I was\n> impressed by his quiet confidence, his reliability, and his good\n> sense. Subsequently . . . I was to learn of his many attributes, not\n> the least of which is his complete selflessness (Commins, quoted in\n> Dorothy Commins, *What Is an Editor?*, p. 26).\n\nCerf was invited to fly down to Sea Island, Georgia, to meet with\nO’Neill and Commins. O’Neill signed with Random House in June; Jeffers\nsigned a day or so later. One of the first acts of the reorganized\nLiveright Publishing Corporation was to deliver the plates of its books\nby O’Neill and Jeffers to the ML’s printers (Liveright Publishing, Inc.,\nto the Modern Library, Inc., 9 August 1933; reproduced in Egleston, pp.\n107–08).\n\nCerf and Klopfer also considered trying to get Theodore Dreiser, the\nmost important novelist on the Liveright list. After O’Neill and Jeffers\nsigned with Random House Klopfer composed a letter to Dreiser making an\noffer, but the letter, dated 20 June 1933, appears never to have been\nsent. The original as well as the carbon copy remains in the Random\nHouse Collection at Columbia University. One can only speculate why Cerf\nand Klopfer changed their minds. Cerf did not like Dreiser personally,\nand Dreiser was a notoriously difficult author to deal with. He\ndistrusted publishers in general and Jewish publishers in particular. In\nthe end, over a year after the Liveright bankruptcy, he signed with\nSimon and Schuster. He completed nothing of importance during the eight\nacrimonious years he remained with the firm. By 1939 he owed Simon and\nSchuster over ten thousand dollars in unearned advances and other\ncharges (Madison, p. 108).\n\nIn addition to O’Neill and Jeffers, Random House acquired the editorial\nservices of Saxe Commins. One of O’Neill’s conditions for coming to\nRandom House was that his editor come with him. Random House needed a\nfull-time editor if it was to become seriously involved in trade\npublishing, and Commins was developing into one of the best book editors\nof his generation. Already the editor of Eugene O’Neill, at Random House\nhe was to become renowned as the editor of William Faulkner and also of\nW. H. Auden, Isak Dinesen, Sinclair Lewis, James Michener, Budd\nSchulberg, Irwin Shaw, Stephen Spender, and many others. Commins started\nat Random House on 9 July 1933 and remained editor-in-chief until his\ndeath in 1958, a quarter of a century later.\n\nAfter merging two volumes by Maupassant into one and four volumes by\nWilde into two in 1932, the ML continued its efforts to make ML books a\nbetter value by adding *Erewhon Revisited* to its edition of Samuel\nButler’s *Erewhon* (146b).\n\n### Number of titles\n\nThirteen new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of titles in the regular ML to 211. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants series; by the end of 1933 the Giants included\neleven titles in twelve volumes.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles except Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Arrowsmith* was ⅜\ninch taller and wider to accommodate the Harcourt, Brace plates.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type; torchbearer A2 was used on all but two new\ntitles. Ludwig, *Napoleon* (255) had torchbearer A7 and Louÿs,\n*Aphrodite* (257) had torchbearer C2. All new titles had the 3-line\nimprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprint of Louÿs, *Aphrodite* (257) differs from other 1933 titles\nin the first line of the imprint, which has a colon rather than a dot\nbetween Cerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners.\n\n### Binding\n\nBalloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nRockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll newly published titles had individually designed pictorial jackets\nexcept Gertrude Stein’s *Three Lives* (261) which had a distinctive\nnon-pictorial jacket designed by Ernst Reichl. Reichl was also\nresponsible for designing the Random House edition of Joyce’s *Ulysses*,\npublished in January 1934.\n\nBeginning in August with Brontë, *Jane Eyre* (160), descriptive text\nabout the work replaced generic information about the series on the\nfront jacket flaps of newly published ML titles. The flap text was\nwritten by Saxe Commins, who joined the firm as editor in July.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Lewis, *Arrowsmith* xStein, *Three Lives*; Giants through G10.\n(Fall) Stein, *Three Lives* xCaldwell, *God’s Little Acre*; Giants\nthrough G12; jackets: 225 (=spring, fall 1934).\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to include George Bernard Shaw’s plays in the ML\nand offered Dodd, Mead a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy for a volume consisting of *Man and Superman*, *St. Joan*, and\n*Androcles and the Lion* (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 8 February 1933). Shaw\nopposed inexpensive reprints of his works and kept tight control of his\ncopyrights, and it was only after his death in 1950 that the ML was able\nto include two volumes of his plays. (Shaw temporarily relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints in 1946, when he allowed Penguin Books to\npublish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of\n100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.) The only\nwork by Shaw that appeared in the ML during his lifetime was his early\nnovel, *An Unsocial Socialist* (15), which was published before the U.S.\nextended copyright protection to the works of foreign authors.\n\nWilla Cather was another author who was ambivalent about inexpensive\nreprints of her works. She allowed *Death Comes to the Archbishop* (219)\nto be included in the Modern Library in 1931 but subsequently asked\nKnopf not to renew the reprint contract. When Cerf tried to add Cather’s\n*My Antonia* to the series in 1933 Houghton Mifflin turned him down,\nprobably at Cather’s request (Dale Warren to Cerf, 30 October 1933).\n\nCerf contacted Farrar and Rinehart about including Hervey Allen’s\n*Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants in 1935 or 1936 (Cerf to John Farrar, 11\nAugust 1933). The historical novel sold 300,000 copies in its first six\nmonths and led the fiction best-seller list for two years (1933‑1934).\nFarrar and Rinehart does not appear to have authorized any reprint\nedition, not even by Grosset & Dunlap, the leading publisher of reprint\neditions for the mass market before the advent of paperbacks in 1939.\nCerf waited for five years and tried again in 1938 (see 1938 Titles\nsought, suggested, declined).\n\nCerf expressed interest in reprinting Ogden Nash’s selection from P. G.\nWodehouse’s works, *Nothing but Wodehouse* (Doubleday, Doran, 1932),\npossibly as a Giant—the volume ran to more than 1,000 pages—but\nDoubleday, Doran was reprinting it in a cheap edition of their own.\n\nOn a different note, Klopfer asked Max Eastman, whose Marx’s *Capital,\nThe Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings* (246) had been published in\nthe ML three months earlier, to translate the complete works of Lenin\nfor the ML, noting that it would be “a perfect follow-up book for the\nMarx” and “would create a great feeling of ill-will in this country, all\nof which we are very much for.” Five days later he wrote, “I am waiting\nwith baited breath to hear the length of the complete works of Lenin,\nwhen you would be able to do it, and how much you would want to do a new\ntranslation” (Klopfer to Eastman, 16 February and 21 February 1933).\nEastman replied that a volume of Lenin could be any length. He asked for\nan advance of five hundred dollars and a fee of one cent per word for\nthe translation. He noted, “Lenin’s style is an extraordinary\nphenomenon—you can feel the locomotive force of the man’s will in almost\nevery sentence—and it has never been reproduced in English” (Eastman to\nKlopfer, 16 March 1933). Klopfer responded that the ML would like a book\nof about 100,000 words (Klopfer to Eastman, 17 March 1933).\n\nEastman received the advance he asked for, but nearly a year went by\nbefore he began working on the Lenin book. Cerf wrote in April 1934,\n“These are times in which that book could sell marvelously well, and it\nwould be a shame to dilly-dally until somebody beats us to the gun. I\nbeseech you to get to work on it” (Cerf to Eastman, 4 April 1934). But\nEastman made little progress. Other work got in the way, and in August\nhe wrote to Cerf agreeing to an annulment of the contract. Eastman kept\nthe advance, which they agreed would be regarded as an advance for a\nfuture project (Eastman to Cerf, 30 August 1934). Cerf and Klopfer gave\nup the idea of including a Lenin volume in the ML. The only subsequent\nbook of Eastman’s to be published by Random House was *Love and\nRevolution: My Journey through an Epoch* (1964)*.*\n\nRobert de Graff, the president of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary\nGarden City Publishing Co., suggested Clemence Dane’s novel *Legend* for\nthe ML. Dane was the pseudonym of the English novelist, playwright, and\nscreenwriter Winifred Ashton. Cerf replied that he didn’t think she\nwould have much of a sale in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 27 January 1933;\nCerf to de Graff, 30 January 1933). Michael S. Mill, a publisher’s sales\nrepresentative, suggested a volume of Anthony Trollope; Cerf replied\nthat the ML would get around to it in the next couple of years (Cerf to\nMill, 28 July 1933). Trollope’s *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (292)\nwas added to the ML in 1936.\n\nFollowing the publication of Keats and Shelley’s *Complete Poetical\nWorks* (G4) in the new ML Giants series, Cerf and Klopfer considered a\nGiant devoted to the complete poems of Lord Byron. Robert Linscott of\nHoughton Mifflin Co. provided sales figures for the firm’s Cambridge\nEdition of *The Complete Poetical Works* *of Lord Byron* (1905). Trade\nsales for the three-year period 1930–32 totaled 1370 copies. Klopfer\nthanked him and noted, “I think that that conclusively proves we would\nnot be warranted in making a Giant of a complete Byron” (Klopfer to\nLinscott, 13 April 1933). The ML published Byron’s *Don Juan* (420) in\n1949 and *Selected Poetry* (465) in 1954.\n\n### New titles\n\nHuxley, *Antic Hay* (1933) 252\n\nFrance, *Penguin Island* (1933) 253\n\nLewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933) 254\n\nLudwig, *Napoleon* (1933) 255\n\nCerf, ed., *Great German Short Novels and Stories* (1933) 256\n\nLouÿs, *Aphrodite* (1933) 257\n\nThackeray, *Vanity Fair* (1933) 258\n\nWaugh, *Vile Bodies* (1933) 259\n\nBrontë, *Jane Eyre* (1933) 260\n\nStein, *Three Lives* (1933) 261\n\nWallace, *Ben-Hur* (1933) 262\n\nStrachey, *Eminent Victorians* (1933) 263\n\nProust*, Guermantes Way* (1933) 264### Discontinued\n\nBeardsley, *Art of Aubrey Beardsley* (1918)\n\nEllis, *New Spirit* (1921)\n\nGourmont, *Virgin Heart* (1927)\n\nGourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926)\n\nPaine, *Selected Writings* (1922)\n\nSaltus, *Imperial Orgy* (1927)\n\nSchnitzler, *Anatol, Living Hours, The Green Cockatoo* (1918)\n\nTolstoy, *Death of Ivan Ilyitch* (1918)\n\nTolstoy, *Redemption and Two Other Plays* (1919)\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 252\n\n**ALDOUS HUXLEY.

He selected *Antic Hay* as the most appealing but was\ndisappointed with the $50 fee; he had assumed the ML paid more.\n\n*Antic Hay* sold 3,427 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203) sold 7,733 copies—more than\ntwice as many as *Antic Hay*—during the same period. *Antic Hay* was not\namong the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\nDoubleday, Doran sold its plates and publishing rights to Huxley’s older\nbooks to Harper & Bros. in 1939. Harper’s considered withdrawing *Antic\nHay* and *Point Counter Point* from the ML, but Klopfer was able to\nnegotiate new reprint contracts (see 203). New five-year contracts for\nthe books were sent to Harper’s on 30 March 1939. The *Antic Hay*\ncontract called for the ML to pay a $500 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to\ncancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least\n2,500 copies after three years.\n\n#### 252.1b.

Rose of Harper & Bros. wrote\nKlopfer that new plates were needed for *Antic Hay* and asked if the ML\nwould share the cost (Rose to Klopfer, 7 June 1948). The plates were\nbeing used primarily by the ML, and Klopfer agreed to contribute $500\nover a five-year period. During that time the ML paid an extra 2 cents a\ncopy above the regular 10-cent royalty rate; any balance remaining was\nto be paid at the end of five years. The ML still owed $180 in 1953, so\nthe ML appears to have sold 16,000 copies during that period (Rose to\nKlopfer, 23 July 1953).\n\nHarper’s informed the ML in 1956 that they were planning to add *Antic\nHay* to Harper’s Modern Classics but did not ask that the ML edition be\nwithdrawn.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library:</span>\n\nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (1930–1967) 203\n\nHuxley, *Brave New World* (1956–1967) 485\n\n### 253\n\n**ANATOLE FRANCE.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\nA. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,\n1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American\nbranch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made\nfrom a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively\nby the ML. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing:\n6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.\n\nThe original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.\nFor its edition of France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163), published in\n1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off\nthe running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the\nheadline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was\none of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf\nconsidered doing the same for *Penguin Island* (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4\nNovember 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The\nresult was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages\nshorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.\n\nThe ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the\ntranslator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years\nafter the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of\nthe title page of 253c, published in 1984.\n\nThe ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s\n(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)\nbut picked up in the 1940s. *Penguin Island* sold 4,876 copies during\nthe eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\nThe publication of *Penguin Island* brought the number of France’s works\nin the ML to five. *The Queen* *Pédauque* was discontinued at the end of\n1933; by the end of 1942 *Penguin Island* was the only title by France\nin the series.\n\n#### 253b.

First printing: 7,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1952.\n\nThe ML edition (254.1a) was larger than the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format\nso that it could be printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Publication of\nthe ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film\nversion starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the\nappearance of Lewis’s new novel *Ann Vickers.* The ML urged booksellers\nto feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement,\n*PW*, 14 January 1933, p. 98).\n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset & Dunlap,\nwhich also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace\nplates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the\noriginal Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier & Son.\n\n*Arrowsmith* sold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nSales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making\n*Arrowsmith* the thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153\ncopies ahead of Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*.\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college\nmarket. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s\nreprint contracts for *Arrowsmith*, Lewis’s *Babbitt*, and seven other\ntitles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton\nStrachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML,\n18 May 1948). The ML’s contract for *Arrowsmith* had four years to run.\nHarcourt, Brace confirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the\nfirm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1933. *WR* 29 April 1933. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by *Great German Short Novels\nand Stories*, ed. Victor Lange (451).\n\nThomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology\nof German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February\n1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed\nresponsibility for the anthology:\n\nIt was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a\nconsiderable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He\nexpressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract\nwas duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still\nroaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled.\nAt long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German\nauthors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with\nthe job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to\ngather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and\nexercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to\nthe publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the\nwastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)\n\nHitler came to power shortly before *Great German Short Novels and\nStories* was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the\nvolume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf,\n17 April 1933).\n\nWhen *Great German Short Novels and Stories* was being planned Cerf\ncontacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s *Death in Venice*,\noffering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a\nThomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been\npublished in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf\nhad published Kenneth Burke’s translation of *Death in Venice* as a\nseparate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T.\nLowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the\nout-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against\nroyalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.\n\n*Great German Short Novels and Stories* sold 4,450 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of\nthe second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n#### 256b.

Few, if any, novels in\n> English give so comprehensive a picture of the structure of its\n> society, ranging from the aristocracy, the gentry, the merchants, the\n> military, the colonials and the bohemians to the lowly and the\n> impecunious. *Vanity Fair* is a panoramic novel that makes a startling\n> commentary on its own times and customs with wit and audacity and\n> perception. It is one of the imperishable classics of English fiction.\n> This volume is embellished by Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches.\n> (*Spring 1951*)\n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br>\n> When it was written over one hundred years ago, Thackeray described\n> *Vanity Fair* as “a novel without a hero.” If it did lack a central\n> protagonist, his great work more than compensated for this deliberate\n> omission with a gallery of memorable characters now known and beloved\n> by readers of every shade of taste and opinion. To be able to issue\n> *Vanity Fair*, with Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches, in a\n> single volume of 784 \\[*sic*\\] pages, complete and unabridged,\n> fulfills the first aim of the Modern Library: to make available the\n> greatest book treasures of the past and present in a convenient and\n> inexpensive form. (*Fall 1954*)\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.\n\nEarly in 1950 Stein contacted Gordon S. Ray, chairman of the English\ndepartment at the University of Illinois and the preeminent Thackeray\nscholar in the United States, to see if he would be willing to write an\nintroduction to the MLCE edition of *Vanity Fair* instead of Thackeray’s\n*History of Henry Esmond* (297) as previously arranged. Stein described\nthe conversation in a memo to Haas:\n\n> What came back over the telephone wire was a very blistering attack\n> upon our edition of VANITY FAIR. He said that he uses the edition in\n> his classes with reluctance and that he always apologizes to them for\n> having to use it. His principal points of complaint are:\n>\n> 1\\) Our edition is not based on the final text.\n>\n> 2\\) Our edition does not include Thackeray’s own preface to the book.\n>\n> 3\\) Our edition is full of typographic errors.\n>\n> 4\\) We do not reproduce Thackeray’s own illustrations.\n>\n> I am checking into the text of VANITY FAIR to find out exactly what is\n> involved in producing a completely satisfactory book and will let you\n> know within a few days what I turn up. Next Friday Ray will be in town\n> and I have an appointment with him. Naturally I hope that I can at\n> that time assure him that we will put out a completely satisfactory\n> edition. At the moment the principal inexpensive editions of VANITY\n> FAIR that are available are Modern Library, Everyman’s Library, and\n> Great Illustrated Classics (Dodd, Mead, $2.50). Neither Harper nor\n> Rinehart has an edition of VANITY FAIR available right now, but\n> Rinehart does have one in preparation. It seems imperative therefore\n> that we have our edition of VANITY FAIR in improved form available\n> this fall (Stein memo to Haas, 10 February 1950).\n\nRay indicated that the 1864 edition with revisions by Thackeray should\nbe followed. Stein believed that the text of the 1933 ML edition\nfollowed Thackeray’s original text as published in parts, 1847–48. At\nfirst he hoped that the existing plates could be used for the new ML\nedition. He told Ray, “Naturally I don’t want our text to be one which\ndoes not have scholarly approval. I don’t know yet whether a collation\nor a resetting is our solution but we will do one or the other to bring\nthe text completely in line with the 1864 version. Because of production\ncosts I am not sure yet that the illustrations, vignettes and initial\nletters can be included in as moderately priced a book as we plan to\nhave” (Stein to Ray, 28 March 1950).\n\nIn the end the ML reset the text (Stein to Ray, 20 June 1950) and\nincluded eight of Thackeray’s illustrations along with facsimiles of the\ntitle page of the first edition and the wrapper of one of the original\nmonthly parts. Earlier ML printings (258.1) included the two facsimiles\nand three of Thackeray’s illustrations.\n\nRay appears to have declined Stein’s suggestion that he write an\nintroduction to *Vanity Fair* instead of *History of Henry Esmond*, and\nStein offered Joseph Warren Beach $200 to write the introduction. Beach\nreplied that he would take on the assignment for $500 but later agreed\nto accept the amount offered (Stein to Beach, 25 January 1950; Beach to\nStein, 27 January 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 27 February 1950).\n\nThe ML’s goal, Stein told Beach, was to produce “an inviting edition\nthat can be enjoyed by the American student as a novel as readable today\nas it was a century ago” (Stein to Beach, 23 May 1950). The Note on the\nText stated:\n\n> The present Modern Library edition of *Vanity Fair* is based on the\n> 1864 edition, which represents the final revisions made by Thackeray,\n> and is preferable to earlier editions as representing what Thackeray\n> considered improvements. Certain obvious misprints in the earlier and\n> later editions have been corrected. In the case of certain doubtful\n> readings we have followed the Oxford edition of *Vanity Fair* edited\n> by Saintsbury in 1908, but we have not always accepted Saintsbury’s\n> emendations. A few of Thackeray’s own full-page illustrations, of\n> which there were some forty in all, have been included—enough to give\n> a notion of the quaint visual aids offered the reader of what\n> Thackeray called “these histories in their gaudy yellow covers”; but\n> considerations of expense make it impossible to include the still more\n> numerous sketches at the head of each chapter or set into the text.\n> (p. xxiii)\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nThackeray, *History of Henry Esmond* (1936–1967) 297\n\n***Fall***\n\n### 259\n\n**EVELYN WAUGH.

Discontinued 1 January 1941.\n\nAfter Harcourt, Brace & Co. published Stein’s *Autobiography of Alice B.\nToklas* in 1933, Carl Van Vechten suggested that the ML bring out some\nof Stein’s earlier work. Cerf cabled Stein in Paris about a ML edition\nof *Three* *Lives* (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 101). RH subsequently became\nStein’s regular publisher, and a warm friendship developed between Cerf\nand Stein.\n\nThe ML acquired the plates and full publishing rights to *Three Lives*,\nand Van Vechten wrote a new introduction for the ML edition. Cerf\ninformed Stein a month after publication that “the book is proving to be\na tremendous success for us. It is causing more comment than any new\nModern Library title in the past two years. The firm of R. H. Macy &\nCo., which has probably the largest book department in the world today,\nhas bought the astonishing number of 1300 copies of this little book\nsince publication day less than a month ago. The total sale to date is\nover 4500 copies” (Cerf to Stein, 23 October 1933).\n\nSales appear to have dropped off in the later 1930s, and *Three Lives*\nwas discontinued at the end of 1940. Cerf persuaded James Laughlin of\nNew Directions to add *Three Lives* to their New Classics series in\n1941. New Directions used the ML’s plates, including Van Vechten’s\nintroduction, and paid the ML a $250 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. Cerf told Stein that she would receive $125 (her half of\nthe advance) from the New Directions edition in the next year alone\n(Cerf to Stein, 17 September 1941).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nStein, *Selected Writings* (1962–1971) 547\n\nStein, *Autobiography of Alice B.

The advance was reduced to $1,000 in the\ncontract dated 17 May 1933. The small type and dated nineteenth-century\ntypography of the “Player’s Edition” plates made *Ben-Hur* one of the\nleast attractive volumes in the series.

Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set of\n*Remembrance of Things Past* would be undermined if individual volumes\nappeared in the ML too rapidly. Cerf approached him again a few months\nlater with an offer that he hoped would entice Boni to release the work\nfor publication in spring 1932. He offered an advance of $1,500 payable\nimmediately, or $2,000 with half paid on signing and the balance on\npublication, against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Boni, 3 July\n1931). The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year\nand specified that the ML edition could not be published before October\n1933.

  "general": "*Publishers’ Weekly* reported that the Modern Library’s best-selling\nbooks for 1933 showed “a distinct change in the trend of interest of\nreaders. For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles,\nlike ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most\ninteresting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’\nedited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is\nstill selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers\nfor the year were: Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*, Faulkner,\n*Sanctuary*, Marx, *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other\nWritings*, Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*, Maugham, *Of Human Bondage*,\nMann, *The Magic Mountain*, Merejkowski, *The Romance of Leonardo da\nVinci*, Dostoyevsky, *The Brothers Karamazov*, Cather, *Death Comes for\nthe Archbishop*, and Rostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (“Modern Library Best\nSellers,” *PW*, 13 January 1934, p. 148).\n\nCerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing in 1933 after the\nbankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The firm had been through many changes\nsince Albert Boni’s departure in July 1918. The name Boni & Liveright\nwas used until fall 1928, three years after Cerf and Klopfer’s purchase\nof the Modern Library deprived the firm of its most reliable source of\nincome. The change of name to Horace Liveright, Inc., was largely due to\nconfusion with the firm, Albert & Charles Boni, which the Boni brothers\nestablished in 1923.\n\nLiveright borrowed money repeatedly from Arthur Pell, the firm’s\ntreasurer, giving him stock in the firm as collateral. By 1930 he had\nlost control of the firm of which he had been co-founder. When Pell\nemerged as the firm’s majority shareholder he forced Liveright to leave.\nLiveright moved to Hollywood where he worked briefly at Paramount and\nthen Pathé Studios before returning to New York in the summer of 1931,\nwhere he died two years later at the age of forty-nine. In December 1931\nPell changed the name of the firm to Liveright, Inc. Pell did what he\ncould to avert the slide into bankruptcy, but on 4 May 1933 three of its\ncreditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the firm\n(Gilmer, pp. 232-33). Other publishers rushed in to sign up the leading\nLiveright authors. Robinson Jeffers received thirteen telegrams from\npublishers the day the bankruptcy was announced (Melrich V. Rosenberg to\nCerf, 17 September 1933). Even more sought after was Eugene O’Neill,\nwhose plays, Cerf once noted, “sold like novels” (Gelb and Gelb, p.\n768). Cerf set out to get both authors, though he thought the odds\nagainst getting O’Neill were about fifteen to one (Cerf to Crowder, 23\nMay 1933).\n\nO’Neill relied on his friend Saxe Commins, who had recently become his\neditor at Liveright, to advise him on the choice of a new publisher.\nAfter examining the offers, Commins indicated a preference for Cerf and\nRandom House. As he explained later,\n\n> The reason for the choice was that I had known Bennett professionally\n> during the Liveright days and recognized in him the potential of an\n> imaginative, resourceful, adventurous and most trustworthy publisher.\n> From my first meeting with his partner, Donald S. Klopfer, I was\n> impressed by his quiet confidence, his reliability, and his good\n> sense. Subsequently . . . I was to learn of his many attributes, not\n> the least of which is his complete selflessness (Commins, quoted in\n> Dorothy Commins, *What Is an Editor?*, p. 26).\n\nCerf was invited to fly down to Sea Island, Georgia, to meet with\nO’Neill and Commins. O’Neill signed with Random House in June; Jeffers\nsigned a day or so later. One of the first acts of the reorganized\nLiveright Publishing Corporation was to deliver the plates of its books\nby O’Neill and Jeffers to the ML’s printers (Liveright Publishing, Inc.,\nto the Modern Library, Inc., 9 August 1933; reproduced in Egleston, pp.\n107–08).\n\nCerf and Klopfer also considered trying to get Theodore Dreiser, the\nmost important novelist on the Liveright list. After O’Neill and Jeffers\nsigned with Random House Klopfer composed a letter to Dreiser making an\noffer, but the letter, dated 20 June 1933, appears never to have been\nsent. The original as well as the carbon copy remains in the Random\nHouse Collection at Columbia University. One can only speculate why Cerf\nand Klopfer changed their minds. Cerf did not like Dreiser personally,\nand Dreiser was a notoriously difficult author to deal with. He\ndistrusted publishers in general and Jewish publishers in particular. In\nthe end, over a year after the Liveright bankruptcy, he signed with\nSimon and Schuster. He completed nothing of importance during the eight\nacrimonious years he remained with the firm. By 1939 he owed Simon and\nSchuster over ten thousand dollars in unearned advances and other\ncharges (Madison, p. 108).\n\nIn addition to O’Neill and Jeffers, Random House acquired the editorial\nservices of Saxe Commins. One of O’Neill’s conditions for coming to\nRandom House was that his editor come with him. Random House needed a\nfull-time editor if it was to become seriously involved in trade\npublishing, and Commins was developing into one of the best book editors\nof his generation. Already the editor of Eugene O’Neill, at Random House\nhe was to become renowned as the editor of William Faulkner and also of\nW. H. Auden, Isak Dinesen, Sinclair Lewis, James Michener, Budd\nSchulberg, Irwin Shaw, Stephen Spender, and many others. Commins started\nat Random House on 9 July 1933 and remained editor-in-chief until his\ndeath in 1958, a quarter of a century later.\n\nAfter merging two volumes by Maupassant into one and four volumes by\nWilde into two in 1932, the ML continued its efforts to make ML books a\nbetter value by adding *Erewhon Revisited* to its edition of Samuel\nButler’s *Erewhon* (146b).",
  "numberOfTitles": "Thirteen new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of titles in the regular ML to 211. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants series; by the end of 1933 the Giants included\neleven titles in twelve volumes.",
  "format": "All new titles except Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Arrowsmith* was ⅜\ninch taller and wider to accommodate the Harcourt, Brace plates.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in.

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include George Bernard Shaw’s plays in the ML\nand offered Dodd, Mead a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy for a volume consisting of *Man and Superman*, *St. Joan*, and\n*Androcles and the Lion* (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 8 February 1933). Shaw\nopposed inexpensive reprints of his works and kept tight control of his\ncopyrights, and it was only after his death in 1950 that the ML was able\nto include two volumes of his plays. (Shaw temporarily relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints in 1946, when he allowed Penguin Books to\npublish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of\n100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.) The only\nwork by Shaw that appeared in the ML during his lifetime was his early\nnovel, *An Unsocial Socialist* (15), which was published before the U.S.\nextended copyright protection to the works of foreign authors.\n\nWilla Cather was another author who was ambivalent about inexpensive\nreprints of her works. She allowed *Death Comes to the Archbishop* (219)\nto be included in the Modern Library in 1931 but subsequently asked\nKnopf not to renew the reprint contract. When Cerf tried to add Cather’s\n*My Antonia* to the series in 1933 Houghton Mifflin turned him down,\nprobably at Cather’s request (Dale Warren to Cerf, 30 October 1933).\n\nCerf contacted Farrar and Rinehart about including Hervey Allen’s\n*Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants in 1935 or 1936 (Cerf to John Farrar, 11\nAugust 1933). The historical novel sold 300,000 copies in its first six\nmonths and led the fiction best-seller list for two years (1933‑1934).\nFarrar and Rinehart does not appear to have authorized any reprint\nedition, not even by Grosset & Dunlap, the leading publisher of reprint\neditions for the mass market before the advent of paperbacks in 1939.\nCerf waited for five years and tried again in 1938 (see 1938 Titles\nsought, suggested, declined).\n\nCerf expressed interest in reprinting Ogden Nash’s selection from P. G.\nWodehouse’s works, *Nothing but Wodehouse* (Doubleday, Doran, 1932),\npossibly as a Giant—the volume ran to more than 1,000 pages—but\nDoubleday, Doran was reprinting it in a cheap edition of their own.\n\nOn a different note, Klopfer asked Max Eastman, whose Marx’s *Capital,\nThe Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings* (246) had been published in\nthe ML three months earlier, to translate the complete works of Lenin\nfor the ML, noting that it would be “a perfect follow-up book for the\nMarx” and “would create a great feeling of ill-will in this country, all\nof which we are very much for.” Five days later he wrote, “I am waiting\nwith baited breath to hear the length of the complete works of Lenin,\nwhen you would be able to do it, and how much you would want to do a new\ntranslation” (Klopfer to Eastman, 16 February and 21 February 1933).\nEastman replied that a volume of Lenin could be any length. He asked for\nan advance of five hundred dollars and a fee of one cent per word for\nthe translation. He noted, “Lenin’s style is an extraordinary\nphenomenon—you can feel the locomotive force of the man’s will in almost\nevery sentence—and it has never been reproduced in English” (Eastman to\nKlopfer, 16 March 1933). Klopfer responded that the ML would like a book\nof about 100,000 words (Klopfer to Eastman, 17 March 1933).\n\nEastman received the advance he asked for, but nearly a year went by\nbefore he began working on the Lenin book. Cerf wrote in April 1934,\n“These are times in which that book could sell marvelously well, and it\nwould be a shame to dilly-dally until somebody beats us to the gun. I\nbeseech you to get to work on it” (Cerf to Eastman, 4 April 1934). But\nEastman made little progress. Other work got in the way, and in August\nhe wrote to Cerf agreeing to an annulment of the contract. Eastman kept\nthe advance, which they agreed would be regarded as an advance for a\nfuture project (Eastman to Cerf, 30 August 1934). Cerf and Klopfer gave\nup the idea of including a Lenin volume in the ML. The only subsequent\nbook of Eastman’s to be published by Random House was *Love and\nRevolution: My Journey through an Epoch* (1964)*.*\n\nRobert de Graff, the president of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary\nGarden City Publishing Co., suggested Clemence Dane’s novel *Legend* for\nthe ML. Dane was the pseudonym of the English novelist, playwright, and\nscreenwriter Winifred Ashton. Cerf replied that he didn’t think she\nwould have much of a sale in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 27 January 1933;\nCerf to de Graff, 30 January 1933). Michael S. Mill, a publisher’s sales\nrepresentative, suggested a volume of Anthony Trollope; Cerf replied\nthat the ML would get around to it in the next couple of years (Cerf to\nMill, 28 July 1933). Trollope’s *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (292)\nwas added to the ML in 1936.\n\nFollowing the publication of Keats and Shelley’s *Complete Poetical\nWorks* (G4) in the new ML Giants series, Cerf and Klopfer considered a\nGiant devoted to the complete poems of Lord Byron. Robert Linscott of\nHoughton Mifflin Co. provided sales figures for the firm’s Cambridge\nEdition of *The Complete Poetical Works* *of Lord Byron* (1905). Trade\nsales for the three-year period 1930–32 totaled 1370 copies. Klopfer\nthanked him and noted, “I think that that conclusively proves we would\nnot be warranted in making a Giant of a complete Byron” (Klopfer to\nLinscott, 13 April 1933). The ML published Byron’s *Don Juan* (420) in\n1949 and *Selected Poetry* (465) in 1954.",

It is one of the imperishable classics of English fiction.\n> This volume is embellished by Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches.\n> (*Spring 1951*)\n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br>\n> When it was written over one hundred years ago, Thackeray described\n> *Vanity Fair* as “a novel without a hero.” If it did lack a central\n> protagonist, his great work more than compensated for this deliberate\n> omission with a gallery of memorable characters now known and beloved\n> by readers of every shade of taste and opinion. To be able to issue\n> *Vanity Fair*, with Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches, in a\n> single volume of 784 \\[*sic*\\] pages, complete and unabridged,\n> fulfills the first aim of the Modern Library: to make available the\n> greatest book treasures of the past and present in a convenient and\n> inexpensive form. (*Fall 1954*)\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.\n\nEarly in 1950 Stein contacted Gordon S. Ray, chairman of the English\ndepartment at the University of Illinois and the preeminent Thackeray\nscholar in the United States, to see if he would be willing to write an\nintroduction to the MLCE edition of *Vanity Fair* instead of Thackeray’s\n*History of Henry Esmond* (297) as previously arranged. Stein described\nthe conversation in a memo to Haas:\n\n> What came back over the telephone wire was a very blistering attack\n> upon our edition of VANITY FAIR. He said that he uses the edition in\n> his classes with reluctance and that he always apologizes to them for\n> having to use it. His principal points of complaint are:\n>\n> 1\\) Our edition is not based on the final text.\n>\n> 2\\) Our edition does not include Thackeray’s own preface to the book.\n>\n> 3\\) Our edition is full of typographic errors.\n>\n> 4\\) We do not reproduce Thackeray’s own illustrations.\n>\n> I am checking into the text of VANITY FAIR to find out exactly what is\n> involved in producing a completely satisfactory book and will let you\n> know within a few days what I turn up. Next Friday Ray will be in town\n> and I have an appointment with him. Naturally I hope that I can at\n> that time assure him that we will put out a completely satisfactory\n> edition. At the moment the principal inexpensive editions of VANITY\n> FAIR that are available are Modern Library, Everyman’s Library, and\n> Great Illustrated Classics (Dodd, Mead, $2.50). Neither Harper nor\n> Rinehart has an edition of VANITY FAIR available right now, but\n> Rinehart does have one in preparation. It seems imperative therefore\n> that we have our edition of VANITY FAIR in improved form available\n> this fall (Stein memo to Haas, 10 February 1950).\n\nRay indicated that the 1864 edition with revisions by Thackeray should\nbe followed. Stein believed that the text of the 1933 ML edition\nfollowed Thackeray’s original text as published in parts, 1847–48. At\nfirst he hoped that the existing plates could be used for the new ML\nedition. He told Ray, “Naturally I don’t want our text to be one which\ndoes not have scholarly approval. I don’t know yet whether a collation\nor a resetting is our solution but we will do one or the other to bring\nthe text completely in line with the 1864 version. Because of production\ncosts I am not sure yet that the illustrations, vignettes and initial\nletters can be included in as moderately priced a book as we plan to\nhave” (Stein to Ray, 28 March 1950).\n\nIn the end the ML reset the text (Stein to Ray, 20 June 1950) and\nincluded eight of Thackeray’s illustrations along with facsimiles of the\ntitle page of the first edition and the wrapper of one of the original\nmonthly parts. Earlier ML printings (258.1) included the two facsimiles\nand three of Thackeray’s illustrations.\n\nRay appears to have declined Stein’s suggestion that he write an\nintroduction to *Vanity Fair* instead of *History of Henry Esmond*, and\nStein offered Joseph Warren Beach $200 to write the introduction. Beach\nreplied that he would take on the assignment for $500 but later agreed\nto accept the amount offered (Stein to Beach, 25 January 1950; Beach to\nStein, 27 January 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 27 February 1950).\n\nThe ML’s goal, Stein told Beach, was to produce “an inviting edition\nthat can be enjoyed by the American student as a novel as readable today\nas it was a century ago” (Stein to Beach, 23 May 1950). The Note on the\nText stated:\n\n> The present Modern Library edition of *Vanity Fair* is based on the\n> 1864 edition, which represents the final revisions made by Thackeray,\n> and is preferable to earlier editions as representing what Thackeray\n> considered improvements. Certain obvious misprints in the earlier and\n> later editions have been corrected. In the case of certain doubtful\n> readings we have followed the Oxford edition of *Vanity Fair* edited\n> by Saintsbury in 1908, but we have not always accepted Saintsbury’s\n> emendations. A few of Thackeray’s own full-page illustrations, of\n> which there were some forty in all, have been included—enough to give\n> a notion of the quaint visual aids offered the reader of what\n> Thackeray called “these histories in their gaudy yellow covers”; but\n> considerations of expense make it impossible to include the still more\n> numerous sketches at the head of each chapter or set into the text.\n> (p. xxiii)\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nThackeray, *History of Henry Esmond* (1936–1967) 297\n\n***Fall***",
  "generalFirst": "*Publishers’ Weekly* reported that the Modern Library’s best-selling\nbooks for 1933 showed “a distinct change in the trend of interest of\nreaders. For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles,\nlike ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most\ninteresting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’\nedited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is\nstill selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers\nfor the year were: Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*, Faulkner,\n*Sanctuary*, Marx, *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other\nWritings*, Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*, Maugham, *Of Human Bondage*,\nMann, *The Magic Mountain*, Merejkowski, *The Romance of Leonardo da\nVinci*, Dostoyevsky, *The Brothers Karamazov*, Cather, *Death Comes for\nthe Archbishop*, and Rostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (“Modern Library Best\nSellers,” *PW*, 13 January 1934, p. 148).",

(*Fall 1932*)\n\nA. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,\n1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American\nbranch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made\nfrom a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively\nby the ML. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing:\n6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.\n\nThe original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.\nFor its edition of France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163), published in\n1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off\nthe running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the\nheadline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was\none of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf\nconsidered doing the same for *Penguin Island* (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4\nNovember 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The\nresult was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages\nshorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.\n\nThe ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the\ntranslator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years\nafter the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of\nthe title page of 253c, published in 1984.\n\nThe ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s\n(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)\nbut picked up in the 1940s. *Penguin Island* sold 4,876 copies during\nthe eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\nThe publication of *Penguin Island* brought the number of France’s works\nin the ML to five. *The Queen* *Pédauque* was discontinued at the end of\n1933; by the end of 1942 *Penguin Island* was the only title by France\nin the series.\n\n#### 253b.

First printing: 7,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1952.\n\nThe ML edition (254.1a) was larger than the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format\nso that it could be printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Publication of\nthe ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film\nversion starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the\nappearance of Lewis’s new novel *Ann Vickers.* The ML urged booksellers\nto feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement,\n*PW*, 14 January 1933, p. 98).\n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset & Dunlap,\nwhich also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace\nplates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the\noriginal Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier & Son.\n\n*Arrowsmith* sold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nSales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making\n*Arrowsmith* the thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153\ncopies ahead of Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*.\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college\nmarket. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s\nreprint contracts for *Arrowsmith*, Lewis’s *Babbitt*, and seven other\ntitles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton\nStrachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML,\n18 May 1948). The ML’s contract for *Arrowsmith* had four years to run.\nHarcourt, Brace confirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the\nfirm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1933. *WR* 29 April 1933. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by *Great German Short Novels\nand Stories*, ed. Victor Lange (451).\n\nThomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology\nof German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February\n1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed\nresponsibility for the anthology:\n\nIt was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a\nconsiderable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He\nexpressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract\nwas duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still\nroaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled.\nAt long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German\nauthors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with\nthe job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to\ngather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and\nexercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to\nthe publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the\nwastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)\n\nHitler came to power shortly before *Great German Short Novels and\nStories* was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the\nvolume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf,\n17 April 1933).\n\nWhen *Great German Short Novels and Stories* was being planned Cerf\ncontacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s *Death in Venice*,\noffering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a\nThomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been\npublished in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf\nhad published Kenneth Burke’s translation of *Death in Venice* as a\nseparate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T.\nLowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the\nout-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against\nroyalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.\n\n*Great German Short Novels and Stories* sold 4,450 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of\nthe second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n#### 256b.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1933 1933 *Publishers’ Weekly* reported that the Modern Library’s best-selling\nbooks for 1933 showed “a distinct change in the trend of interest of\nreaders. For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles,\nlike ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most\ninteresting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’\nedited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is\nstill selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers\nfor the year were: Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*, Faulkner,\n*Sanctuary*, Marx, *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other\nWritings*, Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*, Maugham, *Of Human Bondage*,\nMann, *The Magic Mountain*, Merejkowski, *The Romance of Leonardo da\nVinci*, Dostoyevsky, *The Brothers Karamazov*, Cather, *Death Comes for\nthe Archbishop*, and Rostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (“Modern Library Best\nSellers,” *PW*, 13 January 1934, p. 148).\n\nCerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing in 1933 after the\nbankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The firm had been through many changes\nsince Albert Boni’s departure in July 1918. The name Boni & Liveright\nwas used until fall 1928, three years after Cerf and Klopfer’s purchase\nof the Modern Library deprived the firm of its most reliable source of\nincome. The change of name to Horace Liveright, Inc., was largely due to\nconfusion with the firm, Albert & Charles Boni, which the Boni brothers\nestablished in 1923.\n\nLiveright borrowed money repeatedly from Arthur Pell, the firm’s\ntreasurer, giving him stock in the firm as collateral. By 1930 he had\nlost control of the firm of which he had been co-founder. When Pell\nemerged as the firm’s majority shareholder he forced Liveright to leave.\nLiveright moved to Hollywood where he worked briefly at Paramount and\nthen Pathé Studios before returning to New York in the summer of 1931,\nwhere he died two years later at the age of forty-nine. In December 1931\nPell changed the name of the firm to Liveright, Inc. Pell did what he\ncould to avert the slide into bankruptcy, but on 4 May 1933 three of its\ncreditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the firm\n(Gilmer, pp. 232-33). Other publishers rushed in to sign up the leading\nLiveright authors. Robinson Jeffers received thirteen telegrams from\npublishers the day the bankruptcy was announced (Melrich V. Rosenberg to\nCerf, 17 September 1933). Even more sought after was Eugene O’Neill,\nwhose plays, Cerf once noted, “sold like novels” (Gelb and Gelb, p.\n768). Cerf set out to get both authors, though he thought the odds\nagainst getting O’Neill were about fifteen to one (Cerf to Crowder, 23\nMay 1933).\n\nO’Neill relied on his friend Saxe Commins, who had recently become his\neditor at Liveright, to advise him on the choice of a new publisher.\nAfter examining the offers, Commins indicated a preference for Cerf and\nRandom House. As he explained later,\n\n> The reason for the choice was that I had known Bennett professionally\n> during the Liveright days and recognized in him the potential of an\n> imaginative, resourceful, adventurous and most trustworthy publisher.\n> From my first meeting with his partner, Donald S. Klopfer, I was\n> impressed by his quiet confidence, his reliability, and his good\n> sense. Subsequently . . . I was to learn of his many attributes, not\n> the least of which is his complete selflessness (Commins, quoted in\n> Dorothy Commins, *What Is an Editor?*, p. 26).\n\nCerf was invited to fly down to Sea Island, Georgia, to meet with\nO’Neill and Commins. O’Neill signed with Random House in June; Jeffers\nsigned a day or so later. One of the first acts of the reorganized\nLiveright Publishing Corporation was to deliver the plates of its books\nby O’Neill and Jeffers to the ML’s printers (Liveright Publishing, Inc.,\nto the Modern Library, Inc., 9 August 1933; reproduced in Egleston, pp.\n107–08).\n\nCerf and Klopfer also considered trying to get Theodore Dreiser, the\nmost important novelist on the Liveright list. After O’Neill and Jeffers\nsigned with Random House Klopfer composed a letter to Dreiser making an\noffer, but the letter, dated 20 June 1933, appears never to have been\nsent. The original as well as the carbon copy remains in the Random\nHouse Collection at Columbia University. One can only speculate why Cerf\nand Klopfer changed their minds. Cerf did not like Dreiser personally,\nand Dreiser was a notoriously difficult author to deal with. He\ndistrusted publishers in general and Jewish publishers in particular. In\nthe end, over a year after the Liveright bankruptcy, he signed with\nSimon and Schuster. He completed nothing of importance during the eight\nacrimonious years he remained with the firm. By 1939 he owed Simon and\nSchuster over ten thousand dollars in unearned advances and other\ncharges (Madison, p. 108).\n\nIn addition to O’Neill and Jeffers, Random House acquired the editorial\nservices of Saxe Commins. One of O’Neill’s conditions for coming to\nRandom House was that his editor come with him. Random House needed a\nfull-time editor if it was to become seriously involved in trade\npublishing, and Commins was developing into one of the best book editors\nof his generation. Already the editor of Eugene O’Neill, at Random House\nhe was to become renowned as the editor of William Faulkner and also of\nW. H. Auden, Isak Dinesen, Sinclair Lewis, James Michener, Budd\nSchulberg, Irwin Shaw, Stephen Spender, and many others. Commins started\nat Random House on 9 July 1933 and remained editor-in-chief until his\ndeath in 1958, a quarter of a century later.\n\nAfter merging two volumes by Maupassant into one and four volumes by\nWilde into two in 1932, the ML continued its efforts to make ML books a\nbetter value by adding *Erewhon Revisited* to its edition of Samuel\nButler’s *Erewhon* (146b). Thirteen new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of titles in the regular ML to 211. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants series; by the end of 1933 the Giants included\neleven titles in twelve volumes. All new titles except Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Arrowsmith* was ⅜\ninch taller and wider to accommodate the Harcourt, Brace plates.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type; torchbearer A2 was used on all but two new\ntitles. Ludwig, *Napoleon* (255) had torchbearer A7 and Louÿs,\n*Aphrodite* (257) had torchbearer C2. All new titles had the 3-line\nimprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprint of Louÿs, *Aphrodite* (257) differs from other 1933 titles\nin the first line of the imprint, which has a colon rather than a dot\nbetween Cerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll newly published titles had individually designed pictorial jackets\nexcept Gertrude Stein’s *Three Lives* (261) which had a distinctive\nnon-pictorial jacket designed by Ernst Reichl. Reichl was also\nresponsible for designing the Random House edition of Joyce’s *Ulysses*,\npublished in January 1934.\n\nBeginning in August with Brontë, *Jane Eyre* (160), descriptive text\nabout the work replaced generic information about the series on the\nfront jacket flaps of newly published ML titles. The flap text was\nwritten by Saxe Commins, who joined the firm as editor in July. 95 cents. (Spring) Lewis, *Arrowsmith* xStein, *Three Lives*; Giants through G10.\n(Fall) Stein, *Three Lives* xCaldwell, *God’s Little Acre*; Giants\nthrough G12; jackets: 225 (=spring, fall 1934). Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include George Bernard Shaw’s plays in the ML\nand offered Dodd, Mead a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy for a volume consisting of *Man and Superman*, *St. Joan*, and\n*Androcles and the Lion* (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 8 February 1933). Shaw\nopposed inexpensive reprints of his works and kept tight control of his\ncopyrights, and it was only after his death in 1950 that the ML was able\nto include two volumes of his plays. (Shaw temporarily relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints in 1946, when he allowed Penguin Books to\npublish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of\n100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.) The only\nwork by Shaw that appeared in the ML during his lifetime was his early\nnovel, *An Unsocial Socialist* (15), which was published before the U.S.\nextended copyright protection to the works of foreign authors.\n\nWilla Cather was another author who was ambivalent about inexpensive\nreprints of her works. She allowed *Death Comes to the Archbishop* (219)\nto be included in the Modern Library in 1931 but subsequently asked\nKnopf not to renew the reprint contract. When Cerf tried to add Cather’s\n*My Antonia* to the series in 1933 Houghton Mifflin turned him down,\nprobably at Cather’s request (Dale Warren to Cerf, 30 October 1933).\n\nCerf contacted Farrar and Rinehart about including Hervey Allen’s\n*Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants in 1935 or 1936 (Cerf to John Farrar, 11\nAugust 1933). The historical novel sold 300,000 copies in its first six\nmonths and led the fiction best-seller list for two years (1933‑1934).\nFarrar and Rinehart does not appear to have authorized any reprint\nedition, not even by Grosset & Dunlap, the leading publisher of reprint\neditions for the mass market before the advent of paperbacks in 1939.\nCerf waited for five years and tried again in 1938 (see 1938 Titles\nsought, suggested, declined).\n\nCerf expressed interest in reprinting Ogden Nash’s selection from P. G.\nWodehouse’s works, *Nothing but Wodehouse* (Doubleday, Doran, 1932),\npossibly as a Giant—the volume ran to more than 1,000 pages—but\nDoubleday, Doran was reprinting it in a cheap edition of their own.\n\nOn a different note, Klopfer asked Max Eastman, whose Marx’s *Capital,\nThe Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings* (246) had been published in\nthe ML three months earlier, to translate the complete works of Lenin\nfor the ML, noting that it would be “a perfect follow-up book for the\nMarx” and “would create a great feeling of ill-will in this country, all\nof which we are very much for.” Five days later he wrote, “I am waiting\nwith baited breath to hear the length of the complete works of Lenin,\nwhen you would be able to do it, and how much you would want to do a new\ntranslation” (Klopfer to Eastman, 16 February and 21 February 1933).\nEastman replied that a volume of Lenin could be any length. He asked for\nan advance of five hundred dollars and a fee of one cent per word for\nthe translation. He noted, “Lenin’s style is an extraordinary\nphenomenon—you can feel the locomotive force of the man’s will in almost\nevery sentence—and it has never been reproduced in English” (Eastman to\nKlopfer, 16 March 1933). Klopfer responded that the ML would like a book\nof about 100,000 words (Klopfer to Eastman, 17 March 1933).\n\nEastman received the advance he asked for, but nearly a year went by\nbefore he began working on the Lenin book. Cerf wrote in April 1934,\n“These are times in which that book could sell marvelously well, and it\nwould be a shame to dilly-dally until somebody beats us to the gun. I\nbeseech you to get to work on it” (Cerf to Eastman, 4 April 1934). But\nEastman made little progress. Other work got in the way, and in August\nhe wrote to Cerf agreeing to an annulment of the contract. Eastman kept\nthe advance, which they agreed would be regarded as an advance for a\nfuture project (Eastman to Cerf, 30 August 1934). Cerf and Klopfer gave\nup the idea of including a Lenin volume in the ML. The only subsequent\nbook of Eastman’s to be published by Random House was *Love and\nRevolution: My Journey through an Epoch* (1964)*.*\n\nRobert de Graff, the president of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary\nGarden City Publishing Co., suggested Clemence Dane’s novel *Legend* for\nthe ML. Dane was the pseudonym of the English novelist, playwright, and\nscreenwriter Winifred Ashton. Cerf replied that he didn’t think she\nwould have much of a sale in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 27 January 1933;\nCerf to de Graff, 30 January 1933). Michael S. Mill, a publisher’s sales\nrepresentative, suggested a volume of Anthony Trollope; Cerf replied\nthat the ML would get around to it in the next couple of years (Cerf to\nMill, 28 July 1933). Trollope’s *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (292)\nwas added to the ML in 1936.\n\nFollowing the publication of Keats and Shelley’s *Complete Poetical\nWorks* (G4) in the new ML Giants series, Cerf and Klopfer considered a\nGiant devoted to the complete poems of Lord Byron. Robert Linscott of\nHoughton Mifflin Co. provided sales figures for the firm’s Cambridge\nEdition of *The Complete Poetical Works* *of Lord Byron* (1905). Trade\nsales for the three-year period 1930–32 totaled 1370 copies. Klopfer\nthanked him and noted, “I think that that conclusively proves we would\nnot be warranted in making a Giant of a complete Byron” (Klopfer to\nLinscott, 13 April 1933). The ML published Byron’s *Don Juan* (420) in\n1949 and *Selected Poetry* (465) in 1954. Huxley, *Antic Hay* (1933) 252\n\nFrance, *Penguin Island* (1933) 253\n\nLewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933) 254\n\nLudwig, *Napoleon* (1933) 255\n\nCerf, ed., *Great German Short Novels and Stories* (1933) 256\n\nLouÿs, *Aphrodite* (1933) 257\n\nThackeray, *Vanity Fair* (1933) 258\n\nWaugh, *Vile Bodies* (1933) 259\n\nBrontë, *Jane Eyre* (1933) 260\n\nStein, *Three Lives* (1933) 261\n\nWallace, *Ben-Hur* (1933) 262\n\nStrachey, *Eminent Victorians* (1933) 263\n\nProust*, Guermantes Way* (1933) 264 *Publishers’ Weekly* reported that the Modern Library’s best-selling\nbooks for 1933 showed “a distinct change in the trend of interest of\nreaders.
