<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1940</h1>
<h2>1940</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>By 1940, Cerf and Klopfer had been in charge of the ML for nearly fifteen years. Many titles inherited from Boni &amp; Liveright were discontinued in the 1930s; by 1940, less than a third of the Boni &amp; Liveright titles remained. ML Giants joined the regular ML series in 1931. By spring 1940, regular titles and Giants together numbered 270 titles—two-and-a-half times the size of the series when Cerf and Klopfer acquired it.</p>
<p>The increased representation of American authors in the ML that began in the 1930s continued. By 1940, 28 percent of the authors in the regular series were Americans, compared to 20 percent in 1930. Even so, British authors remained in first place, accounting for 36 percent of the regular series. There was a marked falling off of French authors from 18 percent in 1930 to 11 percent in 1940. This decline reflected the large number of French titles—most of which were inherited from Boni &amp; Liveright days—that were dropped during the 1930s.</p>
<p>By 1940, the regular ML was a series of predominately modern works. In 1940, 22 percent of the titles were works dating from the preceding 20 years. In spring 1940, works first published between 1881 and 1900 made up just 15 percent of the regular ML series, compared with 34 percent in 1930 and 26 percent in 1925.</p>
<p>The tendency toward making the ML more middlebrow was reflected in an increased proportion of fiction. By spring 1940, fiction accounted for 64 percent of the regular ML. That was the highest proportion of fiction the ML would ever contain.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Eleven new titles were added to the ML and nine were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular series to 219. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1940 ML Giants included fifty-two titles in fifty-four volumes.</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>Beginning in 1940, ML title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. Existing titles acquired new title pages as they were reprinted. Blumenthal created the new title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s new format (7¼ x 4⅞ inches, enlarged from 6⅝ x 4⅜ inches) was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards and were sturdier than the ML’s earlier bindings. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination.</p>
<p>The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold on all titles published 1940–1962.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>An enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s larger format, was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged; the surrounding pattern of open books and “ml” initials was extended to fill the larger space. The spring endpapers, like earlier Kent endpapers, were in moderate orange; fall 1940 endpapers were in gray. Kent endpapers in gray remained in use through spring 1966. New titles published in fall 1966 and spring 1967 had Kent endpapers in light yellowish brown. New endpapers designed by S. Neil Fujita were introduced in fall 1967 as part of a comprehensive redesign of the series.</p>
<h3>Jackets</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Five titles (Sheean, <em>Personal History</em>; Marquand, <em>The Late George Apley</em>; Forester, <em>The African Queen</em>; Porter, <em>Flowering Judas and Other Stories</em>; and Emerson, <em>The Complete Essays and Other Writings</em>) had pictorial jackets. Six (Chaucer, <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>; Machiavelli, <em>The Prince and The Discourses</em>; Lewisohn, <em>The Island Within</em>; Forster, <em>A Passage to India</em>; <em>The Short Bible</em>; and Morley, <em>Human Being</em>) had non-pictorial jackets. The jackets for <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, Machiavelli, Lewisohn, and Forster were clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many for older titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Chaucer, <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> xEmerson, <em>Complete Essays</em>; Giants through G51; jackets: 271 (=spring 1941). (Fall) Emerson, <em>Complete Essays</em> xHugo, <em>Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>; Giants through G54; jackets: 274.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost (Cerf to Holt &amp; Co., 12 February 1940), but it would be 1946 before <em>The Poems of Robert Frost</em> (393) appeared in the ML. Cerf tried again to get Rudyard Kipling’s <em>Kim</em> for the ML, offering an advance of $2,000 against 10 cents a copy royalties for reprint rights (Cerf to Van Cartmell, Doubleday, Doran, 27 February 1940). It would be another decade before the ML secured reprint rights to Kipling’s novel. Cerf also sought Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings’s <em>The Yearling</em>, which was published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1938, became the year’s best-selling novel, and won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. He indicated that he wanted to publish it in 1942 (Cerf to Max Perkins, 11 April 1940). Scribner’s did not grant reprint rights to the ML until 1946. The ML edition of <em>The Yearling</em> (391) appeared late in 1946.</p>
<p>Several other titles to which Cerf tried to secure reprint rights never appeared in the series. He offered advances of $1,000 against royalties of 10 cents a copy for <em>The Collected Poems of T. S. Eliot</em> and Lytton Strachey’s <em>Queen Victoria</em> (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 26 April 1940; Cerf to Donald Brace, 3 May 1940). He had been trying to get <em>Queen Victoria</em> for the ML since 1928. He also wanted to publish William Graham Sumner’s <em>Folkways</em> as an ML Giant. He offered Ginn &amp; Co., who first published it in 1906, a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. “Judging by our sales of similar volumes of the series,” he wrote, “I think it fair to assume that we will sell these 10,000 copies within a year and a half, and that thereafter the book should sell between 2000 and 4000 copies every year. . . .” (Cerf to Richard Thornton, Ginn &amp; Co., 16 August 1940). Thornton declined the offer: “We still have a fair sale for the book, and we have recently put out a special Centennial Edition [Sumner was born in 1840], which we have been giving extra promotion” (Thornton to Cerf, 25 September 1940).</p>
<p>Cerf received a suggestion for Alfred Thayer Mahan’s <em>Influence of Sea Power upon History</em>, but after seeing a copy he concluded it was “too special in its appeal—and dated, too—to be a likely candidate for ML” (Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 April 1940).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> Vincent Sheean’s book is far more than its title implies; it is history in the making, a vivid interpretation of the ideas and struggles that have so suddenly changed our conception of the modern world. An eye-witness of violent events, the friend and confidant of men and women of power and influence, he has been able to give to this book an authority and intensity that few of the long succession of volumes fashioned on it have been able to attain. <em>Personal History</em> is a book of lasting importance.

<p>Flap text revised:  <br> The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel for 1938, <em>The Late George Apley</em> is a deft and devastating satire on the most proper of Bostonians when they were the self-appointed guardians of America’s social and intellectual destiny. Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s pretensions and his discomfiture, you will relish this rich portrait of a New England family with its background of rigid Puritanism. The tone throughout this novel is gentle, compassionate and ironic; its total purpose and achievement is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a passing but still warmly human American way of life.

<p>The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The initial reprint contract was for a period of three years and appears to have given the ML exclusive reprint rights. When the contract was renewed Little, Brown added a stipulation that gave them the option of authorizing a Pocket Books paperback edition (Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, to Cerf, 29 September 1943). The ML edition sold 6,118 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles during this eighteen-month period. Sales to September 1943 totaled 13,450 copies (Cerf to Elizabeth Marden, Little, Brown, 24 September 1943).</p>

<p>Front flap: <br> The addition of Chaucer’s <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> in a modern verse rendering to the Modern Library series is a boon to readers everywhere. For students in our schools and colleges especially it provides a scholarly and readable version of what is considered by the most eminent authorities to be, with <em>The</em> <em>Canterbury Tales</em> (No. 161), Chaucer’s greatest achievement. Originally published under the Random House imprint in a volume which sold at $3.50, it is now issued in an entirely new edition at a price within the reach of everybody. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Krapp translation originally published by Random House, 1932, with wood engravings by Eric Gill on the outer margins of facing pages (verso and recto) and full page wood engravings at the beginning of each of the five parts. Trade edition published from a new typesetting that closely follows that of the 1932 edition, with illustrations omitted and page numerals shifted from the head of the page at the outer margins to the foot of the page at the center. The trade edition is ⅜ inch larger than the ML edition and appears to have been published shortly before or simultaneously with the ML edition. ML edition (pp. v–309) printed from plates of the RH trade edition. The only significant differences between the two printings are the title leaf and half title: the RH half title is in Trafton script and the ML half title is in roman type. Published January 1940. <em>WR</em> 27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1944.</p>
<p>The ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful and was discontinued after less than five years. In 1957, thirteen years after the ML edition was discontinued, Random House used the ML plates to publish <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> in Modern Library Paperbacks, its trade paperback imprint. After Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960 the Knopf paperback series, Vintage Books, became Random House’s primary trade paperback imprint. Subsequent printings of <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> appeared in Vintage Books.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> Nothing could be more timely than the publication at this moment of history of the two works which made Machiavelli both famous and infamous as a model for contemporary statesmen. <em>The Prince</em> and <em>The Discourses</em> have become required reading for an understanding of our daily newspaper headlines. These books have never before been printed in a single volume. The texts are complete and unabridged. An illuminating introduction is provided by Max Lerner of Williams College and until recently editor of <em>The Nation</em>. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ricci translation of <em>The Prince</em> originally published in London in World’s Classics, 1906; Vincent revision originally published in World’s Classics, 1935. Detmold translation of <em>The Discourses</em> originally published by James R. Osgood &amp; Co., 1882, as part of Machiavelli’s <em>Historical, Political, and Diplomatic Writings</em>. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1940. <em>WR</em> 6 April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.</p>
<p>Machiavelli was included in the ML at Max Lerner’s recommendation. Lerner received $75 for the introduction, $25 more than the ML’s usual fee (Cerf to Linscott, 30 August 1940). The ML edition sold 8,721 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943 and 4,634 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it securely in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both of these periods. Sales totaled 114,857 copies by spring 1958.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML. When Machiavelli was included on the first list of titles to be included in MLCE, Stein offered Lerner $50 to add the bibliography and make any changes he wanted in the introduction (Stein to Lerner, 27 January 1950). Lerner made a number of small changes, including the addition of two sentences within the last paragraph, which begins with the sentence “Machiavelli sought to distinguish the realm of what ought to be and the realm of what is.”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be realistic about methods in the politics of a democracy at home does not mean that you throw away all scruples, or accept the superior force of “reason of state,” or embrace the police-state crushing of constitutional liberties. To be realistic about the massing of power abroad in the economic and ideological struggle for the support of men and women throughout the world does not mean that you abandon the struggle for peace and for a constitutional imperium that can grow into a world republic.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> The appeal to conscience and the lyrical quality of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writing make <em>The Island Within</em> his most notable novel. In it he recounts the age-old plight of the man of integrity who must struggle alone against the evil forces of prejudice and reaction. With an unerring insight into the Jewish spirit, Mr. Lewisohn reveals the nobility of a people reflected by one of its sons in the modern world. The story he tells is rich in imagery and immensely rewarding to the reader who demands fiction with meaning and emotion. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>

<p>The ML paid Harper’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. Lewisohn repeatedly urged Cerf to add <em>The Island Within</em> to the ML although two of his books, <em>Up Stream</em> (128) and <em>The Story of American Literature</em> (G43), were already in the series. Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place. Lewisohn approved of this step with all the vociferousness at his command, which, I need scarcely tell you, is quelquechose [<em>sic</em>]” (Cerf to Canfield, Harper &amp; Bros., 12 October 1939).</p>
<p><em>The Island Within</em> was discontinued after two and a half years because of poor sales. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.</p>

<p>Front flap: <br> The fame of E. M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em> grows with the passage of time. When it first appeared, in 1924, critics everywhere acclaimed it as a brilliant novel which upheld the highest traditions of English fiction. In the intervening fifteen years, it has established itself with the general public as a twentieth-century classic. Its subtle characterizations, its deep understanding of the Eastern mind, and its serene spirit make it a story to be cherished by a world from which all tranquillity seems to have departed.

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1924. ML edition (pp. [5]–322) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published April 1940. <em>WR</em> 6 April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1949.</p>
<p>Cerf tried to include <em>A Passage to India</em> in the ML shortly after he and Klopfer acquired the series (Cerf to Alfred Harcourt, 10 March 1926). Harcourt, Brace was agreeable but decided to ask Forster’s permission. Nine months later Harcourt reported, “The upshot of our correspondence with him is that we are forced to the decision not to sell this book to The Modern Library for next year” (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 11 December 1926). <em>A Passage to India</em> did not appear in the ML until thirteen years later.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Second World War, Harcourt, Brace launched its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for <em>A Passage to India</em> and eight other titles, including works by Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 3,300 copies of <em>A Passage to India</em> in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948). <em>A Passage to India</em> sold 6,654 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Total ML sales were 48,110 copies (B. J. Kirkpatrick, <em>E. M. Forster</em>, p. 34).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> The editors of this volume were guided entirely by the principle of clarifying for the modern American reader all the obscurities of the Bible in its standard forms. They have emphasized the religious and literary qualities of the Book of books, and have made it easy to read and understand. The historical background of each book is traced in simple and succinct commentaries, and the very arrangement of the books themselves, in the probable order of their writing, throws new light on the development of religious thought. <em>The Short Bible</em> is a boon to those who seek its essential truth and beauty. (<em>Fall 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by University of Chicago Press, 1933. ML edition (pp. v–[549]) printed from University of Chicago Press plates. Published September 1940. <em>WR</em> 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p><em>The Short Bible</em> was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed to secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s <em>The Complete Bible: An American Translation</em> (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they wanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a $5,000 advance for <em>The Complete Bible</em> ($3,000 on signing and $2,000 one year after publication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think we could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to Donald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the University of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of <em>The Complete Bible</em> was premature, Cerf offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for <em>The Short Bible</em> (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939). Shortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean to run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became Acting Manager of the Press.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting <em>The Complete Bible</em>. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with Goodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the complete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to the Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from California he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and Goodspeed had decided against a ML edition of <em>The Short Bible</em>. He reported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . . you and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up the Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until we can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant edition of the <em>Complete Bible</em>. I told him that we both understand full well that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but if we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to guarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of our contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December 1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).</p>
<p>Lewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead with <em>The Short Bible</em>. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell well, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML rejected it, and that whichever firm got <em>The Short Bible</em> would have a “toe-hold” on <em>The Complete Bible</em>. He recommended that the ML secure <em>The Short Bible</em> on the understanding that it would get <em>The Complete Bible</em> if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and Klopfer’s concern that a ML edition of <em>The Short Bible</em> might injure their chances of getting <em>The Complete Bible</em> if it sold poorly but concluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23 February 1940).</p>
<p>Cerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three days later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for <em>The Short Bible</em> was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After signing Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a reprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given the first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this edition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).</p>
<p>Two years later Cerf offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights to <em>The Complete Bible</em>. Hemens replied that it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be different the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to Cerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that many readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have the complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really impressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). <em>The Complete Bible</em> never appeared in the ML.</p>
<p>The text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted and abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago Press jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and appealing than that of the original edition.</p>
<p>The ML edition of <em>The Short Bible</em> sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional printings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and printings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January 1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML titles.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> Readers of <em>The General</em> and <em>Captain Horatio Hornblower</em> will welcome the revival of <em>The African Queen</em> in the Modern Library series. In C. S. Forester’s happiest vein, this fabulous tale maintains from first page to last its breathless excitement. An asthmatic steam launch carries a timid Cockney and a maidenly English missionary on a river in Central Africa to the adventure of their lives. Romance triumphs over fate, tropical heat and whizzing bullets. <em>The African Queen</em> is a story to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime. (<em>Fall 1940</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1935, with the last four chapters of the British edition omitted. ML edition (pp. [1]–275) printed from Little, Brown plates with the last four chapters restored. Chapters 16–19 (pp. 276–[308]) printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1940. <em>WR</em> 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf had never read <em>The African Queen</em>. He asked Little, Brown for a copy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about an hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that it was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years before the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.</p>
<p>Forester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters omitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the foreword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in writing another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the end of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end without calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was called for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and it was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I really appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked of its last two [<em>sic</em>] chapters. . . . So it is with very great pleasure that I welcome this reissue of <em>The African Queen</em> for the opportunity it gives me of presenting the book in the form in which I first pictured it” (p. [<em>8</em>]).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> The few, exquisitely wrought tales written by Katherine Anne Porter have firmly established her reputation as one of the masters of the short-story form. Critics have vied with one another in lavishing their praise for the crystalline quality of her prose, and her public has grown in ever-widening circles, until now the devotees of her writings include the most discriminating readers in America. <em>Flowering Judas and Other Stories</em> takes an honored place on the Modern Library shelf as a collection of short tales worthy of the illustrious company of great writers already represented in the series.

Both rank high in the honored company of world-famous writers of short stories represented in the series. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1935. ML edition (pp. [<em>9</em>]–285) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published September 1940 as ML 88. <em>WR</em> 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1950; restored spring 1953 as ML 284. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $250 advance, and Porter received $25 for her introduction. In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was pleased that <em>Flowering Judas</em> was to be included in the series. She wrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I hope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a buyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library a God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have more.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly, a kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book; authors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little on the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8 May 1940).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier that year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book sells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of letting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).</p>
<p>When Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was terminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400 copies of <em>Flowering Judas</em> in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it would take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued in fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s <em>Light in August</em> (429), which was published in the series shortly after <em>Flowering Judas</em> was discontinued.</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including <em>Flowering Judas</em> in Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring 1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and assigned <em>Flowering Judas</em> a new number (ML 284). Some copies of the 1946 ML printing that remained in the warehouse were sold in the spring 1953 jacket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The volume includes the Essays First Series, Essays Second Series and English Traits which the editors presumably regard as the only volumes of essays that Emerson assembled. <em>The Conduct of Life</em>, from which they have excerpted two sections, apparently is considered a whole book and not a collection of essays, but this is an ambiguous point and I think it would be much less confusing to have the title of this book changed to THE SELECTED WRITINGS OF RALPH WALDO EMERSON (Epstein memo to Cerf, 12 January 1960).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Writing of <em>Human Being</em>, Edna Ferber said: “It is a glorious book, a wise and deeply understanding book. It has a touch of God in it, and the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, <em>Kitty Foyle</em>, as well as those who have yet to experience their first acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of <em>Human Being</em>. (<em>Fall 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1932; rights subsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>–<em>7</em>], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a correction requested by Morley. Published October 1940. <em>WR</em> 12 October 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.</p>
<p>The suggestion to include <em>Human Being</em> in the ML came from Morley himself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little to see myself represented in there only by <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em>; a worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look at it now.
I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in <em>Human Being</em>, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person; a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be represented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I don’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be added; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley backlist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern Library” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted that he had never read <em>Human Being</em> and asked Morley to send him a copy (Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he still thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general interest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think that a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was able to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf to Morley, 30 August 1939).</p>
<p>Morley’s novel <em>Kitty Foyle</em> was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing <em>Human Being</em> in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would prefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf agreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob [Haas] and I still think it is a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and the huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to Morley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition corrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.</p>
<p><em>Human Being</em> sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that category. <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em> (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was the second worst-selling title.</p>
<p>There was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By February 1944 sales of the ML edition of <em>Human Being</em> exceeded 6,000 copies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).</p>

Many titles inherited from Boni & Liveright were discontinued in the 1930s; by 1940, less than a third of the Boni & Liveright titles remained. ML Giants joined the regular ML series in 1931. By spring 1940, regular titles and Giants together numbered 270 titles—two-and-a-half times the size of the series when Cerf and Klopfer acquired it.  \n\nThe increased representation of American authors in the ML that began in the 1930s continued. By 1940, 28 percent of the authors in the regular series were Americans, compared to 20 percent in 1930. Even so, British authors remained in first place, accounting for 36 percent of the regular series. There was a marked falling off of French authors from 18 percent in 1930 to 11 percent in 1940. This decline reflected the large number of French titles—most of which were inherited from Boni & Liveright days—that were dropped during the 1930s.  \n\nBy 1940, the regular ML was a series of predominately modern works. In 1940, 22 percent of the titles were works dating from the preceding 20 years. In spring 1940, works first published between 1881 and 1900 made up just 15 percent of the regular ML series, compared with 34 percent in 1930 and 26 percent in 1925.  \n\nThe tendency toward making the ML more middlebrow was reflected in an increased proportion of fiction. By spring 1940, fiction accounted for 64 percent of the regular ML. That was the highest proportion of fiction the ML would ever contain.  \n\n### Number of titles  \n\nEleven new titles were added to the ML and nine were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular series to 219. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1940 ML Giants included fifty-two titles in fifty-four volumes.  \n\n### Title page  \n\nBeginning in 1940, ML title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. Existing titles acquired new title pages as they were reprinted. Blumenthal created the new title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer.  \n\n### Binding  \n\nThe binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s new format (7¼ x 4⅞ inches, enlarged from 6⅝ x 4⅜ inches) was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards and were sturdier than the ML’s earlier bindings. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination.  \n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold on all titles published 1940–1962.  \n\n### Endpaper  \n\nAn enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s larger format, was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged; the surrounding pattern of open books and “ml” initials was extended to fill the larger space. The spring endpapers, like earlier Kent endpapers, were in moderate orange; fall 1940 endpapers were in gray. Kent endpapers in gray remained in use through spring 1966. New titles published in fall 1966 and spring 1967 had Kent endpapers in light yellowish brown. New endpapers designed by S. Neil Fujita were introduced in fall 1967 as part of a comprehensive redesign of the series.  \n\n### Jackets  \n\nAll new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Five titles (Sheean, *Personal History*; Marquand, *The Late George Apley*; Forester, *The African Queen*; Porter, *Flowering Judas and Other Stories*; and Emerson, *The Complete Essays and Other Writings*) had pictorial jackets. Six (Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida*; Machiavelli, *The Prince and The Discourses*; Lewisohn, *The Island Within*; Forster, *A Passage to India*; *The Short Bible*; and Morley, *Human Being*) had non-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Troilus and Cressida*, Machiavelli, Lewisohn, and Forster were clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many for older titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed.  \n\n### Price  \n\n95 cents.  \n\n### Dating keys  \n\n(Spring) Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida* xEmerson, *Complete Essays*; Giants through G51; jackets: 271 (=spring 1941). (Fall) Emerson, *Complete Essays* xHugo, *Hunchback of Notre Dame*; Giants through G54; jackets: 274.  \n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined  \n\nCerf expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940), but it would be 1946 before *The Poems of Robert Frost* (393) appeared in the ML. Cerf tried again to get Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* for the ML, offering an advance of \\$2,000 against 10 cents a copy royalties for reprint rights (Cerf to Van Cartmell, Doubleday, Doran, 27 February 1940). It would be another decade before the ML secured reprint rights to Kipling’s novel. Cerf also sought Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings’s *The Yearling*, which was published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1938, became the year’s best-selling novel, and won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. He indicated that he wanted to publish it in 1942 (Cerf to Max Perkins, 11 April 1940). Scribner’s did not grant reprint rights to the ML until 1946. The ML edition of *The Yearling* (391) appeared late in 1946.  \n\nSeveral other titles to which Cerf tried to secure reprint rights never appeared in the series. He offered advances of \\$1,000 against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *The Collected Poems of T. S. Eliot* and Lytton Strachey’s *Queen Victoria* (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 26 April 1940; Cerf to Donald Brace, 3 May 1940). He had been trying to get *Queen Victoria* for the ML since 1928. He also wanted to publish William Graham Sumner’s *Folkways* as an ML Giant. He offered Ginn & Co., who first published it in 1906, a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. “Judging by our sales of similar volumes of the series,” he wrote, “I think it fair to assume that we will sell these 10,000 copies within a year and a half, and that thereafter the book should sell between 2000 and 4000 copies every year. . . .” (Cerf to Richard Thornton, Ginn & Co., 16 August 1940). Thornton declined the offer: “We still have a fair sale for the book, and we have recently put out a special Centennial Edition [Sumner was born in 1840], which we have been giving extra promotion” (Thornton to Cerf, 25 September 1940).  \n\nCerf received a suggestion for Alfred Thayer Mahan’s *Influence of Sea Power upon History*, but after seeing a copy he concluded it was “too special in its appeal—and dated, too—to be a likely candidate for ML” (Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 April 1940).  \n\n### New titles  \nSheean, *Personal History* (1940) 325  \nMarquand, *Late George Apley* (1940) 326  \nChaucer, *Troilus and Cressida* (1940) 327  \nMachiavelli, *The Prince & The Discourses* (1940) 328  \nLewisohn, *Island Within* (1940) 329  \nForster, *Passage to India* (1940) 330  \nGoodspeed and Smith, eds., *Short Bible* (1940) 331  \nForester, *African Queen* (1940) 332  \nPorter, *Flowering Judas and Other Stories* (1940–1950; 1953) 333  \nEmerson, *Complete Essays and Other Writings* (1940–1960); *Selected Writings* (1960) 334  \nMorley, *Human Being* (1940) 335\n\n### Discontinued  \nBlake, *Poems* (1921)  \nCabell, *Cream of the Jest* (1927)  \nCrane, *Maggie, A Girl of the Streets and Other Stories* (1933)  \nDos Passos, *42nd Parallel* (1937)\\*  \nDowson, *Poems and Prose* (1919)  \nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (1926)  \nMann, *Buddenbrooks* (1935)  \nRichardson, *Maurice Guest* (1936)  \nSchnitzler, *Reigen, The Affairs of Anatol and Other Plays* (1933)  \n\n\\*Dos Passos’s *42nd Parallel* was discontinued after the ML published Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.* trilogy as a Giant in 1939.  \n\n***Spring***  \n\n### 325  \n\n**VINCENT SHEEAN.

To be realistic about the massing of power abroad in the economic and ideological struggle for the support of men and women throughout the world does not mean that you abandon the struggle for peace and for a constitutional imperium that can grow into a world republic. \n\n### 329\n\n**LUDWIG LEWISOHN.

The story he tells is rich in imagery and immensely rewarding to the reader who demands fiction with meaning and emotion. (*Spring 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Brothers, 1928.

Lewisohn repeatedly urged Cerf to add *The Island Within* to the ML although two of his books, *Up Stream* (128) and *The Story of American Literature* (G43), were already in the series. Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place. Lewisohn approved of this step with all the vociferousness at his command, which, I need scarcely tell you, is quelquechose [*sic*]” (Cerf to Canfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939).  \n\n*The Island Within* was discontinued after two and a half years because of poor sales.

When it first appeared, in 1924, critics everywhere acclaimed it as a brilliant novel which upheld the highest traditions of English fiction. In the intervening fifteen years, it has established itself with the general public as a twentieth-century classic. Its subtle characterizations, its deep understanding of the Eastern mind, and its serene spirit make it a story to be cherished by a world from which all tranquillity seems to have departed.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1949.  \n\nCerf tried to include *A Passage to India* in the ML shortly after he and Klopfer acquired the series (Cerf to Alfred Harcourt, 10 March 1926). Harcourt, Brace was agreeable but decided to ask Forster’s permission. Nine months later Harcourt reported, “The upshot of our correspondence with him is that we are forced to the decision not to sell this book to The Modern Library for next year” (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 11 December 1926). *A Passage to India* did not appear in the ML until thirteen years later.  \n\nShortly after the Second World War, Harcourt, Brace launched its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *A Passage to India* and eight other titles, including works by Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 3,300 copies of *A Passage to India* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948). *A Passage to India* sold 6,654 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Total ML sales were 48,110 copies (B. J. Kirkpatrick, *E. M.

They have emphasized the religious and literary qualities of the Book of books, and have made it easy to read and understand. The historical background of each book is traced in simple and succinct commentaries, and the very arrangement of the books themselves, in the probable order of their writing, throws new light on the development of religious thought. *The Short Bible* is a boon to those who seek its essential truth and beauty. (*Fall 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by University of Chicago Press, 1933. ML edition (pp. v–[549]) printed from University of Chicago Press plates. Published September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1969/70.  \n\n*The Short Bible* was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed to secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s *The Complete Bible: An American Translation* (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they wanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a \\$5,000 advance for *The Complete Bible* ($3,000 on signing and \\$2,000 one year after publication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think we could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to Donald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the University of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of *The Complete Bible* was premature, Cerf offered a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *The Short Bible* (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939). Shortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean to run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became Acting Manager of the Press.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting *The Complete Bible*. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with Goodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the complete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to the Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from California he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and Goodspeed had decided against a ML edition of *The Short Bible*. He reported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . . you and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up the Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until we can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant edition of the *Complete Bible*. I told him that we both understand full well that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but if we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to guarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of our contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December 1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).  \n\nLewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead with *The Short Bible*. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell well, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML rejected it, and that whichever firm got *The Short Bible* would have a “toe-hold” on *The Complete Bible*. He recommended that the ML secure *The Short Bible* on the understanding that it would get *The Complete Bible* if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and Klopfer’s concern that a ML edition of *The Short Bible* might injure their chances of getting *The Complete Bible* if it sold poorly but concluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23 February 1940).  \n\nCerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three days later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for *The Short Bible* was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After signing Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a reprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given the first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this edition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).  \n\nTwo years later Cerf offered a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights to *The Complete Bible*. Hemens replied that it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be different the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to Cerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that many readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have the complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really impressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). *The Complete Bible* never appeared in the ML.  \n\nThe text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted and abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago Press jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and appealing than that of the original edition.  \n\nThe ML edition of *The Short Bible* sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional printings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and printings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January 1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML titles.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \n*The Holy Bible*, illus.

In C. S. Forester’s happiest vein, this fabulous tale maintains from first page to last its breathless excitement. An asthmatic steam launch carries a timid Cockney and a maidenly English missionary on a river in Central Africa to the adventure of their lives. Romance triumphs over fate, tropical heat and whizzing bullets. *The African Queen* is a story to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime.

Published September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies.  \n\nCerf had never read *The African Queen*. He asked Little, Brown for a copy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about an hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that it was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years before the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.  \n\nForester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters omitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the foreword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in writing another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the end of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end without calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was called for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and it was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I really appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked of its last two [*sic*] chapters. . . . So it is with very great pleasure that I welcome this reissue of *The African Queen* for the opportunity it gives me of presenting the book in the form in which I first pictured it” (p. [*8*]).  \n\n### 333  \n\n**KATHERINE ANNE PORTER. FLOWERING JUDAS AND OTHER STORIES. 1940–1950; 1953–1970. (ML 88; ML 284)**  \n\n#### 333a.

In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was pleased that *Flowering Judas* was to be included in the series. She wrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I hope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a buyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library a God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have more.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly, a kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book; authors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little on the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8 May 1940).  \n\nThe ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier that year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book sells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of letting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).  \n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was terminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400 copies of *Flowering Judas* in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it would take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued in fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s *Light in August* (429), which was published in the series shortly after *Flowering Judas* was discontinued.  \n\nHarcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including *Flowering Judas* in Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring 1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and assigned *Flowering Judas* a new number (ML 284). Some copies of the 1946 ML printing that remained in the warehouse were sold in the spring 1953 jacket.  \n\n#### 333b.

No one could have thought so who had read HUMAN BEING. –*Christopher Morley*”); backstrip with same textured background as front panel with torchbearer and title in reverse; author, ML number, publisher, and frame around title in black. Designed by Paul Galdone, June 1940; unsigned.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Writing of *Human Being*, Edna Ferber said: “It is a glorious book, a wise and deeply understanding book. It has a touch of God in it, and the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, *Kitty Foyle*, as well as those who have yet to experience their first acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of *Human Being*. (*Fall 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights subsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp. [*5*–*7*], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a correction requested by Morley. Published October 1940. *WR* 12 October 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.  \n\nThe suggestion to include *Human Being* in the ML came from Morley himself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):  \n\n> Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little to see myself represented in there only by *Parnassus on Wheels*; a worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look at it now. \n> I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in *Human Being*, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person; a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.  \n\nCerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be represented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I don’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be added; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley backlist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern Library” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted that he had never read *Human Being* and asked Morley to send him a copy (Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he still thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general interest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think that a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was able to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf to Morley, 30 August 1939).  \n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing *Human Being* in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would prefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf agreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob [Haas] and I still think it is a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and the huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to Morley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition corrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.  \n\n*Human Being* sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that category. *Parnassus on Wheels* (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was the second worst-selling title.  \n\nThere was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By February 1944 sales of the ML edition of *Human Being* exceeded 6,000 copies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nMorley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (1931–1954) 213",
  "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1940",
  "year": "1940",
  "general": "By 1940, Cerf and Klopfer had been in charge of the ML for nearly fifteen years. Many titles inherited from Boni & Liveright were discontinued in the 1930s; by 1940, less than a third of the Boni & Liveright titles remained. ML Giants joined the regular ML series in 1931. By spring 1940, regular titles and Giants together numbered 270 titles—two-and-a-half times the size of the series when Cerf and Klopfer acquired it.  \n\nThe increased representation of American authors in the ML that began in the 1930s continued. By 1940, 28 percent of the authors in the regular series were Americans, compared to 20 percent in 1930. Even so, British authors remained in first place, accounting for 36 percent of the regular series. There was a marked falling off of French authors from 18 percent in 1930 to 11 percent in 1940. This decline reflected the large number of French titles—most of which were inherited from Boni & Liveright days—that were dropped during the 1930s.  \n\nBy 1940, the regular ML was a series of predominately modern works. In 1940, 22 percent of the titles were works dating from the preceding 20 years. In spring 1940, works first published between 1881 and 1900 made up just 15 percent of the regular ML series, compared with 34 percent in 1930 and 26 percent in 1925.  \n\nThe tendency toward making the ML more middlebrow was reflected in an increased proportion of fiction. By spring 1940, fiction accounted for 64 percent of the regular ML. That was the highest proportion of fiction the ML would ever contain.",
  "numberOfTitles": "Eleven new titles were added to the ML and nine were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular series to 219. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1940 ML Giants included fifty-two titles in fifty-four volumes.",
  "titlePage": "Beginning in 1940, ML title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. Existing titles acquired new title pages as they were reprinted. Blumenthal created the new title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer.",
  "binding": "The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s new format (7¼ x 4⅞ inches, enlarged from 6⅝ x 4⅜ inches) was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards and were sturdier than the ML’s earlier bindings. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination.  \n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold on all titles published 1940–1962.",
  "endpaper": "An enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s larger format, was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged; the surrounding pattern of open books and “ml” initials was extended to fill the larger space. The spring endpapers, like earlier Kent endpapers, were in moderate orange; fall 1940 endpapers were in gray. Kent endpapers in gray remained in use through spring 1966. New titles published in fall 1966 and spring 1967 had Kent endpapers in light yellowish brown. New endpapers designed by S. Neil Fujita were introduced in fall 1967 as part of a comprehensive redesign of the series.",
  "jackets": "All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Five titles (Sheean, *Personal History*; Marquand, *The Late George Apley*; Forester, *The African Queen*; Porter, *Flowering Judas and Other Stories*; and Emerson, *The Complete Essays and Other Writings*) had pictorial jackets. Six (Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida*; Machiavelli, *The Prince and The Discourses*; Lewisohn, *The Island Within*; Forster, *A Passage to India*; *The Short Bible*; and Morley, *Human Being*) had non-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Troilus and Cressida*, Machiavelli, Lewisohn, and Forster were clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many for older titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed.",
  "price": "95 cents.",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940), but it would be 1946 before *The Poems of Robert Frost* (393) appeared in the ML. Cerf tried again to get Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* for the ML, offering an advance of \\$2,000 against 10 cents a copy royalties for reprint rights (Cerf to Van Cartmell, Doubleday, Doran, 27 February 1940). It would be another decade before the ML secured reprint rights to Kipling’s novel. Cerf also sought Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings’s *The Yearling*, which was published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1938, became the year’s best-selling novel, and won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. He indicated that he wanted to publish it in 1942 (Cerf to Max Perkins, 11 April 1940). Scribner’s did not grant reprint rights to the ML until 1946. The ML edition of *The Yearling* (391) appeared late in 1946.  \n\nSeveral other titles to which Cerf tried to secure reprint rights never appeared in the series. He offered advances of \\$1,000 against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *The Collected Poems of T. S. Eliot* and Lytton Strachey’s *Queen Victoria* (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 26 April 1940; Cerf to Donald Brace, 3 May 1940). He had been trying to get *Queen Victoria* for the ML since 1928. He also wanted to publish William Graham Sumner’s *Folkways* as an ML Giant. He offered Ginn & Co., who first published it in 1906, a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. “Judging by our sales of similar volumes of the series,” he wrote, “I think it fair to assume that we will sell these 10,000 copies within a year and a half, and that thereafter the book should sell between 2000 and 4000 copies every year. . . .” (Cerf to Richard Thornton, Ginn & Co., 16 August 1940). Thornton declined the offer: “We still have a fair sale for the book, and we have recently put out a special Centennial Edition [Sumner was born in 1840], which we have been giving extra promotion” (Thornton to Cerf, 25 September 1940).  \n\nCerf received a suggestion for Alfred Thayer Mahan’s *Influence of Sea Power upon History*, but after seeing a copy he concluded it was “too special in its appeal—and dated, too—to be a likely candidate for ML” (Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 April 1940).",

McIntyre, Little, Brown, to Cerf, 29 September 1943). The ML edition sold 6,118 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles during this eighteen-month period. Sales to September 1943 totaled 13,450 copies (Cerf to Elizabeth Marden, Little, Brown, 24 September 1943).  \n\n#### 326b.

For students in our schools and colleges especially it provides a scholarly and readable version of what is considered by the most eminent authorities to be, with *The* *Canterbury Tales* (No. 161), Chaucer’s greatest achievement.

Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place.

When it first appeared, in 1924, critics everywhere acclaimed it as a brilliant novel which upheld the highest traditions of English fiction. In the intervening fifteen years, it has established itself with the general public as a twentieth-century classic.

Nine months later Harcourt reported, “The upshot of our correspondence with him is that we are forced to the decision not to sell this book to The Modern Library for next year” (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 11 December 1926). *A Passage to India* did not appear in the ML until thirteen years later.  \n\nShortly after the Second World War, Harcourt, Brace launched its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *A Passage to India* and eight other titles, including works by Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 3,300 copies of *A Passage to India* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948). *A Passage to India* sold 6,654 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.

They have emphasized the religious and literary qualities of the Book of books, and have made it easy to read and understand. The historical background of each book is traced in simple and succinct commentaries, and the very arrangement of the books themselves, in the probable order of their writing, throws new light on the development of religious thought. *The Short Bible* is a boon to those who seek its essential truth and beauty. (*Fall 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by University of Chicago Press, 1933. ML edition (pp. v–[549]) printed from University of Chicago Press plates. Published September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1969/70.  \n\n*The Short Bible* was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed to secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s *The Complete Bible: An American Translation* (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they wanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a \\$5,000 advance for *The Complete Bible* ($3,000 on signing and \\$2,000 one year after publication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think we could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to Donald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the University of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of *The Complete Bible* was premature, Cerf offered a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *The Short Bible* (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939). Shortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean to run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became Acting Manager of the Press.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting *The Complete Bible*. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with Goodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the complete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to the Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from California he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and Goodspeed had decided against a ML edition of *The Short Bible*. He reported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . . you and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up the Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until we can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant edition of the *Complete Bible*. I told him that we both understand full well that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but if we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to guarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of our contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December 1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).  \n\nLewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead with *The Short Bible*. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell well, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML rejected it, and that whichever firm got *The Short Bible* would have a “toe-hold” on *The Complete Bible*. He recommended that the ML secure *The Short Bible* on the understanding that it would get *The Complete Bible* if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and Klopfer’s concern that a ML edition of *The Short Bible* might injure their chances of getting *The Complete Bible* if it sold poorly but concluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23 February 1940).  \n\nCerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three days later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for *The Short Bible* was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After signing Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a reprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given the first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this edition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).  \n\nTwo years later Cerf offered a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights to *The Complete Bible*. Hemens replied that it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be different the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to Cerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that many readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have the complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really impressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). *The Complete Bible* never appeared in the ML.  \n\nThe text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted and abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago Press jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and appealing than that of the original edition.  \n\nThe ML edition of *The Short Bible* sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional printings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and printings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January 1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML titles.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \n*The Holy Bible*, illus.

An asthmatic steam launch carries a timid Cockney and a maidenly English missionary on a river in Central Africa to the adventure of their lives. Romance triumphs over fate, tropical heat and whizzing bullets. *The African Queen* is a story to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime. (*Fall 1940*) \n\n> Front flap reset with last sentence revised:  “*The African Queen* is a story of high adventure and suspense, to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime.” (*Fall 1959*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Little, Brown & Co., 1935, with the last four chapters of the British edition omitted. ML edition (pp. [1]–275) printed from Little, Brown plates with the last four chapters restored. Chapters 16–19 (pp. 276–[308]) printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies.  \n\nCerf had never read *The African Queen*. He asked Little, Brown for a copy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about an hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that it was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years before the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.  \n\nForester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters omitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the foreword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in writing another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the end of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end without calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was called for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and it was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I really appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked of its last two [*sic*] chapters. . . . So it is with very great pleasure that I welcome this reissue of *The African Queen* for the opportunity it gives me of presenting the book in the form in which I first pictured it” (p. [*8*]).  \n\n"

In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was pleased that *Flowering Judas* was to be included in the series. She wrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I hope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a buyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library a God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have more.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly, a kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book; authors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little on the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8 May 1940).  \n\nThe ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier that year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book sells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of letting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).  \n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was terminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400 copies of *Flowering Judas* in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it would take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued in fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s *Light in August* (429), which was published in the series shortly after *Flowering Judas* was discontinued.  \n\nHarcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including *Flowering Judas* in Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring 1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and assigned *Flowering Judas* a new number (ML 284). Some copies of the 1946 ML printing that remained in the warehouse were sold in the spring 1953 jacket.  \n\n#### 333b.

It has a touch of God in it, and the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, *Kitty Foyle*, as well as those who have yet to experience their first acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of *Human Being*. (*Fall 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights subsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp. [*5*–*7*], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a correction requested by Morley. Published October 1940. *WR* 12 October 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.  \n\nThe suggestion to include *Human Being* in the ML came from Morley himself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):  \n\n> Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little to see myself represented in there only by *Parnassus on Wheels*; a worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look at it now. \n> I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in *Human Being*, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person; a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.  \n\nCerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be represented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I don’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be added; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley backlist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern Library” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted that he had never read *Human Being* and asked Morley to send him a copy (Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he still thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general interest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think that a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was able to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf to Morley, 30 August 1939).  \n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing *Human Being* in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would prefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf agreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob [Haas] and I still think it is a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and the huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to Morley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition corrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.  \n\n*Human Being* sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that category. *Parnassus on Wheels* (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was the second worst-selling title.  \n\nThere was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By February 1944 sales of the ML edition of *Human Being* exceeded 6,000 copies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nMorley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (1931–1954) 213 "

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1940 1940 By 1940, Cerf and Klopfer had been in charge of the ML for nearly fifteen years. Many titles inherited from Boni & Liveright were discontinued in the 1930s; by 1940, less than a third of the Boni & Liveright titles remained. ML Giants joined the regular ML series in 1931. By spring 1940, regular titles and Giants together numbered 270 titles—two-and-a-half times the size of the series when Cerf and Klopfer acquired it.  \n\nThe increased representation of American authors in the ML that began in the 1930s continued. By 1940, 28 percent of the authors in the regular series were Americans, compared to 20 percent in 1930. Even so, British authors remained in first place, accounting for 36 percent of the regular series. There was a marked falling off of French authors from 18 percent in 1930 to 11 percent in 1940. This decline reflected the large number of French titles—most of which were inherited from Boni & Liveright days—that were dropped during the 1930s.  \n\nBy 1940, the regular ML was a series of predominately modern works. In 1940, 22 percent of the titles were works dating from the preceding 20 years. In spring 1940, works first published between 1881 and 1900 made up just 15 percent of the regular ML series, compared with 34 percent in 1930 and 26 percent in 1925.  \n\nThe tendency toward making the ML more middlebrow was reflected in an increased proportion of fiction. By spring 1940, fiction accounted for 64 percent of the regular ML. That was the highest proportion of fiction the ML would ever contain. Eleven new titles were added to the ML and nine were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular series to 219. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1940 ML Giants included fifty-two titles in fifty-four volumes. Beginning in 1940, ML title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. Existing titles acquired new title pages as they were reprinted. Blumenthal created the new title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s new format (7¼ x 4⅞ inches, enlarged from 6⅝ x 4⅜ inches) was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards and were sturdier than the ML’s earlier bindings. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination.  \n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold on all titles published 1940–1962. An enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s larger format, was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged; the surrounding pattern of open books and “ml” initials was extended to fill the larger space. The spring endpapers, like earlier Kent endpapers, were in moderate orange; fall 1940 endpapers were in gray. Kent endpapers in gray remained in use through spring 1966. New titles published in fall 1966 and spring 1967 had Kent endpapers in light yellowish brown. New endpapers designed by S. Neil Fujita were introduced in fall 1967 as part of a comprehensive redesign of the series. All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Five titles (Sheean, *Personal History*; Marquand, *The Late George Apley*; Forester, *The African Queen*; Porter, *Flowering Judas and Other Stories*; and Emerson, *The Complete Essays and Other Writings*) had pictorial jackets. Six (Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida*; Machiavelli, *The Prince and The Discourses*; Lewisohn, *The Island Within*; Forster, *A Passage to India*; *The Short Bible*; and Morley, *Human Being*) had non-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Troilus and Cressida*, Machiavelli, Lewisohn, and Forster were clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many for older titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed. 95 cents. (Spring) Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida* xEmerson, *Complete Essays*; Giants through G51; jackets: 271 (=spring 1941). (Fall) Emerson, *Complete Essays* xHugo, *Hunchback of Notre Dame*; Giants through G54; jackets: 274. Cerf expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940), but it would be 1946 before *The Poems of Robert Frost* (393) appeared in the ML. Cerf tried again to get Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* for the ML, offering an advance of \\$2,000 against 10 cents a copy royalties for reprint rights (Cerf to Van Cartmell, Doubleday, Doran, 27 February 1940). It would be another decade before the ML secured reprint rights to Kipling’s novel. Cerf also sought Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings’s *The Yearling*, which was published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1938, became the year’s best-selling novel, and won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. He indicated that he wanted to publish it in 1942 (Cerf to Max Perkins, 11 April 1940). Scribner’s did not grant reprint rights to the ML until 1946. The ML edition of *The Yearling* (391) appeared late in 1946.  \n\nSeveral other titles to which Cerf tried to secure reprint rights never appeared in the series. He offered advances of \\$1,000 against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *The Collected Poems of T. S. Eliot* and Lytton Strachey’s *Queen Victoria* (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 26 April 1940; Cerf to Donald Brace, 3 May 1940). He had been trying to get *Queen Victoria* for the ML since 1928. He also wanted to publish William Graham Sumner’s *Folkways* as an ML Giant. He offered Ginn & Co., who first published it in 1906, a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. “Judging by our sales of similar volumes of the series,” he wrote, “I think it fair to assume that we will sell these 10,000 copies within a year and a half, and that thereafter the book should sell between 2000 and 4000 copies every year. . . .” (Cerf to Richard Thornton, Ginn & Co., 16 August 1940). Thornton declined the offer: “We still have a fair sale for the book, and we have recently put out a special Centennial Edition [Sumner was born in 1840], which we have been giving extra promotion” (Thornton to Cerf, 25 September 1940).  \n\nCerf received a suggestion for Alfred Thayer Mahan’s *Influence of Sea Power upon History*, but after seeing a copy he concluded it was “too special in its appeal—and dated, too—to be a likely candidate for ML” (Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 April 1940).

Many titles inherited from Boni & Liveright were discontinued in the 1930s; by 1940, less than a third of the Boni & Liveright titles remained. ML Giants joined the regular ML series in 1931. By spring 1940, regular titles and Giants together numbered 270 titles—two-and-a-half times the size of the series when Cerf and Klopfer acquired it. [object Object]",
