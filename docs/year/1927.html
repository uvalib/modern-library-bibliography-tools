<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927</h1>
<h2>1927</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern Library, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence in America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell Kent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927). The letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was used. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement Number One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch Press (reproduced in Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, p. 66). The officers of the new venture were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers. Random House became the exclusive American distributor for books published by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel Press, the most important English private presses.</p>
<p>The first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited edition of Voltaire’s <em>Candide</em> with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It was printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in spring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of Random House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper and 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed by Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the Bauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed by the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.” Rockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of publication.</p>
<p>The market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock market crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing.</p>
<p>Two years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached Liveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former Boni &amp; Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in January 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni &amp; Liveright around the same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend Alfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927):</p>
<p>Since I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a price on the business, Bennett having offered me $250,000 and I believe that he could be gotten to pay $300,000. I wrestled with my soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19, Wallerstein family folder).</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles from the Boni &amp; Liveright period, bringing the total number of active titles to 139.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new ML titles except Lawrence, <em>The Rainbow</em> (138) were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>, and the last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown.</p>
<h3>Jacket</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with Bernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1 continued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Hudson, <em>Purple Land</em> xHardy, <em>Jude the Obscure</em>. (Fall) Hardy, <em>Jude the Obscure</em> xDumas, <em>Three Musketeers</em>.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint rights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930 and 1933—Ernest Hemingway, <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> (190)<em>;</em> John Dewey, <em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> (195); Joseph Conrad, <em>Victory</em> (238); Anatole France, <em>Penguin Island</em> (253); and Sinclair Lewis, <em>Arrowsmith</em> (254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s <em>How to Write Short Stories</em>. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to include <em>Round Up</em>, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the title <em>The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner</em> (344).</p>
<p>Cerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these were a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s <em>Crescent Moon</em>, Paul Leicester Ford’s <em>The Honorable Peter Stirling</em>, Lytton Strachey’s <em>Landmarks in French Literature</em>, Lord Charnwood’s <em>Abraham Lincoln</em>, O. Henry’s <em>The Trimmed Lamp</em>, and William McFee’s <em>Captain Macedoine’s Daughter</em>.</p>
<p>William Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles, including Henry James, <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> and <em>The American</em>; Santayana, <em>Soliloquies in England</em>; Turgenev, <em>A House</em> of <em>Gentlefolk</em>; Bunyan, <em>The Holy War</em>; Swift, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>; Mill, <em>On Liberty</em>; and Wells, <em>The Wheels of</em> <em>Chance</em> (Phelps to Cerf, 9 February 1927). Of these <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> (189) and <em>Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books</em> (212) were published in the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s <em>On Liberty</em> was included in <em>The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill</em> (G45) in 1939 and in <em>The Philosophy of John Stuart Mill</em> (537) in 1961.</p>
<p>The literary agency Brandt &amp; Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s <em>Manhattan Transfer</em>, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to justify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt &amp; Brandt, 26 May 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos: <em>Three Soldiers</em> (248) in 1932, <em>The 42nd Parallel</em> (307) in 1937, and <em>U.S.A.</em> (G42) in 1939. Brandt &amp; Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s <em>Selected Short Stories</em> (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that George was well enough represented in the ML by <em>A Bed of Roses</em> (Cerf to Brandt &amp; Brandt, 17 October 1927).</p>
<p>Klopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel <em>Where the Blue Begins</em>, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset &amp; Dunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of retail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML was sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major department stores.</p>
<p>Isador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone) offered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s <em>Maxims and Memoirs</em> for the ML (Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927).</p>
<h3>New titles</h3>
<p>Cabell, <em>Cream of the Jest</em> (1927) 131<br> Cellini, <em>Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</em> (1927) 132<br> Hawthorne, <em>Scarlet Letter</em> (1927) 133<br> Hudson, <em>Purple Land</em> (1927) 134<br> Nietzsche, <em>Ecce Homo &amp; The Birth of Tragedy</em> (1927) 135<br> Spinoza, <em>Philosophy</em> (1927) 136<br> Aiken, ed., <em>Modern American Poets</em> (1927‑1940), <em>Modern American Poetry</em> (1940–1945), <em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> (1945– ) 137<br> Lawrence, <em>The Rainbow</em> (1927) 138<br> Brown, <em>House with the Green Shutters</em> (1927) 139*<br> Hearn, <em>Some Chinese Ghosts</em> (1927) 140<br> Gourmont, <em>Virgin Heart</em> (1927) 141<br> Schreiner, <em>Story of an African Farm</em> (1927) 142<br> Bierce, <em>In the Midst of Life</em> (1927) 143<br> Meredith, <em>Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em> (1927) 144<br> Hardy, <em>Jude the Obscure</em> (1927) 145<br> Butler, <em>Erewhon</em> (1927) 146<br> Russell, <em>Selected Papers</em> (1927) 147<br> Saltus, <em>Imperial Orgy</em> (1927) 148<br> Renan, <em>Life of Jesus</em> (1927) 149<br></p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> “The Cream of the Jest is in ground plan an attempt to lay bare the secret soul of Felix Kennaston, a successful novelist—not the Bovaryan pseudo-soul visible to his wife and his neighbors, but that esoteric spirit which transcends time and space, and has its adventures in the superworld of the imagination. Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A thing obviously written <em>con amore</em> joyously without regard to markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —<em>H.</em> <em>L. Mencken</em>. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the allegory of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> we discover something of what is in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Robert M. McBride &amp; Co., 1917; new bibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with introduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions” (Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. [v]–250), including Ward’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride typesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML printings. Publication announced for January 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> as early as July 1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s <em>Jurgen</em> for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing a “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not want to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an edition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition never appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> the following year. <em>Jurgen</em> (271) was not included in the ML until 1934.</p>
<p>The first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title announced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of the eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print run. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state “<em>Eighth Printing</em> | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | <em>1927</em>”.) This might explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first ML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131 variant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s spring lists usually weren’t available as early as November.</p>
<p>In addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives (which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in August 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930, and printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937, for a total of at least 25,000 copies.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 33rd out of 147 ML titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> Thoroughly characteristic of its splendidly gifted and barbarically untameable author are these autobiographical memoirs—a production of the utmost energy, directness and racy animation, setting forth one of the most singular careers in all the annals of fine art. Cellini’s amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and fascinating books in existence.

<p><em>Jacket D:</em> Pictorial in moderate blue (182) and black on cream paper with inset illustration as jacket B; borders in moderate blue, lettering in black. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Of all the great personalities of the Renaissance, none more completely embodies the bold and sumptuous period than Benvenuto Cellini. His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble, is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the autobiographies of the world. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket E:</em> Pictorial in dark grayish blue (187), light gray (264), medium gray (265), black and gold on coated white paper with inset black-and-white illustration shaded in light and medium gray of a man and woman embracing with Florentine rooftops in background; title and translator in reverse against dark grayish blue background, decorations in gold.

<p>Front flap:<br> This remarkable biography, written between 1558 and 1562, reads like a picaresque novel. It is, in fact, one of the most important documents of the 16th century. Benvenuto Cellini, an audaciously self-serving Florentine goldsmith, tells of his escapades with the frankness and egoism characteristic of the Renaissance man, describing a life of unequaled grandeur, passion and adventure. It remains today one of the world masterpieces of autobiographical writing.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br> “I consider Hawthorne the most consummate literary artist in American literature, and ‘The Scarlet Letter’ the greatest book ever written in the Western Hemisphere. It holds its place among the fifteen best novels of the world.” — <em>William Lyon Phelps</em>
The inclusion of “The Scarlett Letter” in this series adds the name of Hawthorne to a roster of American authors that already contains Poe, Whitman, James, Melville, Dreiser, Anderson, Hearn, Crane, Bierce, O’Neill, Hecht and Beebe. As many more American works will be added as can be found to be consistent with the standards of the Modern Library. <em>(Spring 1927)</em></p>

<p>Front flap:<br> Of the few authors who have escaped the iconoclastic onslaughts of modern criticism, Nathaniel Hawthorne stands unassailed and with undiminished prestige among America’s immortals. Generations of readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of life, the story of Hester Phrynne [<em>sic</em>] has inevitably become part of our national legacy. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>When Cerf invited Phelps to write the introduction he indicated that <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> was being added to the series as part of “our endeavor to include . . . as many great American works as possible” and reminded the Yale professor that the ML had no introduction by him (Cerf to Phelps, 5 October 1926). Phelps missed the 15 November deadline by nearly a month and offered to waive the $50 fee (Phelps to Cerf, 12 December 1926), but Cerf sent it to him anyway.</p>

<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Stein offered Gerber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Gerber, 25 January 1950). He also sought Gerber’s advice about the text: “We are planning to reset the text of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> for the college edition and I want to check with you on the best text available. Our present text is that of the second edition, though I suspect that it occasionally backslides” (Stein to Gerber, 6 March 1950). Gerber recommended the text of the third or stereotyped edition published by Ticknor, Reed and Fields in 1850 (Gerber to Stein, 11 April 1950). Stein indicated that the text, including the “Preface to the Second Edition,” was being set from the stereotyped edition (Stein to Gerber, 17 April 1950).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br> Joseph Conrad wrote of W. H. Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of the sea at sunrise.
The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters, who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads, golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, <em>The Purple Land</em> retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. <em>The Purple Land</em> is a companion volume in the Modern Library to <em>Green Mansions</em> (No. 89.) (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets of the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American edition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore Roosevelt (Payne, p. 17).

<p>Cerf offered McFee $50 to write the introduction to <em>The</em> <em>Purple Land</em> and also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially <em>Captain Macedoine’s Daughter</em>, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> (223) was published in the ML in 1931.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Purple Land</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 67th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was at the bottom of the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales.</p>

Nietzsche’s other most important works may be obtained in Modern Library editions. “Thus Spake Zarathustra” is Volume Number 9, “Beyond Good and Evil” is Number 20, and “The Genealogy of Morals” is Number 62. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> <em>Ecce Homo</em> is a summary of Friedrich Nietzsche’s philosophy and his most robust affirmation of life. In these respects it is a spiritual and intellectual autobiography that proclaims with vigorous emphasis the virtues of strength and pride. The juxtaposition of <em>Ecce Homo</em> and <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> in one volume gains significance by opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML translation. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the four Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as <em>The Philosophy of Nietzsche</em> (G32).</p>
<p>After discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s <em>Dawn of Day</em> with Macmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted <em>Ecce Homo</em> instead. They hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England and offered an advance of $200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They asked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance that Macmillan would not put <em>Ecce Homo</em> into its series of inexpensive reprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent firm in London but the response was slow in coming.</p>
<p>After waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their own translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of Columbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended Horace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss indicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer than they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of his graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of <em>Ecce Homo</em> and <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> and to submit the manuscript by 6 December.</p>
<p>Approval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in mid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with Fadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October 1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but in time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition of <em>Ecce Homo &amp; The Birth of Tragedy</em> was the first time Fadiman’s name was attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, 22 May 1943, p. 37).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br> Mr. Ratner remarks that “after having been one of the liberating thinkers of mankind who was read but not honored, Spinoza is fast becoming one of the canonized of mankind who are honored but not read.” This volume with its Life, Introduction, and Selections will immensely assist to get Spinoza read and understood as well as honored. If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities; and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the extracts from Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> between selections from his more popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech, etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” —<span class="smallcaps">John Dewey</span>.

John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>

<p>Ratner was born in 1901 and received his M.A. from Columbia University in 1923. He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy department at Columbia when he compiled <em>The Philosophy of Spinoza</em>. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.</p>
<p>Cerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6 October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7 June 1927).</p>
<p>In April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York, Ratner sold his rights to <em>The Philosophy of Spinoza</em> and John Dewey’s <em>Intelligence in the Modern World</em> (G41) for $500. He also retained the unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700. The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner received no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the contracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus royalties accrued from 1 January 1940.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The vigor and diversity of contemporary American poetry is made strikingly manifest in this anthology. The selections by Conrad Aiken are distinguished for their good taste and the wide range of poetic gifts they reveal. Each of the poets in this volume is generously represented by from a few to a dozen or more poems, an unusual feature in an anthology and one which does greater justice to the whole range of the poet’s work than would the selection of the familiar, isolated poem. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged chronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by Aiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in Aiken’s preface. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for <em>Modern American Poets</em> and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to $700 for permissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He urged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the Secker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos Williams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March 1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single poem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of Williams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,” bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S. Eliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six.</p>
<p>Aiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that permissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the preface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have been unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr Ezra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously belong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence of Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to the ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of Mr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of these three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2) published in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by Sandburg but none by Masters.</p>
<p>Later in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s poems in the ML Giant, <em>An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry</em> (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging of Aiken’s <em>Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> (169.2).</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Published March 1945. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: 3,000 copies.</p>
<p>Aiken suggested revising and modernizing <em>Modern American Poets</em> in 1932 (Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until fall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that Aiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound, Archibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated that he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S. Eliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate Maxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also expressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems. However, when <em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> was in galley proofs Linscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except Eliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken eliminated all but two of his own poems.</p>
<p>Wartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles in print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML authors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote that fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod Lib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed serious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our lifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib doesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir? Will we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this year, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow” (Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of his ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be printed when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944).</p>
<p>The revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared early in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional printings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year, but Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the possibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the year, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your anthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count too heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many demands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary paper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945).</p>
<p><em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> was out of stock for about six months in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken $500 against 1947 royalties to help him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken, 6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in stock for the first time since the war” (<em>PW</em>, 18 September 1948, p. 1095).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> The variety and brilliance of contemporary American poetry are reflected in this new selection by Conrad Aiken. Eighty-one poets are presented, and of these, twenty-three now appear in an anthology for the first time. Mr. Aiken’s awareness of what is relevant, rather than what is merely “modish,” makes this anthology a critical as well as historical record of the growth and major tendencies of American poetry during the first half of this century.

</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published April 1963. <em>WR</em> 22 April 1963. First printing: 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>Aiken expressed interest in revising <em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> in 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8 February 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960. Epstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at least $4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised anthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a third. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new collection, and it would require new permissions fees for <em>all</em> the poems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from the 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material (Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962).</p>
<p>Aiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there was a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings totaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before 1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp. 109, 120).</p>

In all, eighty-one poets are presented, many of them for the first time in an anthology. The arrangement of this volume by Mr. Aiken, himself a much-honored poet, provides a critical as well as historical record of the major tendencies of American poetry during the first half of this century.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br> Ironically enough, it was the vain effort of a self-appointed censor to suppress “The Rainbow” that first called to the attention of the general public the enduring qualities of the book. It is one of those novels which England has produced that resembles its own immemorial oaks, with roots striking deep into the rich soil – the story of the Brangwens, whose menfolk, sturdy, lusty yeomen, might have had a place beside the knights and squires among the Canterbury Pilgrims. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The fierce ecstasy and sensual violence that pervade the novels of D. H. Lawrence reach their highest and most lyrical note in <em>The Rainbow</em>. The sturdy generations of Nottingham Brangwens of whom Lawrence writes are men and women of his own blood, possessed as he was by the hot, fecund urgency of the flesh, and made aware of all the dark and mystical labyrinths of physical love. <em>The Rainbow</em> ranks with the most distinguished works of fiction in our language dealing with sex, exalted and unashamed. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> Almost a quarter of a century has elapsed since this unique novel by George Brown gained, owing to the critical insight of Andrew Lang, rapid fame.
In what manner Brown might have developed, had he lived, and to what heights he might have attained, are beyond conjecture. His book reaches out to us with singular, doomed power. The terrible conclusion gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of the dawn!”
The editors of the Modern Library consider this novel one of the finest in the entire series. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co., 1901, with the author named as George Douglas. New bibliographical edition published by Thomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by A. &amp; C. Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp. [v], 1–314) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates. Publication announced for April 1927. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1931.</p>
<p>It is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published <em>The House with the Green Shutters</em> under the author’s full name rather than his better-known pseudonym George Douglas.</p>
<p>Seltzer described <em>The House with the Green Shutters</em> as follows: “. . . this famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern fiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young Scotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first book that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and moods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were equally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).</p>
<p>Broun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926) but failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in its place was originally written as an article for the British periodical <em>John O’London’s Weekly</em> (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never copyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at the last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the ML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the introduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its use. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter of protest to <em>Saturday Review of Literature</em> (“A Writer’s Grievance,” <em>SRL</em>, 10 September 1927, p. 110).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize <em>The House with the Green Shutters</em>, including distributing a portion of the first printing at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it failed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of 8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second printing of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it might catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br> Lafcadio Hearn was one of the very few white men who ever entered with real sympathy into the viewpoint of the East. As much as it was possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly authoritative note.
“In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”.

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> REMY DE GOURMONT’S somewhat cerebral passions have ample scope in the suave story of the courtship of a presumably innocent young girl by a sophisticated middle-aged man, incorporated in “A Virgin Heart.” Contrary to the accepted notion and to the ideas of the amorous M. Hervart, the modest, gentle, unassuming Rose is surprised at nothing, except the tepidity and reserve of her lover. Abstraction, insinuation and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s limpid and flexibly articulated prose.
Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product, almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont.

<p>Huxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New edition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its acquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by Greenberg. ML edition (pp. [5]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg plates. Published June 1927. <em>WR</em> 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933.</p>
<p>Edmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (<em>Axel’s Castle</em>, p. 22).</p>
<p>Huxley’s translation of <em>A Virgin Heart</em> appeared in the U.S. five years before Allen &amp; Unwin published it in Britain.</p>
<p>The ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated <em>A Virgin Heart</em>, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley declined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh his memory of <em>A Virgin Heart</em> and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to Cerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an introduction.</p>
<p>Greenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year after the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain, noting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our Modern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the spirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this title has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg, 21 October 1927).</p>
<p>There were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1928 and December 1931. After <em>A Virgin Heart</em> was discontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold, most of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June 1933).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br> Olive Schreiner finished “The Story of An African Farm” in 1879. Like many other good books, it was promptly rejected times without number, but was accepted finally by the London house of Chapman and Hall, on the advice of their reader, George Meredith.
The book was an immediate success. It is difficult to imagine that a work so singular in atmosphere, so potent in its passion, should ever have been anything else. To this day, it ranks as the great epic of a South Africa that has ceased to exist—a civilization that heard its sentence of death when gold was discovered on the Ridge of the White Waters.

<p>Front flap:<br> To George Meredith, then a publisher’s reader, belongs the credit for having saved from oblivion a manuscript that has become the spiritual expression of South Africa. Upon its publication in 1879, <em>The Story of an African Farm</em> won world-wide acclaim for its author as a writer of genius.

<p>Text on front:<br> “The question that starts to the lips of ninety-nine readers out of a hundred, even the best informed, will assuredly be: ‘Who is Ambrose Bierce?’ You may wander for years through literary circles and never meet anybody who has heard of him; and then you may hear some erudite student whisper in an awed voice: ‘Ambrose Bierce is the greatest modern prose writer!’” —Arnold Bennett
“Bierce was the first writer of fiction to treat war realistically. He antedated even Zola. . . . So far in this life, I have encountered no more thoroughgoing cynic than Bierce. Out of the spectacle of life about him he got an unflagging and Gargantuan joy”. —H. L. Mencken.
George Sterling, lifelong friend of Ambrose Bierce, wrote the introduction for this volume two weeks before his tragic death. It was the last writing from his pen. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> More and more the fame of Ambrose Bierce grows, not so much from his fantastic life and mysterious death, but from his haunting and unforgettable tales. His art is candidly inhuman, yet the clarity and perfection of his style and his dramatic fervor give these “terror tales” a secure place among the classic short stories of literature. The first two stories in this volume— “A Horseman in the Sky” and “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge”—are generally considered Bierce’s best. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Text on front:<br> RICHARD FEVEREL is the first, as it is doubtless the favorite, of the astonishing succession of novels which placed Meredith among the demigods of English literature. Its essential theme is the question of a boy’s education, and the abortive attempt of a proud and opinionated father, hide-bound by theory and precept, to bring up his son through a system which controls all his early circumstances and represses many of the natural and wholesome impulses of adolescence.
The Modern Library reprints RICHARD FEVEREL from the first edition of the book, retaining all the passages written in the full glow and vigor of his prime, that Meredith excised in some of the later editions of the book. (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>

Unanimously they agree that this study of adolescence is more than a penetrating psychological document; it is a vivid and absorbing dramatization of the conflict between two generations, made memorable by a glowing passion. After the first edition of <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>, several passages, essential to its full appreciation, were deleted. These have been entirely restored in the Modern Library version.

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> Thomas Hardy’s conviction that men and women “are but helpless puppets in the hands of mischievous fate” is carried to its most relentless conclusion in “Jude the Obscure”. Such a storm arose after its publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another novel.
“Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as one of his most unforgettable creations.
(Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (<em>Fall 1928</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave, pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels. By common consent, <em>Jude the Obscure</em> is his masterpiece. Since its publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex and instinct. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74), deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black of a town street with cottage at left, tree at right and church tower in background; lettering in black and in reverse, all (including wood engraving) against strong yellowish brown background and enclosed in triple-rule frame in deep reddish orange.

</blockquote>
<p>Printed from offset plates made from a new typesetting, following the text of the second edition (1903). Published November 1967.</p>
<p>Slack comments in the introduction about changes Hardy made between the 1895 first printing and the second edition in 1903. He states:</p>
<p>One scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903), Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in 1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br> <center> [1895] </center>
They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while, and faintly colouring.
She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they both turned, and regarded it.
‘You don’t think I threw it?’
‘O no.’
‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted it. He makes it into dubbin.’</p>
<center>. . . </center>
They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><br> <center> [1903] </center><br>
They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.
But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.
‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’
‘O no.’
‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown away.’</p>
<center>. . . </center>
They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge.

<p>Text on front:<br> “It is not wonderful that such a man as Butler should be the author of ‘Erewhon’, a shrewd and biting satire on modern life and thought—the best of its kind since ‘Gulliver’s Travels.’ . . . To lash the age, to ridicule vain pretension, to expose hypocrisy, to deride humbug in education, politics, and religion, are tasks beyond most men’s powers; but occasionally, very occasionally, a bit of genuine satire secures for itself more than a passing nod of recognition. ‘Erewhon,’ I think, is such a satire.” (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>

<p>Mumford received $50 for the introduction. When Cerf paid him he wrote, “You are the first author in the history of the Modern Library who delivered an introduction on time, and along with the enclosed check for $50 go our sincere and amazed thanks to you” (Cerf to Mumford, 5 April 1927).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> <em>Erewhon</em> and <em>Erewhon Revisited</em>, considered by many the most important works of their kind produced in the nineteenth century, won a place for their author as one of the great satirists of all time. Samuel Butler has been ranked in the glittering company of Voltaire and Swift, and, like his literary predecessors, he spared neither church nor state, literature or science from the attacks of his sharp wit and ironic commentaries. Underneath his irrepressible, malicious laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and stupidity. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Erewhon Revisited</em> originally published in London, 1901, and in U.S. by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1910. <em>Erewhon</em> and <em>Erewhon</em> <em>Revisited</em> first published together in Everyman’s Library, 1932. ML edition printed from existing 146a plates (<em>Erewhon</em>) together with plates made from a new typesetting (<em>Erewhon Revisited</em>). Published spring 1933. <em>WR</em> 15 April 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The addition of <em>Erewhon Revisited</em> was part of an effort in the early 1930s to make ML books a better value in the Depression book market. In 1932 the ML combined Maupassant’s <em>Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories</em> (8) and <em>Love and Other Stories</em> (72) into a single volume, <em>The Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant</em> (243). Wilde’s <em>Poems</em> (19) and <em>Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose</em> (58) were combined as <em>The Poems and Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde</em> (242). Wilde’s two volumes of plays, <em>Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan</em> (76) and <em>An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance</em> (77) were combined as <em>The Plays of Oscar Wilde</em> (241).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> Upon the completion of his <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, in collaboration with Dr. Whitehead, Bertrand Russell reached the conclusion that little could be achieved by writings addressed exclusively to specialists. Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness. These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

<p>Shortly after publication of <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> (119) Cerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to have declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife to the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed to select the contents and secure permissions from the original publishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond writing the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of the editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him, however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!” (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Komroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark to [<em>sic</em>] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured. The whole sceme [<em>sic</em>] was my idea in the first place and it would have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam [<em>sic</em>] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> Ernest Renan’s whole education formed a preparation for his task of chronicling the beginnings of Christianity; all his studies were subsidiary to the historical treatment of what, in his view, was the most significant cycle of events in history. <em>The Life of Jesus</em> was finally written in 1863 in Palestine, in the very midst of the scenes in which the tragic story it relates had taken place. The storm that broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends. John Haynes Holmes’ introduction appears exclusively in the Modern Library edition of this book. (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s <em>Life of Jesus</em> was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the beginnings of the Christian era. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was originally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>–<em>7</em>], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with Hutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. [<em>5</em>] reset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction. Published December 1927. <em>WR</em> 7 January 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Two other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. <em>The Life of Jesus</em> was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton, 1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation by the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd French edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations, was published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little, Brown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on economic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have required royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public domain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson translation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying royalties and the cost of resetting the text.</p>
<p>Klopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The Renan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore” (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library; published in Cerf and Klopfer, <em>Dear Donald, Dear Bennett</em>, p. 87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as “Renoir”). The bad plates continued to be used into the 1960s.</p>
<p>Holmes, minister of the Community Church in New York City, received $50 for the introduction.</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927 \n\n## 1927 \n\n### General \n\nCerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern Library, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence in America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell Kent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927). The letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was used. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement Number One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch Press (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new venture were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers. Random House became the exclusive American distributor for books published by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel Press, the most important English private presses. \n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited edition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It was printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in spring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of Random House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper and 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed by Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the Bauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed by the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.” Rockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of publication. \n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock market crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing. \n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached Liveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former Boni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in January 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around the same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend Alfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927): \n\nSince I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a price on the business, Bennett having offered me \\$250,000 and I believe that he could be gotten to pay \\$300,000. I wrestled with my soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19, Wallerstein family folder). \n\n### Number of titles \n\nCerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles from the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active titles to 139. \n\n### Format \n\nAll new ML titles except Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (138) were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate. \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). \n\n### Title page \n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, and the last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages. \n\n### Binding \n\nImitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover. \n\n### Endpaper \n\nBernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown. \n\n### Jacket \n\nAll new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with Bernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1 continued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles. \n\n### Price \n\n95 cents. \n\n### Dating keys \n\n(Spring) Hudson, *Purple Land* xHardy, *Jude the Obscure*. (Fall) Hardy, *Jude the Obscure* xDumas, *Three Musketeers*. \n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nThe original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint rights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930 and 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey, *Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238); Anatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How to Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to include *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the title *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344). \n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these were a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s *Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*, Lytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s *Abraham Lincoln*, O. Henry’s *The Trimmed Lamp*, and William McFee’s *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*. \n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles, including Henry James, *The Turn of the Screw* and *The American*; Santayana, *Soliloquies in England*; Turgenev, *A House* of *Gentlefolk*; Bunyan, *The Holy War*; Swift, *Gulliver’s Travels*; Mill, *On Liberty*; and Wells, *The Wheels of* *Chance* (Phelps to Cerf, 9 February 1927). Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published in the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The Philosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961. \n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to justify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26 May 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos: *Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and *U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s *Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that George was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf to Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927). \n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue Begins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of retail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML was sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major department stores. \n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone) offered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s *Maxims and Memoirs* for the ML (Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927). \n\n### New titles \n\nCabell, *Cream of the Jest* (1927) 131<br> Cellini, *Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini* (1927) 132<br> Hawthorne, *Scarlet Letter* (1927) 133<br> Hudson, *Purple Land* (1927) 134<br> Nietzsche, *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* (1927) 135<br> Spinoza, *Philosophy* (1927) 136<br> Aiken, ed., *Modern American Poets* (1927‑1940), *Modern American Poetry* (1940–1945), *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (1945– ) 137<br> Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (1927) 138<br> Brown, *House with the Green Shutters* (1927) 139\\*<br> Hearn, *Some Chinese Ghosts* (1927) 140<br> Gourmont, *Virgin Heart* (1927) 141<br> Schreiner, *Story of an African Farm* (1927) 142<br> Bierce, *In the Midst of Life* (1927) 143<br> Meredith, *Ordeal of Richard Feverel* (1927) 144<br> Hardy, *Jude the Obscure* (1927) 145<br> Butler, *Erewhon* (1927) 146<br> Russell, *Selected Papers* (1927) 147<br> Saltus, *Imperial Orgy* (1927) 148<br> Renan, *Life of Jesus* (1927) 149<br> \n\n\\*Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green Shutters* under the author’s full name George Douglas Brown rather than his better-known pseudonym George Douglas. \n\n### Discontinued\n\nAtherton, *Rezanov* (1917)<br> Davidson, *Poems* (1924)<br> MacBean, *Marjorie Fleming’s Book* (1921)<br> Ouida, *In a Winter City* (1923)<br> Sinclair, *The Belfry* (1918)<br> \n\n#### ***Spring*** \n\n### 131 \n\n**JAMES BRANCH CABELL.

Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A thing obviously written *con amore* joyously without regard to markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —*H.* *L. Mencken*. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the allegory of *The Cream of the Jest* we discover something of what is in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1917; new bibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with introduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions” (Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. [v]–250), including Ward’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride typesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML printings. Publication announced for January 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940. \n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Cream of the Jest* as early as July 1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s *Jurgen* for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing a “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not want to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an edition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition never appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* the following year. *Jurgen* (271) was not included in the ML until 1934. \n\nThe first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title announced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of the eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print run. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state “*Eighth Printing* | *First Modern Library Edition* | *1927*”.) This might explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first ML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131 variant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s spring lists usually weren’t available as early as November. \n\nIn addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives (which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in August 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930, and printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937, for a total of at least 25,000 copies. \n\nSales of *The Cream of the Jest* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 33rd out of 147 ML titles. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Cabell, *Beyond Life* (1923–1935) 104<br> Cabell, *Jurgen* (1934–1943) 271<br> \n\n### 132 \n\n**BENVENUTO CELLINI.

Cellini’s amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and fascinating books in existence.

His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble, is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the autobiographies of the world. (*Fall 1934*) \n\n*Jacket E:* Pictorial in dark grayish blue (187), light gray (264), medium gray (265), black and gold on coated white paper with inset black-and-white illustration shaded in light and medium gray of a man and woman embracing with Florentine rooftops in background; title and translator in reverse against dark grayish blue background, decorations in gold.

It was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943.

It is, in fact, one of the most important documents of the 16th century. Benvenuto Cellini, an audaciously self-serving Florentine goldsmith, tells of his escapades with the frankness and egoism characteristic of the Renaissance man, describing a life of unequaled grandeur, passion and adventure. It remains today one of the world masterpieces of autobiographical writing. \n\nPublished November 1985 at \\$9.95. ISBN 0-394-60528-4. \n\n### 133 \n\n**NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.

Generations of readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power of *The Scarlet Letter*. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of life, the story of Hester Phrynne [*sic*] has inevitably become part of our national legacy. (*Fall 1933*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.

Phelps missed the 15 November deadline by nearly a month and offered to waive the \\$50 fee (Phelps to Cerf, 12 December 1926), but Cerf sent it to him anyway. \n\nThe text of 133.1 is that of the second edition (Clark, p. 162). \n\n*The Scarlet Letter* did not rank among the 99 best-selling ML titles during the first six months of 1928.

Our present text is that of the second edition, though I suspect that it occasionally backslides” (Stein to Gerber, 6 March 1950). Gerber recommended the text of the third or stereotyped edition published by Ticknor, Reed and Fields in 1850 (Gerber to Stein, 11 April 1950). Stein indicated that the text, including the “Preface to the Second Edition,” was being set from the stereotyped edition (Stein to Gerber, 17 April 1950). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Hawthorne, *Complete Novels and Selected Tales* (Giant, 1937– ) G35 \n\n### 134 \n\n**W.

Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of the sea at sunrise. \n> The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters, who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads, golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, *The Purple Land* retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. *The Purple Land* is a companion volume in the Modern Library to *Green Mansions* (No. 89.) (*Spring 1934*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets of the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American edition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore Roosevelt (Payne, p. 17). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949. \n\nCerf offered McFee \\$50 to write the introduction to *The* *Purple Land* and also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s *Casuals of the Sea* (223) was published in the ML in 1931. \n\nSales of *The Purple Land* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 67th out of 147 ML titles.

In these respects it is a spiritual and intellectual autobiography that proclaims with vigorous emphasis the virtues of strength and pride. The juxtaposition of *Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* in one volume gains significance by opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (*Fall 1933*) \n\nOriginal ML translation. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the four Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as *The Philosophy of Nietzsche* (G32). \n\nAfter discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s *Dawn of Day* with Macmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted *Ecce Homo* instead. They hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England and offered an advance of \\$200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They asked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance that Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive reprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent firm in London but the response was slow in coming. \n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their own translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of Columbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended Horace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss indicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer than they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of his graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of *Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6 December. \n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in mid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with Fadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October 1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but in time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition of *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* was the first time Fadiman’s name was attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 22 May 1943, p. 37). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Nietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (1917–) 9<br> Nietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* (1917–1936) 28<br> Nietzsche, *Genealogy of Morals* (1918–1936) 59<br> Nietzsche, *Philosophy* (Giant, 1937–1970) G32<br> Nietzsche, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1968–) G113<br> \n\n### 136 \n\n**SPINOZA.

Several later printings of 136a are about ¼ inch taller and wider than the standard format. Narrow margins were sometimes unavoidable when the ML printed from other publishers’ plates, but it was unusual for a typesetting designed for the ML to have such narrow margins. It is possible that the size of the type page was determined by an economic decision to limit the volume to fourteen gatherings of sixteen leaves each. \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B. \n\n> Text on front:<br> Mr. Ratner remarks that “after having been one of the liberating thinkers of mankind who was read but not honored, Spinoza is fast becoming one of the canonized of mankind who are honored but not read.” This volume with its Life, Introduction, and Selections will immensely assist to get Spinoza read and understood as well as honored. If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities; and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the extracts from Spinoza’s *Ethics* between selections from his more popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech, etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” —<span class=\"smallcaps\">John Dewey</span>.

John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nRatner was born in 1901 and received his M.A. from Columbia University in 1923. He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy department at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930. \n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6 October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7 June 1927). \n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York, Ratner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s *Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for \\$500. He also retained the unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to \\$700. The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner received no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the contracts at any time within the next two years for \\$1,200 minus royalties accrued from 1 January 1940. \n\n#### 136b.

The selections by Conrad Aiken are distinguished for their good taste and the wide range of poetic gifts they reveal. Each of the poets in this volume is generously represented by from a few to a dozen or more poems, an unusual feature in an anthology and one which does greater justice to the whole range of the poet’s work than would the selection of the familiar, isolated poem. (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged chronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by Aiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in Aiken’s preface. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nCerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for *Modern American Poets* and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to \\$700 for permissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He urged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the Secker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos Williams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March 1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single poem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of Williams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,” bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S. Eliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six. \n\nAiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that permissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the preface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have been unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr Ezra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously belong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence of Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to the ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of Mr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of these three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2) published in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by Sandburg but none by Masters. \n\nLater in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s poems in the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging of Aiken’s *Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2). \n\n#### 137.1b.

First printing: 3,000 copies. \n\nAiken suggested revising and modernizing *Modern American Poets* in 1932 (Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until fall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that Aiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound, Archibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated that he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S. Eliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate Maxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also expressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems. However, when *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was in galley proofs Linscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except Eliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken eliminated all but two of his own poems. \n\nWartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles in print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML authors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote that fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod Lib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed serious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our lifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib doesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir? Will we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this year, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow” (Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of his ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be printed when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944). \n\nThe revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared early in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional printings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year, but Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the possibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the year, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your anthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count too heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many demands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary paper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945). \n\n*Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was out of stock for about six months in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken \\$500 against 1947 royalties to help him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken, 6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in stock for the first time since the war” (*PW*, 18 September 1948, p. 1095). \n\n#### 137.3a.

Eighty-one poets are presented, and of these, twenty-three now appear in an anthology for the first time. Mr. Aiken’s awareness of what is relevant, rather than what is merely “modish,” makes this anthology a critical as well as historical record of the growth and major tendencies of American poetry during the first half of this century. (*Spring 1963*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1963. *WR* 22 April 1963. First printing: 10,000 copies. \n\nAiken expressed interest in revising *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* in 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8 February 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960. Epstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at least \\$4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised anthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a third. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new collection, and it would require new permissions fees for *all* the poems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from the 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material (Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962). \n\nAiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there was a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings totaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before 1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp. 109, 120). \n\n#### 137.3b.

His book reaches out to us with singular, doomed power. The terrible conclusion gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of the dawn!” \n> The editors of the Modern Library consider this novel one of the finest in the entire series.

Publication announced for April 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1931. \n\nIt is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green Shutters* under the author’s full name rather than his better-known pseudonym George Douglas. \n\nSeltzer described *The House with the Green Shutters* as follows: “. . . this famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern fiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young Scotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first book that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and moods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were equally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926). \n\nBroun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926) but failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in its place was originally written as an article for the British periodical *John O’London’s Weekly* (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never copyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at the last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the ML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the introduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its use. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter of protest to *Saturday Review of Literature* (“A Writer’s Grievance,” *SRL*, 10 September 1927, p. 110). \n\nCerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize *The House with the Green Shutters*, including distributing a portion of the first printing at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it failed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of 8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second printing of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it might catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the end of the year. \n\n### 140 \n\n**LAFCADIO HEARN.

As much as it was possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly authoritative note. \n> “In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient.

(*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2. \n\n> Text on front:<br> REMY DE GOURMONT’S somewhat cerebral passions have ample scope in the suave story of the courtship of a presumably innocent young girl by a sophisticated middle-aged man, incorporated in “A Virgin Heart.” Contrary to the accepted notion and to the ideas of the amorous M. Hervart, the modest, gentle, unassuming Rose is surprised at nothing, except the tepidity and reserve of her lover. Abstraction, insinuation and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s limpid and flexibly articulated prose. \n> Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product, almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont. \n> (Remy de Gourmont’s “A Night in the Luxembourg” is volume Number 120 in the Modern Library) (Spring 1927) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*) \n\nHuxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New edition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its acquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by Greenberg. ML edition (pp. [5]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg plates. Published June 1927. *WR* 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933. \n\nEdmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (*Axel’s Castle*, p. 22). \n\nHuxley’s translation of *A Virgin Heart* appeared in the U.S. five years before Allen & Unwin published it in Britain. \n\nThe ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated *A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley declined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh his memory of *A Virgin Heart* and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to Cerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an introduction. \n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year after the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain, noting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our Modern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the spirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this title has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg, 21 October 1927). \n\nThere were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1928 and December 1931. After *A Virgin Heart* was discontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold, most of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June 1933). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Gourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926–1932) 125 \n\n### 142 \n\n**OLIVE SCHREINER.

Like many other good books, it was promptly rejected times without number, but was accepted finally by the London house of Chapman and Hall, on the advice of their reader, George Meredith. \n> The book was an immediate success. It is difficult to imagine that a work so singular in atmosphere, so potent in its passion, should ever have been anything else. To this day, it ranks as the great epic of a South Africa that has ceased to exist—a civilization that heard its sentence of death when gold was discovered on the Ridge of the White Waters.

Text on front: “The great epic of a South Africa that has ceased to exist.” (*Spring 1929*) \n\nFront flap:<br> To George Meredith, then a publisher’s reader, belongs the credit for having saved from oblivion a manuscript that has become the spiritual expression of South Africa. Upon its publication in 1879, *The Story of an African Farm* won world-wide acclaim for its author as a writer of genius. The burning passion that illuminates its pages gives conviction to a story unique in the annals of literature. Olive Schreiner was a child of the South Africa that has ceased to exist; her book is its crowning monument and memorial.

He antedated even Zola. . . . So far in this life, I have encountered no more thoroughgoing cynic than Bierce. Out of the spectacle of life about him he got an unflagging and Gargantuan joy”. —H. L.

Its essential theme is the question of a boy’s education, and the abortive attempt of a proud and opinionated father, hide-bound by theory and precept, to bring up his son through a system which controls all his early circumstances and represses many of the natural and wholesome impulses of adolescence. \n> The Modern Library reprints RICHARD FEVEREL from the first edition of the book, retaining all the passages written in the full glow and vigor of his prime, that Meredith excised in some of the later editions of the book.

Such a storm arose after its publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another novel. \n> “Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as one of his most unforgettable creations. \n> (Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (*Fall 1928*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D.

Since its publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex and instinct.

Signed: Galdone. \n\n> Front flap as jacket B. (*Spring 1938*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1895. ML edition (145.1, pp. [*5*–7], [*10*]–488) printed from a set of 1895 Harper plates with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September 1927. *WR* 5 November 1927. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1990. \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were six additional printings totaling 16,000 copies between 1928 and 1931; printings between 1932 and 1939 totaled 11,000 copies. The ML’s printers damaged the plate for p. 107 sometime between 1929 and 1932; the last three lines of that page are missing in one or more printings from that period. The plate was repaired after Klopfer pointed out the problem (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 13 April 1933; A. W. Rushmore, Harper & Bros., to Klopfer, 17 April 1933). \n\n#### 145.1b.

The Introduction is by Robert C. Slack of Carnegie-Mellon University. \n\nPrinted from offset plates made from a new typesetting, following the text of the second edition (1903). Published November 1967. \n\nSlack comments in the introduction about changes Hardy made between the 1895 first printing and the second edition in 1903. He states: \n\nOne scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903), Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in 1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference: \n> <br> <center> [1895] </center>\n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while, and faintly colouring. \n> She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they both turned, and regarded it. \n> ‘You don’t think I threw it?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted it. He makes it into dubbin.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge. \n\n> <br> <center> [1903] </center>  \n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him. \n> But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him. \n> ‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown away.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge. \n> In the revision Hardy has intentionally subdued the piece of pig’s flesh, and the scene of course is weakened. . . .

(*Spring 1933*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> *Erewhon* and *Erewhon Revisited*, considered by many the most important works of their kind produced in the nineteenth century, won a place for their author as one of the great satirists of all time. Samuel Butler has been ranked in the glittering company of Voltaire and Swift, and, like his literary predecessors, he spared neither church nor state, literature or science from the attacks of his sharp wit and ironic commentaries. Underneath his irrepressible, malicious laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and stupidity. (*Spring 1936*) \n\n*Erewhon Revisited* originally published in London, 1901, and in U.S. by E. P. Dutton & Co., 1910. *Erewhon* and *Erewhon* *Revisited* first published together in Everyman’s Library, 1932. ML edition printed from existing 146a plates (*Erewhon*) together with plates made from a new typesetting (*Erewhon Revisited*). Published spring 1933. *WR* 15 April 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nThe addition of *Erewhon Revisited* was part of an effort in the early 1930s to make ML books a better value in the Depression book market. In 1932 the ML combined Maupassant’s *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories* (8) and *Love and Other Stories* (72) into a single volume, *The Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* (243). Wilde’s *Poems* (19) and *Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose* (58) were combined as *The Poems and Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde* (242). Wilde’s two volumes of plays, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan* (76) and *An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance* (77) were combined as *The Plays of Oscar Wilde* (241). \n\n#### 146c.

(*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Upon the completion of his *Principia Mathematica*, in collaboration with Dr. Whitehead, Bertrand Russell reached the conclusion that little could be achieved by writings addressed exclusively to specialists. Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness. These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (*Spring 1936*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1927. *WR* 22 October 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nShortly after publication of *The Philosophy of William James* (119) Cerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to have declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife to the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed to select the contents and secure permissions from the original publishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond writing the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of the editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff: \n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him, however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!” (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926) \n\nKomroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He went on: \n\n> I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark to [*sic*] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured. The whole sceme [*sic*] was my idea in the first place and it would have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam [*sic*] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926). \n\n#### 147b.

The storm that broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends. John Haynes Holmes’ introduction appears exclusively in the Modern Library edition of this book. (*Fall 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s *Life of Jesus* was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the beginnings of the Christian era. (*Spring 1937*) \n\nThe ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was originally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML edition (pp. [*5*–*7*], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with Hutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. [*5*] reset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction. Published December 1927. *WR* 7 January 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. \n\nTwo other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. *The Life of Jesus* was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton, 1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation by the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd French edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations, was published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little, Brown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on economic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have required royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public domain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson translation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying royalties and the cost of resetting the text. \n\nKlopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The Renan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore” (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library; published in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p. 87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as “Renoir”). The bad plates continued to be used into the 1960s. \n\nHolmes, minister of the Community Church in New York City, received \\$50 for the introduction. \n\n#### 149b.

  "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927",
  "year": "1927",
  "general": "Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern Library, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence in America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell Kent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927). The letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was used. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement Number One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch Press (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new venture were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers. Random House became the exclusive American distributor for books published by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel Press, the most important English private presses. \n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited edition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It was printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in spring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of Random House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper and 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed by Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the Bauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed by the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.” Rockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of publication. \n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock market crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing. \n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached Liveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former Boni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in January 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around the same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend Alfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927): \n\nSince I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a price on the business, Bennett having offered me \\$250,000 and I believe that he could be gotten to pay \\$300,000. I wrestled with my soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19, Wallerstein family folder).",
  "numberOfTitles": "Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles from the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active titles to 139.",
  "format": "All new ML titles except Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (138) were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate. \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).",
  "titlePage": "All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, and the last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame.

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint rights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930 and 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey, *Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238); Anatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How to Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to include *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the title *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344). \n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these were a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s *Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*, Lytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s *Abraham Lincoln*, O. Henry’s *The Trimmed Lamp*, and William McFee’s *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*. \n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles, including Henry James, *The Turn of the Screw* and *The American*; Santayana, *Soliloquies in England*; Turgenev, *A House* of *Gentlefolk*; Bunyan, *The Holy War*; Swift, *Gulliver’s Travels*; Mill, *On Liberty*; and Wells, *The Wheels of* *Chance* (Phelps to Cerf, 9 February 1927). Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published in the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The Philosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961. \n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to justify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26 May 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos: *Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and *U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s *Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that George was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf to Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927). \n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue Begins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of retail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML was sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major department stores. \n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone) offered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s *Maxims and Memoirs* for the ML (Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927).",

Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A thing obviously written *con amore* joyously without regard to markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —*H.* *L. Mencken*. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the allegory of *The Cream of the Jest* we discover something of what is in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1917; new bibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with introduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions” (Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. [v]–250), including Ward’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride typesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML printings. Publication announced for January 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940. \n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Cream of the Jest* as early as July 1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s *Jurgen* for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing a “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not want to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an edition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition never appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* the following year. *Jurgen* (271) was not included in the ML until 1934. \n\nThe first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title announced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of the eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print run. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state “*Eighth Printing* | *First Modern Library Edition* | *1927*”.) This might explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first ML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131 variant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s spring lists usually weren’t available as early as November. \n\nIn addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives (which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in August 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930, and printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937, for a total of at least 25,000 copies. \n\nSales of *The Cream of the Jest* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 33rd out of 147 ML titles. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Cabell, *Beyond Life* (1923–1935) 104<br> Cabell, *Jurgen* (1934–1943) 271<br> \n\n"

His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble, is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades.

Generations of readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power of *The Scarlet Letter*. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of life, the story of Hester Phrynne [*sic*] has inevitably become part of our national legacy. (*Fall 1933*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.

Phelps missed the 15 November deadline by nearly a month and offered to waive the \\$50 fee (Phelps to Cerf, 12 December 1926), but Cerf sent it to him anyway. \n\nThe text of 133.1 is that of the second edition (Clark, p. 162). \n\n*The Scarlet Letter* did not rank among the 99 best-selling ML titles during the first six months of 1928.

Our present text is that of the second edition, though I suspect that it occasionally backslides” (Stein to Gerber, 6 March 1950). Gerber recommended the text of the third or stereotyped edition published by Ticknor, Reed and Fields in 1850 (Gerber to Stein, 11 April 1950).

Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of the sea at sunrise. \n> The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters, who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads, golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, *The Purple Land* retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. *The Purple Land* is a companion volume in the Modern Library to *Green Mansions* (No. 89.) (*Spring 1934*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets of the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American edition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore Roosevelt (Payne, p. 17). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949. \n\nCerf offered McFee \\$50 to write the introduction to *The* *Purple Land* and also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s *Casuals of the Sea* (223) was published in the ML in 1931. \n\nSales of *The Purple Land* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 67th out of 147 ML titles.

In these respects it is a spiritual and intellectual autobiography that proclaims with vigorous emphasis the virtues of strength and pride. The juxtaposition of *Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* in one volume gains significance by opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (*Fall 1933*) \n\nOriginal ML translation. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the four Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as *The Philosophy of Nietzsche* (G32). \n\nAfter discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s *Dawn of Day* with Macmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted *Ecce Homo* instead. They hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England and offered an advance of \\$200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They asked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance that Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive reprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent firm in London but the response was slow in coming. \n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their own translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of Columbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended Horace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss indicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer than they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of his graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of *Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6 December. \n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in mid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with Fadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October 1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but in time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition of *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* was the first time Fadiman’s name was attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 22 May 1943, p. 37). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Nietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (1917–) 9<br> Nietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* (1917–1936) 28<br> Nietzsche, *Genealogy of Morals* (1918–1936) 59<br> Nietzsche, *Philosophy* (Giant, 1937–1970) G32<br> Nietzsche, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1968–) G113<br> \n\n"

Several later printings of 136a are about ¼ inch taller and wider than the standard format. Narrow margins were sometimes unavoidable when the ML printed from other publishers’ plates, but it was unusual for a typesetting designed for the ML to have such narrow margins.

If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities; and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the extracts from Spinoza’s *Ethics* between selections from his more popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech, etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s thought for the present in an extraordinary way.

John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginal ML collection.

He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy department at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930. \n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6 October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7 June 1927). \n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York, Ratner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s *Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for \\$500. He also retained the unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to \\$700. The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner received no further royalties.

(*Spring 1929*) \n\n*Jacket C:* Non-pictorial in dark bluish green (165) and black on cream paper with title and decorations in reverse on inset dark bluish green panel; other lettering in black, borders in dark bluish green. Jacket title: *An Anthology of Modern American Poetry*. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The vigor and diversity of contemporary American poetry is made strikingly manifest in this anthology. The selections by Conrad Aiken are distinguished for their good taste and the wide range of poetic gifts they reveal. Each of the poets in this volume is generously represented by from a few to a dozen or more poems, an unusual feature in an anthology and one which does greater justice to the whole range of the poet’s work than would the selection of the familiar, isolated poem. (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged chronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by Aiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in Aiken’s preface. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nCerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for *Modern American Poets* and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to \\$700 for permissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He urged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the Secker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos Williams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March 1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single poem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of Williams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,” bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S. Eliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six. \n\nAiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that permissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the preface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have been unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr Ezra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously belong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence of Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to the ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of Mr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of these three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2) published in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by Sandburg but none by Masters. \n\nLater in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s poems in the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging of Aiken’s *Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2). \n\n#### 137.1b.

First printing: 3,000 copies. \n\nAiken suggested revising and modernizing *Modern American Poets* in 1932 (Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until fall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that Aiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound, Archibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated that he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S. Eliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate Maxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also expressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems. However, when *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was in galley proofs Linscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except Eliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken eliminated all but two of his own poems. \n\nWartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles in print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML authors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote that fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod Lib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed serious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our lifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib doesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir? Will we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this year, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow” (Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of his ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be printed when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944). \n\nThe revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared early in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional printings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year, but Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the possibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the year, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your anthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count too heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many demands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary paper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945). \n\n*Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was out of stock for about six months in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken \\$500 against 1947 royalties to help him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken, 6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in stock for the first time since the war” (*PW*, 18 September 1948, p. 1095). \n\n#### 137.3a.

Eighty-one poets are presented, and of these, twenty-three now appear in an anthology for the first time. Mr. Aiken’s awareness of what is relevant, rather than what is merely “modish,” makes this anthology a critical as well as historical record of the growth and major tendencies of American poetry during the first half of this century. (*Spring 1963*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1963. *WR* 22 April 1963. First printing: 10,000 copies. \n\nAiken expressed interest in revising *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* in 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8 February 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960. Epstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at least \\$4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised anthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a third. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new collection, and it would require new permissions fees for *all* the poems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from the 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material (Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962). \n\nAiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there was a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings totaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before 1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp. 109, 120). \n\n#### 137.3b.

His book reaches out to us with singular, doomed power. The terrible conclusion gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of the dawn!” \n> The editors of the Modern Library consider this novel one of the finest in the entire series.

Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926). \n\nBroun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926) but failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in its place was originally written as an article for the British periodical *John O’London’s Weekly* (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never copyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at the last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the ML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the introduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its use. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter of protest to *Saturday Review of Literature* (“A Writer’s Grievance,” *SRL*, 10 September 1927, p. 110). \n\nCerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize *The House with the Green Shutters*, including distributing a portion of the first printing at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it failed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of 8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second printing of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it might catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the end of the year. \n\n"

As much as it was possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly authoritative note. \n> “In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient.

(*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2. \n\n> Text on front:<br> REMY DE GOURMONT’S somewhat cerebral passions have ample scope in the suave story of the courtship of a presumably innocent young girl by a sophisticated middle-aged man, incorporated in “A Virgin Heart.” Contrary to the accepted notion and to the ideas of the amorous M. Hervart, the modest, gentle, unassuming Rose is surprised at nothing, except the tepidity and reserve of her lover. Abstraction, insinuation and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s limpid and flexibly articulated prose. \n> Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product, almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont. \n> (Remy de Gourmont’s “A Night in the Luxembourg” is volume Number 120 in the Modern Library) (Spring 1927) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*) \n\nHuxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New edition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its acquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by Greenberg. ML edition (pp. [5]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg plates. Published June 1927. *WR* 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933. \n\nEdmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (*Axel’s Castle*, p. 22). \n\nHuxley’s translation of *A Virgin Heart* appeared in the U.S. five years before Allen & Unwin published it in Britain. \n\nThe ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated *A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley declined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh his memory of *A Virgin Heart* and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to Cerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an introduction. \n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year after the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain, noting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our Modern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the spirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this title has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg, 21 October 1927). \n\nThere were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1928 and December 1931. After *A Virgin Heart* was discontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold, most of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June 1933). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Gourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926–1932) 125 \n\n"

It is difficult to imagine that a work so singular in atmosphere, so potent in its passion, should ever have been anything else.

Upon its publication in 1879, *The Story of an African Farm* won world-wide acclaim for its author as a writer of genius. The burning passion that illuminates its pages gives conviction to a story unique in the annals of literature. Olive Schreiner was a child of the South Africa that has ceased to exist; her book is its crowning monument and memorial.

Such a storm arose after its publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another novel. \n> “Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as one of his most unforgettable creations. \n> (Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (*Fall 1928*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave, pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels. By common consent, *Jude the Obscure* is his masterpiece. Since its publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex and instinct.

There were six additional printings totaling 16,000 copies between 1928 and 1931; printings between 1932 and 1939 totaled 11,000 copies. The ML’s printers damaged the plate for p. 107 sometime between 1929 and 1932; the last three lines of that page are missing in one or more printings from that period. The plate was repaired after Klopfer pointed out the problem (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 13 April 1933; A. W. Rushmore, Harper & Bros., to Klopfer, 17 April 1933). \n\n#### 145.1b.

The Introduction is by Robert C. Slack of Carnegie-Mellon University. \n\nPrinted from offset plates made from a new typesetting, following the text of the second edition (1903). Published November 1967. \n\nSlack comments in the introduction about changes Hardy made between the 1895 first printing and the second edition in 1903. He states: \n\nOne scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903), Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in 1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference: \n> <br> <center> [1895] </center>\n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while, and faintly colouring. \n> She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they both turned, and regarded it. \n> ‘You don’t think I threw it?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted it. He makes it into dubbin.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge. \n\n> <br> <center> [1903] </center>  \n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him. \n> But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him. \n> ‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown away.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge. \n> In the revision Hardy has intentionally subdued the piece of pig’s flesh, and the scene of course is weakened. . . .

(*Spring 1933*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> *Erewhon* and *Erewhon Revisited*, considered by many the most important works of their kind produced in the nineteenth century, won a place for their author as one of the great satirists of all time. Samuel Butler has been ranked in the glittering company of Voltaire and Swift, and, like his literary predecessors, he spared neither church nor state, literature or science from the attacks of his sharp wit and ironic commentaries. Underneath his irrepressible, malicious laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and stupidity. (*Spring 1936*) \n\n*Erewhon Revisited* originally published in London, 1901, and in U.S. by E. P. Dutton & Co., 1910. *Erewhon* and *Erewhon* *Revisited* first published together in Everyman’s Library, 1932.

In 1932 the ML combined Maupassant’s *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories* (8) and *Love and Other Stories* (72) into a single volume, *The Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* (243). Wilde’s *Poems* (19) and *Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose* (58) were combined as *The Poems and Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde* (242). Wilde’s two volumes of plays, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan* (76) and *An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance* (77) were combined as *The Plays of Oscar Wilde* (241). \n\n#### 146c.

Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness. These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (*Spring 1936*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1927. *WR* 22 October 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nShortly after publication of *The Philosophy of William James* (119) Cerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to have declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife to the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed to select the contents and secure permissions from the original publishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond writing the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of the editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff: \n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him, however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!” (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926) \n\nKomroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He went on: \n\n> I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark to [*sic*] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured. The whole sceme [*sic*] was my idea in the first place and it would have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam [*sic*] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926). \n\n#### 147b.

The storm that broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends. John Haynes Holmes’ introduction appears exclusively in the Modern Library edition of this book. (*Fall 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s *Life of Jesus* was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the beginnings of the Christian era. (*Spring 1937*) \n\nThe ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was originally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML edition (pp. [*5*–*7*], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with Hutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. [*5*] reset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction. Published December 1927. *WR* 7 January 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. \n\nTwo other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. *The Life of Jesus* was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton, 1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation by the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd French edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations, was published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little, Brown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on economic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have required royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public domain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson translation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying royalties and the cost of resetting the text. \n\nKlopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The Renan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore” (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library; published in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p. 87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as “Renoir”). The bad plates continued to be used into the 1960s. \n\nHolmes, minister of the Community Church in New York City, received \\$50 for the introduction. \n\n#### 149b.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927 1927 Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern Library, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence in America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell Kent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927). The letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was used. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement Number One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch Press (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new venture were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers. Random House became the exclusive American distributor for books published by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel Press, the most important English private presses. \n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited edition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It was printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in spring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of Random House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper and 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed by Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the Bauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed by the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.” Rockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of publication. \n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock market crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing. \n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached Liveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former Boni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in January 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around the same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend Alfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927): \n\nSince I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a price on the business, Bennett having offered me \\$250,000 and I believe that he could be gotten to pay \\$300,000. I wrestled with my soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19, Wallerstein family folder). Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles from the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active titles to 139. All new ML titles except Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (138) were published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). \n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate. \n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, and the last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover. Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown. All new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with Bernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1 continued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles. 95 cents. (Spring) Hudson, *Purple Land* xHardy, *Jude the Obscure*. (Fall) Hardy, *Jude the Obscure* xDumas, *Three Musketeers*. The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint rights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930 and 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey, *Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238); Anatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How to Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to include *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the title *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344). \n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these were a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s *Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*, Lytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s *Abraham Lincoln*, O. Henry’s *The Trimmed Lamp*, and William McFee’s *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*. \n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles, including Henry James, *The Turn of the Screw* and *The American*; Santayana, *Soliloquies in England*; Turgenev, *A House* of *Gentlefolk*; Bunyan, *The Holy War*; Swift, *Gulliver’s Travels*; Mill, *On Liberty*; and Wells, *The Wheels of* *Chance* (Phelps to Cerf, 9 February 1927). Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published in the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The Philosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961. \n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to justify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26 May 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos: *Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and *U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s *Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that George was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf to Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927). \n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue Begins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of retail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML was sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major department stores. \n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone) offered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s *Maxims and Memoirs* for the ML (Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927).
