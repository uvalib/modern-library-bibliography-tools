<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927</h1>
<h2>1927</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern
Library, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence
in America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell
Kent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927).
The letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was
used. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement
Number One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch
Press (reproduced in Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, p. 66). The officers of the new
venture were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers.
Random House became the exclusive American distributor for books
published by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel
Press, the most important English private presses.</p>
<p>The first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited
edition of Voltaire’s <em>Candide</em> with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It
was printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in
spring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of
Random House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper
and 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed
by Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the
Bauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed
by the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.”
Rockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of
publication.</p>
<p>The market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock
market crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing.</p>
<p>Two years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached
Liveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former
Boni &amp; Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in
January 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni &amp; Liveright around
the same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend
Alfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a
price on the business, Bennett having offered me $250,000 and I
believe that he could be gotten to pay $300,000. I wrestled with my
soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that
publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of
doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make
a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting
no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a
good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office
know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it
too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of
course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace
Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19,
Wallerstein family folder).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles
from the Boni &amp; Liveright period, bringing the total number of active
titles to 139.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new ML titles except Lawrence, <em>The Rainbow</em> (138) were published in
the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110
mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>, and the
last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a
double-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their
original ML, Inc. title pages.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in
gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown.</p>
<h3>Jacket</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with
Bernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1
continued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Hudson, <em>Purple Land</em> xHardy, <em>Jude the Obscure</em>. (Fall) Hardy,
<em>Jude the Obscure</em> xDumas, <em>Three Musketeers</em>.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint
rights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930
and 1933—Ernest Hemingway, <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> (190)<em>;</em> John Dewey,
<em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> (195); Joseph Conrad, <em>Victory</em> (238);
Anatole France, <em>Penguin Island</em> (253); and Sinclair Lewis, <em>Arrowsmith</em>
(254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s <em>How
to Write Short Stories</em>. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to
include <em>Round Up</em>, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the
title <em>The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner</em> (344).</p>
<p>Cerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these
were a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s
<em>Crescent Moon</em>, Paul Leicester Ford’s <em>The Honorable Peter Stirling</em>,
Lytton Strachey’s <em>Landmarks in French Literature</em>, Lord Charnwood’s
<em>Abraham Lincoln</em>, O. Henry’s <em>The Trimmed Lamp</em>, and William McFee’s
<em>Captain Macedoine’s Daughter</em>.</p>
<p>William Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles,
including Henry James, <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> and <em>The American</em>;
Santayana, <em>Soliloquies in England</em>; Turgenev, <em>A House</em> of
<em>Gentlefolk</em>; Bunyan, <em>The Holy War</em>; Swift, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>; Mill,
<em>On Liberty</em>; and Wells, <em>The Wheels of</em> <em>Chance</em> (Phelps to Cerf, 9
February 1927). Of these <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> (189) and <em>Gulliver’s
Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books</em> (212) were published
in the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s <em>On Liberty</em> was included in <em>The
English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill</em> (G45) in 1939 and in <em>The
Philosophy of John Stuart Mill</em> (537) in 1961.</p>
<p>The literary agency Brandt &amp; Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s
<em>Manhattan Transfer</em>, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to
justify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt &amp; Brandt, 26
May 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos:
<em>Three Soldiers</em> (248) in 1932, <em>The 42nd Parallel</em> (307) in 1937, and
<em>U.S.A.</em> (G42) in 1939. Brandt &amp; Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s
<em>Selected Short Stories</em> (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that
George was well enough represented in the ML by <em>A Bed of Roses</em> (Cerf
to Brandt &amp; Brandt, 17 October 1927).</p>
<p>Klopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel <em>Where the Blue
Begins</em>, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset &amp;
Dunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of
retail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML
was sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major
department stores.</p>
<p>Isador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone)
offered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s <em>Maxims and Memoirs</em> for the ML
(Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927).</p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“The Cream of the Jest is in ground plan an attempt to lay bare the
secret soul of Felix Kennaston, a successful novelist—not the Bovaryan
pseudo-soul visible to his wife and his neighbors, but that esoteric
spirit which transcends time and space, and has its adventures in the
superworld of the imagination. Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and
reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile
Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the
whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s
desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of
much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating
reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It
would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A
thing obviously written <em>con amore</em> joyously without regard to
markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth
attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere
time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —<em>H.</em> <em>L. Mencken</em>.
(<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s
mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the
illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane
philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the
enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix
Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the
allegory of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> we discover something of what is
in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Robert M. McBride &amp; Co., 1917; new
bibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with
introduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions”
(Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. [v]–250), including
Ward’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride
typesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML
printings. Publication announced for January 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927.
First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> as early as July
1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s
<em>Jurgen</em> for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing
a “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not
want to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an
edition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition
never appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of <em>The Cream of the
Jest</em> the following year. <em>Jurgen</em> (271) was not included in the ML
until 1934.</p>
<p>The first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title
announced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of
the eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print
run. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state
“<em>Eighth Printing</em> | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | <em>1927</em>”.) This
might explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first
ML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131
variant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s
spring lists usually weren’t available as early as November.</p>
<p>In addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives
(which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in
August 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930,
and printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937,
for a total of at least 25,000 copies.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> during the first six months of 1928
placed it 33rd out of 147 ML titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Thoroughly characteristic of its splendidly gifted and barbarically
untameable author are these autobiographical memoirs—a production of
the utmost energy, directness and racy animation, setting forth one of
the most singular careers in all the annals of fine art. Cellini’s
amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the
sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and
self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is
impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and
fascinating books in existence. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial without horizontal borders or rules in black on
pale blue (185) paper with inset illustration of a man with sword facing
a woman at left. Signed: Davidson. (<em>Spring 1929</em>) <em>Note:</em> Used on

with inset illustration as jacket B; borders in moderate blue, lettering
in black. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of all the great personalities of the Renaissance, none more
completely embodies the bold and sumptuous period than Benvenuto
Cellini. His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble,
is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for
almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a
life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate
creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its
untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the
autobiographies of the world. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket E:</em> Pictorial in dark grayish blue (187), light gray (264),
medium gray (265), black and gold on coated white paper with inset
black-and-white illustration shaded in light and medium gray of a man
and woman embracing with Florentine rooftops in background; title and
translator in reverse against dark grayish blue background, decorations
in gold. Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. Front flap as

best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of 1928. It
was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the
18-month period May 1942–October 1943. During the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it ranked toward the top of the second
quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. Sales totaled 126,884 copies by
spring 1958.</p>
<p><em>The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</em> was shifted from ML 3 to ML 150
in fall 1943 when the 3-volume Shakespeare was published as ML 1–3.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
This remarkable biography, written between 1558 and 1562, reads like a
picaresque novel. It is, in fact, one of the most important documents
of the 16th century. Benvenuto Cellini, an audaciously self-serving
Florentine goldsmith, tells of his escapades with the frankness and
egoism characteristic of the Renaissance man, describing a life of
unequaled grandeur, passion and adventure. It remains today one of the
world masterpieces of autobiographical writing.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
“I consider Hawthorne the most consummate literary artist in American
literature, and ‘The Scarlet Letter’ the greatest book ever written in
the Western Hemisphere. It holds its place among the fifteen best
novels of the world.” — <em>William Lyon Phelps</em></p>
<p>The inclusion of “The Scarlett Letter” in this series adds the name of
Hawthorne to a roster of American authors that already contains Poe,
Whitman, James, Melville, Dreiser, Anderson, Hearn, Crane, Bierce,
O’Neill, Hecht and Beebe. As many more American works will be added as
can be found to be consistent with the standards of the Modern
Library. <em>(Spring 1927)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the few authors who have escaped the iconoclastic onslaughts of
modern criticism, Nathaniel Hawthorne stands unassailed and with
undiminished prestige among America’s immortals. Generations of
readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power of <em>The
Scarlet Letter</em>. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude
toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction
and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of
life, the story of Hester Phrynne [<em>sic</em>] has inevitably become part
of our national legacy. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>When Cerf invited Phelps to write the introduction he indicated that
<em>The Scarlet Letter</em> was being added to the series as part of “our
endeavor to include . . . as many great American works as possible” and
reminded the Yale professor that the ML had no introduction by him (Cerf
to Phelps, 5 October 1926). Phelps missed the 15 November deadline by
nearly a month and offered to waive the $50 fee (Phelps to Cerf, 12
December 1926), but Cerf sent it to him anyway.</p>
<p>The text of 133.1 is that of the second edition (Clark, p. 162).</p>
<p><em>The Scarlet Letter</em> did not rank among the 99 best-selling ML titles
during the first six months of 1928. During the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales. It ranked high in the second quarter if ML titles by the 12-month

Stein offered Gerber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Gerber, 25
January 1950). He also sought Gerber’s advice about the text: “We are
planning to reset the text of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> for the college
edition and I want to check with you on the best text available. Our
present text is that of the second edition, though I suspect that it
occasionally backslides” (Stein to Gerber, 6 March 1950). Gerber
recommended the text of the third or stereotyped edition published by
Ticknor, Reed and Fields in 1850 (Gerber to Stein, 11 April 1950). Stein
indicated that the text, including the “Preface to the Second Edition,”
was being set from the stereotyped edition (Stein to Gerber, 17 April
1950).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
Joseph Conrad wrote of W. H. Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow
gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it
there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was
not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose
steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of
the sea at sunrise.</p>
<p>The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the
model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast
savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly
innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters,
who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads,
golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is
gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these
pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (<em>Spring
1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a
naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, <em>The Purple Land</em>
retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality
of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide
savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of
greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys
the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. <em>The
Purple Land</em> is a companion volume in the Modern Library to <em>Green
Mansions</em> (No. 89.) (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets
of the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American
edition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore
Roosevelt (Payne, p. 17). ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949.</p>
<p>Cerf offered McFee $50 to write the introduction to <em>The</em> <em>Purple Land</em>
and also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially
<em>Captain Macedoine’s Daughter</em>, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August
1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> (223)
was published in the ML in 1931.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Purple Land</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it
67th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October
1943 it was at the bottom of the third quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
“ECCE HOMO” is a fitting summary of Nietzsche’s character as a man and
his achievement as a thinker. “The Birth of Tragedy” is one of the
most difficult of his works to obtain in an adequate translation. Both
are presented here complete and unabridged.</p>
<p>Nietzsche’s other most important works may be obtained in Modern

62. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Ecce Homo</em> is a summary of Friedrich Nietzsche’s philosophy and his
most robust affirmation of life. In these respects it is a spiritual
and intellectual autobiography that proclaims with vigorous emphasis
the virtues of strength and pride. The juxtaposition of <em>Ecce Homo</em>
and <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> in one volume gains significance by
opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is
dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many
of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (<em>Fall
1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML translation. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the
four Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as <em>The
Philosophy of Nietzsche</em> (G32).</p>
<p>After discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s <em>Dawn of Day</em> with
Macmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted <em>Ecce Homo</em> instead.
They hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England
and offered an advance of $200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They
asked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance
that Macmillan would not put <em>Ecce Homo</em> into its series of inexpensive
reprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr.,
Macmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent
firm in London but the response was slow in coming.</p>
<p>After waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their
own translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of
Columbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended
Horace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss
indicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer
than they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of
his graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of
<em>Ecce Homo</em> and <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> and to submit the manuscript by 6
December.</p>
<p>Approval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in
mid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with
Fadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October
1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but
in time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition
of <em>Ecce Homo &amp; The Birth of Tragedy</em> was the first time Fadiman’s name
was attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, 22 May 1943, p.
37).</p>

<p><em>Format:</em> The first printing is in the standard 6½ by 4¼ inch format

136a are about ¼ inch taller and wider than the standard format. Narrow
margins were sometimes unavoidable when the ML printed from other
publishers’ plates, but it was unusual for a typesetting designed for
the ML to have such narrow margins. It is possible that the size of the

Mr. Ratner remarks that “after having been one of the liberating
thinkers of mankind who was read but not honored, Spinoza is fast
becoming one of the canonized of mankind who are honored but not
read.” This volume with its Life, Introduction, and Selections will
immensely assist to get Spinoza read and understood as well as
honored. If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I
should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding
the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities;
and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their
kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of
our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the
extracts from Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> between selections from his more
popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and
his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech,
etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s
thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be
disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence
in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling
him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the
light and leading which he can give.” —<span class="smallcaps">John

Professor Ratner’s masterly arrangement of Spinoza’s philosophy has
become the standard text in leading universities throughout the
country. John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s
volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the
professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious
companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can
give.” (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>

<p>Ratner was born in 1901 and received his M.A. from Columbia University
in 1923. He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy
department at Columbia when he compiled <em>The Philosophy of Spinoza</em>. He
received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.</p>
<p>Cerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on
Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on
Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract
on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I
believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the
excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6
October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza
continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7
June 1927).</p>
<p>In April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,
Ratner sold his rights to <em>The Philosophy of Spinoza</em> and John Dewey’s
<em>Intelligence in the Modern World</em> (G41) for $500. He also retained the
unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the
previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.
The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner
received no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the
contracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus
royalties accrued from 1 January 1940.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The vigor and diversity of contemporary American poetry is made
strikingly manifest in this anthology. The selections by Conrad Aiken
are distinguished for their good taste and the wide range of poetic
gifts they reveal. Each of the poets in this volume is generously
represented by from a few to a dozen or more poems, an unusual feature
in an anthology and one which does greater justice to the whole range
of the poet’s work than would the selection of the familiar, isolated
poem. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged
chronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by
Aiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in
Aiken’s preface. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for <em>Modern American
Poets</em> and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to $700 for
permissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He
urged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the
Secker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos
Williams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March
1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single
poem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of
Williams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions
consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,”
bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S.
Eliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy
Night,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six.</p>
<p>Aiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that
permissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the
preface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have
been unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr
Ezra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously
belong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence
of Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is
alone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I
may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to
the ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of
Mr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence
for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of
these three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but
disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2)
published in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by
Sandburg but none by Masters.</p>
<p>Later in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s
poems in the ML Giant, <em>An Anthology of Famous English and American
Poetry</em> (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging
of Aiken’s <em>Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> (169.2).</p>

“Their names constitute an honor roll of writers who have given to our

<p>Original ML anthology. Published March 1945. <em>WR</em> not found. First
printing: 3,000 copies.</p>
<p>Aiken suggested revising and modernizing <em>Modern American Poets</em> in 1932
(Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until
fall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that
Aiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound,
Archibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated
that he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S.
Eliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate
Maxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also
expressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems.
However, when <em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> was in galley proofs
Linscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except
Eliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken
eliminated all but two of his own poems.</p>
<p>Wartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles
in print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML
authors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote
that fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod
Lib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed
serious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our
lifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib
doesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir?
Will we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this
year, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow”
(Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of
his ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be
printed when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944).</p>
<p>The revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared
early in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional
printings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year,
but Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the
possibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the
year, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your
anthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count
too heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many
demands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary
paper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945).</p>
<p><em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> was out of stock for about six
months in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken $500 against 1947 royalties to
help him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken,
6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every
title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in
stock for the first time since the war” (<em>PW</em>, 18 September 1948, p.
1095).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The variety and brilliance of contemporary American poetry are
reflected in this new selection by Conrad Aiken. Eighty-one poets are
presented, and of these, twenty-three now appear in an anthology for
the first time. Mr. Aiken’s awareness of what is relevant, rather than
what is merely “modish,” makes this anthology a critical as well as
historical record of the growth and major tendencies of American
poetry during the first half of this century. (<em>Spring 1963</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published April 1963. <em>WR</em> 22 April 1963. First
printing: 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>Aiken expressed interest in revising <em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em>
in 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH
(Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8
February 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960.
Epstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at
least $4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised
anthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a
third. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new
collection, and it would require new permissions fees for <em>all</em> the
poems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from
the 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material
(Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962).</p>
<p>Aiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there
was a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings
totaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before
1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp.
109, 120).</p>

Frost, Eliot, Stevens, and Lowell, among others, are represented by
substantial selections, while Mr. Aiken opens a broader view of
American poetry through selections from a wide variety of lesser known
and newer poets.</p>
<p>In all, eighty-one poets are presented, many of them for the first
time in an anthology. The arrangement of this volume by Mr. Aiken,
himself a much-honored poet, provides a critical as well as historical
record of the major tendencies of American poetry during the first
half of this century.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
Ironically enough, it was the vain effort of a self-appointed censor
to suppress “The Rainbow” that first called to the attention of the
general public the enduring qualities of the book. It is one of those
novels which England has produced that resembles its own immemorial
oaks, with roots striking deep into the rich soil – the story of the
Brangwens, whose menfolk, sturdy, lusty yeomen, might have had a place
beside the knights and squires among the Canterbury Pilgrims. (<em>Spring
1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The fierce ecstasy and sensual violence that pervade the novels of
D. H. Lawrence reach their highest and most lyrical note in <em>The
Rainbow</em>. The sturdy generations of Nottingham Brangwens of whom
Lawrence writes are men and women of his own blood, possessed as he
was by the hot, fecund urgency of the flesh, and made aware of all the
dark and mystical labyrinths of physical love. <em>The Rainbow</em> ranks
with the most distinguished works of fiction in our language dealing
with sex, exalted and unashamed. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Almost a quarter of a century has elapsed since this unique novel by
George Brown gained, owing to the critical insight of Andrew Lang,
rapid fame.</p>
<p>In what manner Brown might have developed, had he lived, and to what
heights he might have attained, are beyond conjecture. His book
reaches out to us with singular, doomed power. The terrible conclusion
gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no
beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the
author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself
subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country
superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous
existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green
Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of
the dawn!”</p>
<p>The editors of the Modern Library consider this novel one of the
finest in the entire series. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>

<em>American Booksellers’ Convention, and their</em> | <em>guests, at the banquet

<p>Originally published in U.S. by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co., 1901, with the
author named as George Douglas. New bibliographical edition published by
Thomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by A. &amp; C. Boni, 1926. ML edition
(pp. [v], 1–314) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates. Publication
announced for April 1927. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000
copies. Discontinued 1 January 1931.</p>
<p>It is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published <em>The House with the Green
Shutters</em> under the author’s full name rather than his better-known
pseudonym George Douglas.</p>
<p>Seltzer described <em>The House with the Green Shutters</em> as follows: “. . .
this famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern
fiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young
Scotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first
book that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and
moods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were
equally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction
to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels
written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make
twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the
Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).</p>
<p>Broun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926)
but failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in
its place was originally written as an article for the British
periodical <em>John O’London’s Weekly</em> (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never
copyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at
the last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the
ML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the
introduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its
use. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter
of protest to <em>Saturday Review of Literature</em> (“A Writer’s Grievance,”
<em>SRL</em>, 10 September 1927, p. 110).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize <em>The House with
the Green Shutters</em>, including distributing a portion of the first
printing at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it
failed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of
8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second
printing of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it
might catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the
end of the year.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
Lafcadio Hearn was one of the very few white men who ever entered with
real sympathy into the viewpoint of the East. As much as it was
possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an
Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly
authoritative note.</p>
<p>“In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to
incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese
legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and
mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the
marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black
lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”.

Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy
with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of
Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the
reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and
pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes
plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his
spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
REMY DE GOURMONT’S somewhat cerebral passions have ample scope in the
suave story of the courtship of a presumably innocent young girl by a
sophisticated middle-aged man, incorporated in “A Virgin Heart.”
Contrary to the accepted notion and to the ideas of the amorous M.
Hervart, the modest, gentle, unassuming Rose is surprised at nothing,
except the tepidity and reserve of her lover. Abstraction, insinuation
and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s
limpid and flexibly articulated prose.</p>
<p>Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the
flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the
authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product,
almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered
almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont.</p>
<p>(Remy de Gourmont’s “A Night in the Luxembourg” is volume Number 120
in the Modern Library) (Spring 1927)</p>

<p>Huxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New
edition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its
acquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by
Greenberg. ML edition (pp. [5]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg
plates. Published June 1927. <em>WR</em> 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000
copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933.</p>
<p>Edmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical
champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (<em>Axel’s Castle</em>, p. 22).</p>
<p>Huxley’s translation of <em>A Virgin Heart</em> appeared in the U.S. five years
before Allen &amp; Unwin published it in Britain.</p>
<p>The ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000
copies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated
<em>A Virgin Heart</em>, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley
declined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh
his memory of <em>A Virgin Heart</em> and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to
Cerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an
introduction.</p>
<p>Greenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year
after the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain,
noting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our
Modern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the
spirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this
title has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg,
21 October 1927).</p>
<p>There were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between
November 1928 and December 1931. After <em>A Virgin Heart</em> was
discontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern
Library” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold,
most of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June
1933).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
Olive Schreiner finished “The Story of An African Farm” in 1879. Like
many other good books, it was promptly rejected times without number,
but was accepted finally by the London house of Chapman and Hall, on
the advice of their reader, George Meredith.</p>
<p>The book was an immediate success. It is difficult to imagine that a
work so singular in atmosphere, so potent in its passion, should ever
have been anything else. To this day, it ranks as the great epic of a
South Africa that has ceased to exist—a civilization that heard its
sentence of death when gold was discovered on the Ridge of the White
Waters. (<em>Spring</em> <em>1927</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
To George Meredith, then a publisher’s reader, belongs the credit for
having saved from oblivion a manuscript that has become the spiritual
expression of South Africa. Upon its publication in 1879, <em>The Story
of an African Farm</em> won world-wide acclaim for its author as a writer
of genius. The burning passion that illuminates its pages gives
conviction to a story unique in the annals of literature. Olive
Schreiner was a child of the South Africa that has ceased to exist;
her book is its crowning monument and memorial. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
“The question that starts to the lips of ninety-nine readers out of a
hundred, even the best informed, will assuredly be: ‘Who is Ambrose
Bierce?’ You may wander for years through literary circles and never
meet anybody who has heard of him; and then you may hear some erudite
student whisper in an awed voice: ‘Ambrose Bierce is the greatest
modern prose writer!’” —Arnold Bennett</p>
<p>“Bierce was the first writer of fiction to treat war realistically. He
antedated even Zola. . . . So far in this life, I have encountered no
more thoroughgoing cynic than Bierce. Out of the spectacle of life
about him he got an unflagging and Gargantuan joy”. —H. L. Mencken.</p>
<p>George Sterling, lifelong friend of Ambrose Bierce, wrote the
introduction for this volume two weeks before his tragic death. It was
the last writing from his pen. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
More and more the fame of Ambrose Bierce grows, not so much from his
fantastic life and mysterious death, but from his haunting and
unforgettable tales. His art is candidly inhuman, yet the clarity and
perfection of his style and his dramatic fervor give these “terror
tales” a secure place among the classic short stories of literature.
The first two stories in this volume— “A Horseman in the Sky” and “An
Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge”—are generally considered Bierce’s
best. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
RICHARD FEVEREL is the first, as it is doubtless the favorite, of the
astonishing succession of novels which placed Meredith among the
demigods of English literature. Its essential theme is the question of
a boy’s education, and the abortive attempt of a proud and opinionated
father, hide-bound by theory and precept, to bring up his son through
a system which controls all his early circumstances and represses many
of the natural and wholesome impulses of adolescence.</p>
<p>The Modern Library reprints RICHARD FEVEREL from the first edition of
the book, retaining all the passages written in the full glow and
vigor of his prime, that Meredith excised in some of the later
editions of the book. (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Enthusiasts for the novels of George Meredith stand firm in their
preference for <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>. Unanimously they agree
that this study of adolescence is more than a penetrating
psychological document; it is a vivid and absorbing dramatization of
the conflict between two generations, made memorable by a glowing
passion. After the first edition of <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>,
several passages, essential to its full appreciation, were deleted.
These have been entirely restored in the Modern Library version.

Devoted readers of the novels of George Meredith insist upon their
preference for <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>. Its appeal is ageless
because it is a tale of adolescence and young love overcoming the
prejudices and obstructions of an older generation; it is a
psychological study as well as an idyll of youth. Written a century
ago, this romantic story of thwarted and triumphant love still retains
the glow of the best of the novels of this genre of its period. After
the first edition of <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>, several

<p>Text on front:<br>
Thomas Hardy’s conviction that men and women “are but helpless puppets
in the hands of mischievous fate” is carried to its most relentless
conclusion in “Jude the Obscure”. Such a storm arose after its
publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another
novel.</p>
<p>“Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first
time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all
its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as
one of his most unforgettable creations.</p>

Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (<em>Fall
1928</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave,
pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but
suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and
inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels.
By common consent, <em>Jude the Obscure</em> is his masterpiece. Since its
publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and
is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of
fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex
and instinct. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

<p>Slack comments in the introduction about changes Hardy made between the
1895 first printing and the second edition in 1903. He states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant
branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest
slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903),
Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made
remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in
1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s
acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of
Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes
unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for
Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more
effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference:</p>

<p>They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with
the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while,
and faintly colouring.</p>
<p>She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though
ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the
rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they
both turned, and regarded it.</p>
<p>‘You don’t think I threw it?’</p>
<p>‘O no.’</p>
<p>‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted
it. He makes it into dubbin.’</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding
the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[1903]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her
missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously
stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.</p>
<p>But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards
and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till,
moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.</p>
<p>‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’</p>
<p>‘O no.’</p>
<p>‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown
away.’</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding
each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge.</p>
<p>In the revision Hardy has intentionally subdued the piece of pig’s
flesh, and the scene of course is weakened. . . . (Introduction, pp.
xxi–xxii).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
“It is not wonderful that such a man as Butler should be the author of
‘Erewhon’, a shrewd and biting satire on modern life and thought—the
best of its kind since ‘Gulliver’s Travels.’ . . . To lash the age, to
ridicule vain pretension, to expose hypocrisy, to deride humbug in
education, politics, and religion, are tasks beyond most men’s powers;
but occasionally, very occasionally, a bit of genuine satire secures
for itself more than a passing nod of recognition. ‘Erewhon,’ I think,
is such a satire.” (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>

<em>Erewhon</em> and <em>Erewhon Revisited</em>, considered by many the most
important works of their kind produced in the nineteenth century, won
a place for their author as one of the great satirists of all time.
Samuel Butler has been ranked in the glittering company of Voltaire
and Swift, and, like his literary predecessors, he spared neither
church nor state, literature or science from the attacks of his sharp
wit and ironic commentaries. Underneath his irrepressible, malicious
laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and
stupidity. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Erewhon Revisited</em> originally published in London, 1901, and in U.S. by
E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1910. <em>Erewhon</em> and <em>Erewhon</em> <em>Revisited</em> first
published together in Everyman’s Library, 1932. ML edition printed from
existing 146a plates (<em>Erewhon</em>) together with plates made from a new
typesetting (<em>Erewhon Revisited</em>). Published spring 1933. <em>WR</em> 15 April
1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The addition of <em>Erewhon Revisited</em> was part of an effort in the early
1930s to make ML books a better value in the Depression book market. In
1932 the ML combined Maupassant’s <em>Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other
Stories</em> (8) and <em>Love and Other Stories</em> (72) into a single volume,
<em>The Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant</em> (243). Wilde’s <em>Poems</em> (19) and
<em>Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose</em> (58) were combined as <em>The Poems and
Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde</em> (242). Wilde’s two volumes of plays,
<em>Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan</em> (76)
and <em>An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance</em> (77) were combined as
<em>The Plays of Oscar Wilde</em> (241).</p>

Worship” and “Mysticism and Logic”, printed in full; significant
chapters from “Education and the Good Life”; “Proposed Roads to

<p>Front flap:<br>
Upon the completion of his <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, in collaboration
with Dr. Whitehead, Bertrand Russell reached the conclusion that
little could be achieved by writings addressed exclusively to
specialists. Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of
life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness.
These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened
philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and
political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the
guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

<p>Shortly after publication of <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> (119)
Cerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to
Bertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to
have declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife
to the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed
to select the contents and secure permissions from the original
publishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond
writing the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of
the editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell
matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction
to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last
Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him,
however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what
selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much
better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!”
(Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Komroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He
went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark
to [<em>sic</em>] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured.
The whole sceme [<em>sic</em>] was my idea in the first place and it would
have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little
volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so
much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything
could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam
[<em>sic</em>] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list
I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Ernest Renan’s whole education formed a preparation for his task of
chronicling the beginnings of Christianity; all his studies were
subsidiary to the historical treatment of what, in his view, was the
most significant cycle of events in history. <em>The Life of Jesus</em> was
finally written in 1863 in Palestine, in the very midst of the scenes
in which the tragic story it relates had taken place. The storm that
broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and
to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their
outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was
qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly
comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends.
John Haynes Holmes’ introduction appears exclusively in the Modern
Library edition of this book. (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s <em>Life of Jesus</em>
was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and
literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation
created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its
most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete
accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry
with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the
beginnings of the Christian era. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was
originally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML
edition (pp. [<em>5</em>–<em>7</em>], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with
Hutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. [<em>5</em>]
reset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction.
Published December 1927. <em>WR</em> 7 January 1928. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Two other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. <em>The
Life of Jesus</em> was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton,
1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation
by the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd
French edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations,
was published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little,
Brown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on
economic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have
required royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public
domain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for
the ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson
translation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying
royalties and the cost of resetting the text.</p>
<p>Klopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The
Renan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore”
(Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University
Library; published in Cerf and Klopfer, <em>Dear Donald, Dear Bennett</em>, p.
87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as
“Renoir”). The bad plates continued to be used into the 1960s.</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927\n\n## 1927\n\n### General\n\nCerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern\nLibrary, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence\nin America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell\nKent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927).\nThe letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was\nused. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement\nNumber One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch\nPress (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new\nventure were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers.\nRandom House became the exclusive American distributor for books\npublished by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel\nPress, the most important English private presses.\n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited\nedition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It\nwas printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in\nspring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of\nRandom House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper\nand 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed\nby Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the\nBauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed\nby the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.”\nRockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of\npublication.\n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock\nmarket crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing.\n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached\nLiveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former\nBoni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in\nJanuary 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around\nthe same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend\nAlfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927):\n\n> Since I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a\n> price on the business, Bennett having offered me $250,000 and I\n> believe that he could be gotten to pay $300,000. I wrestled with my\n> soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that\n> publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of\n> doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make\n> a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting\n> no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a\n> good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office\n> know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it\n> too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of\n> course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace\n> Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19,\n> Wallerstein family folder).\n\n### Number of titles\n\nCerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles\nfrom the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active\ntitles to 139.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new ML titles except Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (138) were published in\nthe standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110\nmm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, and the\nlast line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a\ndouble-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their\noriginal ML, Inc. title pages.\n\n### Binding\n\nImitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in\ngold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nBernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown.\n\n### Jacket\n\nAll new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with\nBernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1\ncontinued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Hudson, *Purple Land* xHardy, *Jude the Obscure*. (Fall) Hardy,\n*Jude the Obscure* xDumas, *Three Musketeers*.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nThe original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint\nrights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930\nand 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey,\n*Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238);\nAnatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith*\n(254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How\nto Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to\ninclude *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the\ntitle *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344).\n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these\nwere a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s\n*Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*,\nLytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s\n*Abraham Lincoln*, O. Henry’s *The Trimmed Lamp*, and William McFee’s\n*Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*.\n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles,\nincluding Henry James, *The Turn of the Screw* and *The American*;\nSantayana, *Soliloquies in England*; Turgenev, *A House* of\n*Gentlefolk*; Bunyan, *The Holy War*; Swift, *Gulliver’s Travels*; Mill,\n*On Liberty*; and Wells, *The Wheels of* *Chance* (Phelps to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1927). Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s\nTravels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published\nin the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The\nEnglish Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The\nPhilosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961.\n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to\njustify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26\nMay 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos:\n*Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and\n*U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s\n*Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that\nGeorge was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf\nto Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927).\n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue\nBegins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of\nretail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML\nwas sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major\ndepartment stores.\n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone)\noffered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s *Maxims and Memoirs* for the ML\n(Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927).\n\n### New titles\n\nCabell, *Cream of the Jest* (1927) 131<br>\nCellini, *Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini* (1927) 132<br>\nHawthorne, *Scarlet Letter* (1927) 133<br>\nHudson, *Purple Land* (1927) 134<br>\nNietzsche, *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* (1927) 135<br>\nSpinoza, *Philosophy* (1927) 136<br>\nAiken, ed., *Modern American Poets* (1927‑1940), *Modern American\nPoetry* (1940–1945), *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (1945– ) 137<br>\nLawrence, *The Rainbow* (1927) 138<br>\nBrown, *House with the Green Shutters* (1927) 139\\*<br>\nHearn, *Some Chinese Ghosts* (1927) 140<br>\nGourmont, *Virgin Heart* (1927) 141<br>\nSchreiner, *Story of an African Farm* (1927) 142<br>\nBierce, *In the Midst of Life* (1927) 143<br>\nMeredith, *Ordeal of Richard Feverel* (1927) 144<br>\nHardy, *Jude the Obscure* (1927) 145<br>\nButler, *Erewhon* (1927) 146<br>\nRussell, *Selected Papers* (1927) 147<br>\nSaltus, *Imperial Orgy* (1927) 148<br>\nRenan, *Life of Jesus* (1927) 149<br>\n\n\\*Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green Shutters* under\nthe author’s full name George Douglas Brown rather than his better-known\npseudonym George Douglas.\n\n### Discontinued\n\nAtherton, *Rezanov* (1917)<br>\nDavidson, *Poems* (1924)<br>\nMacBean, *Marjorie Fleming’s Book* (1921)<br>\nOuida, *In a Winter City* (1923)<br>\nSinclair, *The Belfry* (1918)<br>\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 131\n\n**JAMES BRANCH CABELL.

But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the\n> whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s\n> desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of\n> much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating\n> reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It\n> would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A\n> thing obviously written *con amore* joyously without regard to\n> markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth\n> attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere\n> time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —*H.* *L. Mencken*.\n> (*Spring 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s\n> mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the\n> illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane\n> philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the\n> enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix\n> Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the\n> allegory of *The Cream of the Jest* we discover something of what is\n> in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1917; new\nbibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with\nintroduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions”\n(Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. \\[v\\]–250), including\nWard’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride\ntypesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML\nprintings. Publication announced for January 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927.\nFirst printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Cream of the Jest* as early as July\n1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s\n*Jurgen* for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing\na “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not\nwant to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an\nedition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition\nnever appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the\nJest* the following year. *Jurgen* (271) was not included in the ML\nuntil 1934.\n\nThe first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title\nannounced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of\nthe eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print\nrun. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state\n“*Eighth Printing* | *First Modern Library Edition* | *1927*”.) This\nmight explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first\nML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131\nvariant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s\nspring lists usually weren’t available as early as November.\n\nIn addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives\n(which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in\nAugust 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930,\nand printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937,\nfor a total of at least 25,000 copies.\n\nSales of *The Cream of the Jest* during the first six months of 1928\nplaced it 33rd out of 147 ML titles.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nCabell, *Beyond Life* (1923–1935) 104<br>\nCabell, *Jurgen* (1934–1943) 271<br>\n\n### 132\n\n**BENVENUTO CELLINI.

They\nasked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance\nthat Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive\nreprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr.,\nMacmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent\nfirm in London but the response was slow in coming.\n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their\nown translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of\nColumbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended\nHorace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss\nindicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer\nthan they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of\nhis graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of\n*Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6\nDecember.\n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in\nmid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with\nFadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October\n1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but\nin time for February publication.

He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy\ndepartment at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He\nreceived his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.\n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on\nRatner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on\nBiblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract\non Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I\nbelieve the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the\nexcessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6\nOctober 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza\ncontinues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7\nJune 1927).\n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,\nRatner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s\n*Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for $500. He also retained the\nunearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the\nprevious year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.\nThe two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner\nreceived no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the\ncontracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus\nroyalties accrued from 1 January 1940.\n\n#### 136b.

(*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged\nchronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by\nAiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in\nAiken’s preface. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nCerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for *Modern American\nPoets* and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to $700 for\npermissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He\nurged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the\nSecker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos\nWilliams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March\n1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single\npoem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of\nWilliams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions\nconsisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,”\nbringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S.\nEliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy\nNight,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six.\n\nAiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that\npermissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the\npreface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have\nbeen unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr\nEzra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously\nbelong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence\nof Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is\nalone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I\nmay put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to\nthe ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of\nMr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence\nfor which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of\nthese three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but\ndisappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2)\npublished in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by\nSandburg but none by Masters.\n\nLater in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s\npoems in the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American\nPoetry* (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging\nof Aiken’s *Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2).\n\n#### 137.1b.

They speak for a half\ncentury of growth in America.” (*Fall 1955*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published March 1945. *WR* not found. First\nprinting: 3,000 copies.\n\nAiken suggested revising and modernizing *Modern American Poets* in 1932\n(Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until\nfall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that\nAiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound,\nArchibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated\nthat he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S.\nEliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate\nMaxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also\nexpressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems.\nHowever, when *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was in galley proofs\nLinscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except\nEliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken\neliminated all but two of his own poems.\n\nWartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles\nin print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML\nauthors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote\nthat fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod\nLib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed\nserious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our\nlifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib\ndoesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir?\nWill we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this\nyear, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow”\n(Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of\nhis ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be\nprinted when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944).\n\nThe revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared\nearly in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional\nprintings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year,\nbut Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the\npossibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the\nyear, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your\nanthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count\ntoo heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many\ndemands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary\npaper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945).\n\n*Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was out of stock for about six\nmonths in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken $500 against 1947 royalties to\nhelp him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken,\n6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every\ntitle in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in\nstock for the first time since the war” (*PW*, 18 September 1948, p.\n1095).\n\n#### 137.3a.

(*Spring 1963*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1963. *WR* 22 April 1963. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies.\n\nAiken expressed interest in revising *Twentieth-Century American Poetry*\nin 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH\n(Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8\nFebruary 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960.\nEpstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at\nleast $4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised\nanthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a\nthird. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new\ncollection, and it would require new permissions fees for *all* the\npoems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from\nthe 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material\n(Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962).\n\nAiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there\nwas a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings\ntotaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before\n1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp.\n109, 120).\n\n#### 137.3b.

New bibliographical edition published by\nThomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by A. & C. Boni, 1926. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\], 1–314) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates. Publication\nannounced for April 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1931.\n\nIt is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green\nShutters* under the author’s full name rather than his better-known\npseudonym George Douglas.\n\nSeltzer described *The House with the Green Shutters* as follows: “. . .\nthis famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern\nfiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young\nScotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first\nbook that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and\nmoods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were\nequally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction\nto the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels\nwritten in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make\ntwenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the\nModern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).\n\nBroun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926)\nbut failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in\nits place was originally written as an article for the British\nperiodical *John O’London’s Weekly* (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never\ncopyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at\nthe last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the\nML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the\nintroduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its\nuse. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter\nof protest to *Saturday Review of Literature* (“A Writer’s Grievance,”\n*SRL*, 10 September 1927, p. 110).\n\nCerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize *The House with\nthe Green Shutters*, including distributing a portion of the first\nprinting at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it\nfailed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of\n8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second\nprinting of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it\nmight catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the\nend of the year.\n\n### 140\n\n***LAFCADIO HEARN.

Cerf asked Huxley, who translated\n*A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley\ndeclined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh\nhis memory of *A Virgin Heart* and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to\nCerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an\nintroduction.\n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year\nafter the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain,\nnoting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our\nModern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the\nspirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this\ntitle has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg,\n21 October 1927).\n\nThere were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between\nNovember 1928 and December 1931. After *A Virgin Heart* was\ndiscontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933).

He states:\n\n> One scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant\n> branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest\n> slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903),\n> Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made\n> remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in\n> 1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s\n> acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of\n> Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes\n> unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for\n> Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more\n> effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference:\n>\n> \\[1895\\]\n>\n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with\n> the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while,\n> and faintly colouring.\n>\n> She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though\n> ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the\n> rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they\n> both turned, and regarded it.\n>\n> ‘You don’t think I threw it?’\n>\n> ‘O no.’\n>\n> ‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted\n> it. He makes it into dubbin.’\n>\n> . . .\n>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding\n> the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge.\n\n\\[1903\\]\n\n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her\n> missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously\n> stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.\n>\n> But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards\n> and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till,\n> moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.\n>\n> ‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’\n>\n> ‘O no.’\n>\n> ‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown\n> away.’\n>\n> . . .\n>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding\n> each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge.\n>\n> In the revision Hardy has intentionally subdued the piece of pig’s\n> flesh, and the scene of course is weakened. . . .

Wilde’s *Poems* (19) and\n*Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose* (58) were combined as *The Poems and\nFairy Tales of Oscar Wilde* (242).

Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to\nBertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to\nhave declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife\nto the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed\nto select the contents and secure permissions from the original\npublishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond\nwriting the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of\nthe editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:\n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell\n> matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction\n> to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last\n> Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him,\n> however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what\n> selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much\n> better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!”\n> (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926)\n\nKomroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He\nwent on:\n\n> I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark\n> to \\[*sic*\\] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured.\n> The whole sceme \\[*sic*\\] was my idea in the first place and it would\n> have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little\n> volume of Russell’s Writings.

The storm that\n> broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and\n> to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil.

(*Fall 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s *Life of Jesus*\n> was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and\n> literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation\n> created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided.

(*Spring 1937*)\n\nThe ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was\noriginally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML\nedition (pp. \\[*5*–*7*\\], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with\nHutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. \\[*5*\\]\nreset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction.\nPublished December 1927. *WR* 7 January 1928. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nTwo other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. *The\nLife of Jesus* was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton,\n1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation\nby the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd\nFrench edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations,\nwas published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little,\nBrown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on\neconomic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have\nrequired royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public\ndomain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for\nthe ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson\ntranslation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying\nroyalties and the cost of resetting the text.\n\nKlopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The\nRenan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore”\n(Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University\nLibrary; published in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p.\n87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as\n“Renoir”).

  "general": "Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern\nLibrary, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence\nin America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell\nKent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927).\nThe letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was\nused. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement\nNumber One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch\nPress (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new\nventure were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers.\nRandom House became the exclusive American distributor for books\npublished by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel\nPress, the most important English private presses.\n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited\nedition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It\nwas printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in\nspring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of\nRandom House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper\nand 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed\nby Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the\nBauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed\nby the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.”\nRockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of\npublication.\n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock\nmarket crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing.\n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached\nLiveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former\nBoni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in\nJanuary 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around\nthe same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend\nAlfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927):\n\n> Since I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a\n> price on the business, Bennett having offered me $250,000 and I\n> believe that he could be gotten to pay $300,000. I wrestled with my\n> soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that\n> publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of\n> doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make\n> a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting\n> no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a\n> good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office\n> know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it\n> too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of\n> course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace\n> Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19,\n> Wallerstein family folder).",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint\nrights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930\nand 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey,\n*Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238);\nAnatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith*\n(254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How\nto Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to\ninclude *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the\ntitle *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344).\n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these\nwere a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s\n*Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*,\nLytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s\n*Abraham Lincoln*, O.

Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s\nTravels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published\nin the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The\nEnglish Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The\nPhilosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961.\n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to\njustify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26\nMay 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos:\n*Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and\n*U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s\n*Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that\nGeorge was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf\nto Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927).\n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue\nBegins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of\nretail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML\nwas sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major\ndepartment stores.\n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F.

(*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s\n> mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the\n> illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane\n> philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the\n> enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix\n> Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the\n> allegory of *The Cream of the Jest* we discover something of what is\n> in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1917; new\nbibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with\nintroduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions”\n(Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. \\[v\\]–250), including\nWard’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride\ntypesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML\nprintings. Publication announced for January 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927.\nFirst printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Cream of the Jest* as early as July\n1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s\n*Jurgen* for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing\na “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not\nwant to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an\nedition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition\nnever appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the\nJest* the following year. *Jurgen* (271) was not included in the ML\nuntil 1934.\n\nThe first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title\nannounced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of\nthe eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print\nrun. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state\n“*Eighth Printing* | *First Modern Library Edition* | *1927*”.) This\nmight explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first\nML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131\nvariant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s\nspring lists usually weren’t available as early as November.\n\nIn addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives\n(which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in\nAugust 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930,\nand printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937,\nfor a total of at least 25,000 copies.\n\nSales of *The Cream of the Jest* during the first six months of 1928\nplaced it 33rd out of 147 ML titles.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nCabell, *Beyond Life* (1923–1935) 104<br>\nCabell, *Jurgen* (1934–1943) 271<br>"

(*Spring 1929*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a\n> naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, *The Purple Land*\n> retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality\n> of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide\n> savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of\n> greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys\n> the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. *The\n> Purple Land* is a companion volume in the Modern Library to *Green\n> Mansions* (No. 89.) (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets\nof the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American\nedition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore\nRoosevelt (Payne, p. 17). ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949.\n\nCerf offered McFee $50 to write the introduction to *The* *Purple Land*\nand also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially\n*Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August\n1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s *Casuals of the Sea* (223)\nwas published in the ML in 1931.\n\nSales of *The Purple Land* during the first six months of 1928 placed it\n67th out of 147 ML titles.

Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the\nfour Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as *The\nPhilosophy of Nietzsche* (G32).\n\nAfter discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s *Dawn of Day* with\nMacmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted *Ecce Homo* instead.\nThey hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England\nand offered an advance of $200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They\nasked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance\nthat Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive\nreprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr.,\nMacmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent\nfirm in London but the response was slow in coming.\n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their\nown translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of\nColumbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended\nHorace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss\nindicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer\nthan they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of\nhis graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of\n*Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6\nDecember.\n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in\nmid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with\nFadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October\n1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but\nin time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition\nof *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* was the first time Fadiman’s name\nwas attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 22 May 1943, p.\n37).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (1917–) 9<br>\nNietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* (1917–1936) 28<br>\nNietzsche, *Genealogy of Morals* (1918–1936) 59<br>\nNietzsche, *Philosophy* (Giant, 1937–1970) G32<br>\nNietzsche, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1968–) G113<br>"

He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy\ndepartment at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He\nreceived his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.\n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on\nRatner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on\nBiblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract\non Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I\nbelieve the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the\nexcessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6\nOctober 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza\ncontinues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7\nJune 1927).\n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,\nRatner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s\n*Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for $500. He also retained the\nunearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the\nprevious year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.\nThe two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner\nreceived no further royalties.

(*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged\nchronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by\nAiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in\nAiken’s preface. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nCerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for *Modern American\nPoets* and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to $700 for\npermissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He\nurged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the\nSecker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos\nWilliams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March\n1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single\npoem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of\nWilliams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions\nconsisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,”\nbringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S.\nEliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy\nNight,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six.\n\nAiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that\npermissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the\npreface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have\nbeen unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr\nEzra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously\nbelong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence\nof Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is\nalone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I\nmay put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to\nthe ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of\nMr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence\nfor which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of\nthese three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but\ndisappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2)\npublished in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by\nSandburg but none by Masters.\n\nLater in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s\npoems in the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American\nPoetry* (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging\nof Aiken’s *Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2).\n\n#### 137.1b.

They speak for a half\ncentury of growth in America.” (*Fall 1955*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published March 1945. *WR* not found. First\nprinting: 3,000 copies.\n\nAiken suggested revising and modernizing *Modern American Poets* in 1932\n(Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until\nfall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that\nAiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound,\nArchibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated\nthat he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S.\nEliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate\nMaxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also\nexpressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems.\nHowever, when *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was in galley proofs\nLinscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except\nEliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken\neliminated all but two of his own poems.\n\nWartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles\nin print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML\nauthors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote\nthat fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod\nLib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed\nserious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our\nlifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib\ndoesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir?\nWill we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this\nyear, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow”\n(Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of\nhis ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be\nprinted when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944).\n\nThe revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared\nearly in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional\nprintings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year,\nbut Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the\npossibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the\nyear, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your\nanthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count\ntoo heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many\ndemands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary\npaper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945).\n\n*Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was out of stock for about six\nmonths in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken $500 against 1947 royalties to\nhelp him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken,\n6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every\ntitle in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in\nstock for the first time since the war” (*PW*, 18 September 1948, p.\n1095).\n\n#### 137.3a.

(*Spring 1963*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1963. *WR* 22 April 1963. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies.\n\nAiken expressed interest in revising *Twentieth-Century American Poetry*\nin 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH\n(Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8\nFebruary 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960.\nEpstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at\nleast $4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised\nanthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a\nthird. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new\ncollection, and it would require new permissions fees for *all* the\npoems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from\nthe 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material\n(Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962).\n\nAiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there\nwas a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings\ntotaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before\n1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp.\n109, 120).\n\n#### 137.3b.

New bibliographical edition published by\nThomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by A. & C. Boni, 1926. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\], 1–314) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates. Publication\nannounced for April 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1931.\n\nIt is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green\nShutters* under the author’s full name rather than his better-known\npseudonym George Douglas.\n\nSeltzer described *The House with the Green Shutters* as follows: “. . .\nthis famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern\nfiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young\nScotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first\nbook that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and\nmoods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were\nequally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction\nto the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels\nwritten in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make\ntwenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the\nModern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).\n\nBroun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926)\nbut failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in\nits place was originally written as an article for the British\nperiodical *John O’London’s Weekly* (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never\ncopyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at\nthe last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the\nML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the\nintroduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its\nuse. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter\nof protest to *Saturday Review of Literature* (“A Writer’s Grievance,”\n*SRL*, 10 September 1927, p. 110).\n\nCerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize *The House with\nthe Green Shutters*, including distributing a portion of the first\nprinting at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it\nfailed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of\n8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second\nprinting of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it\nmight catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the\nend of the year."

Cerf asked Huxley, who translated\n*A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition.

The ML edition was published without an\nintroduction.\n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year\nafter the ML edition was published.

Kallen appears to\nhave declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife\nto the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed\nto select the contents and secure permissions from the original\npublishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond\nwriting the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of\nthe editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:\n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell\n> matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction\n> to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last\n> Spring, his work would be entirely finished.

The unprecedented sensation\n> created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided.

First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nTwo other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. *The\nLife of Jesus* was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton,\n1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation\nby the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd\nFrench edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations,\nwas published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little,\nBrown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on\neconomic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have\nrequired royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public\ndomain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for\nthe ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson\ntranslation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying\nroyalties and the cost of resetting the text.\n\nKlopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . .

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927 1927 Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern\nLibrary, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence\nin America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell\nKent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927).\nThe letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was\nused. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement\nNumber One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch\nPress (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new\nventure were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers.\nRandom House became the exclusive American distributor for books\npublished by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel\nPress, the most important English private presses.\n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited\nedition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It\nwas printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in\nspring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of\nRandom House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper\nand 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed\nby Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the\nBauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed\nby the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.”\nRockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of\npublication.\n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock\nmarket crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing.\n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached\nLiveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former\nBoni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in\nJanuary 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around\nthe same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend\nAlfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927):\n\n> Since I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a\n> price on the business, Bennett having offered me $250,000 and I\n> believe that he could be gotten to pay $300,000. I wrestled with my\n> soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that\n> publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of\n> doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make\n> a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting\n> no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a\n> good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office\n> know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it\n> too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of\n> course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace\n> Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19,\n> Wallerstein family folder). Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles\nfrom the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active\ntitles to 139. All new ML titles except Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (138) were published in\nthe standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110\nmm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, and the\nlast line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a\ndouble-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their\noriginal ML, Inc. title pages. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in\ngold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover. Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown. All new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with\nBernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1\ncontinued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles. 95 cents. (Spring) Hudson, *Purple Land* xHardy, *Jude the Obscure*. (Fall) Hardy,\n*Jude the Obscure* xDumas, *Three Musketeers*. The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint\nrights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930\nand 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey,\n*Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238);\nAnatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith*\n(254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How\nto Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to\ninclude *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the\ntitle *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344).\n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these\nwere a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s\n*Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*,\nLytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s\n*Abraham Lincoln*, O. Henry’s *The Trimmed Lamp*, and William McFee’s\n*Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*.\n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles,\nincluding Henry James, *The Turn of the Screw* and *The American*;\nSantayana, *Soliloquies in England*; Turgenev, *A House* of\n*Gentlefolk*; Bunyan, *The Holy War*; Swift, *Gulliver’s Travels*; Mill,\n*On Liberty*; and Wells, *The Wheels of* *Chance* (Phelps to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1927). Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s\nTravels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published\nin the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The\nEnglish Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The\nPhilosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961.\n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to\njustify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26\nMay 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos:\n*Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and\n*U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s\n*Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that\nGeorge was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf\nto Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927).\n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue\nBegins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of\nretail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML\nwas sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major\ndepartment stores.\n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone)\noffered to translate La Rochefoucauld’s *Maxims and Memoirs* for the ML\n(Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927).
