<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1949</h1>
<h2>1949</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The postwar history of the Modern Library can be regarded as dating from
the beginning of 1949. That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two
major developments: the continuing expansion and consolidation of the
paperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that
increased the importance of the college market.</p>
<p>Cerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning. He
tried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in
paperback Pocket Book editions. When the ML had exclusive reprint rights
to copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing
them. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books
to publish two titles that deGraff wanted: Vincent Sheean’s <em>Personal
History</em>, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving
Stone’s <em>Lust for Life</em>, which had been in the ML for less than a year.</p>
<p>Often the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works.
The terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances
in which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset &amp; Dunlap
or other hardbound reprint edition. Even if the ML had exclusive reprint
rights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year
intervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release
paperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from
the ML when the contract expired.</p>
<p>Before the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback
editions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier
by the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously
affect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality
paperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library
Paperbacks.</p>
<p>Random House responded to growth in the college market for quality books
earlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950
under the direction of Jess Stein.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Eleven new titles were added to the ML and five were discontinued,
bringing the total number of titles in the regular series to 271.</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>Modern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph
Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created
the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making
electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format
was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth
linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray
cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark
blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a
given title was typically bound in a single-color combination. The inset
panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s
torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the
spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the
colored inner panel, within which Kent’s <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/K.webp'>torchbearer K</uvalib-modal-image-button>ent’s torchbearer
(facing left) was stamped in gold.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>$1.25.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Augustine, <em>Confessions</em> xByron, <em>Don Juan</em>; Giants through G73
with G22 <em>Thirty Famous One-Act Plays</em> and G9 Young, <em>The Medici</em>;
jackets: 341. (Fall) Byron, <em>Don Juan</em> xJames, <em>Washington Square</em>;
Giants through G73 with G9 DeQuincey, <em>Selected Writings</em>; jackets: 344.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Morton Dauwen Zabel, professor of English at the University of Chicago,
suggested a ML edition of Joseph Conrad’s <em>Under Western Eyes</em>. He
wrote, “I can think of no novel of Conrad’s outside of Lord Jim,
Victory, and Heart of Darkness (all of them already included in the
Modern Library) which more deserves to be known. The general neglect of
it, hitherto, is a shame” (Zabel to Jess Stein, 31 October 1949). Stein
forwarded the suggestion to Cerf, but the general consensus was that
there was insufficient demand to justify a ML edition.</p>

<p>*Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. withdrew <em>A Passage to India</em>, <em>Babbitt</em>, and
<em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> from the ML so they could be added to their own
hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, launched in 1948.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For its humor and its seriousness of purpose <em>A Connecticut Yankee in
King Arthur’s Court</em> is generally considered one of the highest
achievements among all of Mark Twain’s books. As satire, it deftly
strikes its blows at the follies of two ages, and as a passionate
expression for justice and freedom, it is a work which offers ever-new
rewards for the reflective reader. The second volume by Mark Twain to
be included in the series, <em>A Connecticut Yankee</em> takes an honored
place beside its predecessor, the Modern Library Giant <em>Tom Sawyer</em>
and <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> (G-49). (<em>Spring 1949</em>)</p>

<p>Cerf asked the director of sales and promotion at Harper’s if he thought
<em>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</em> would do well in the ML.
He also wanted to know how many other reprint editions were on the
market and whether Harper’s had plates in good condition that would fit
the ML’s format (Cerf to William H. Rose, 20 September 1948). The
reprint contract was dated 14 October 1948. The ML paid Harper’s
royalties of 5 cents a copy. The royalties were essentially a plate
rental since <em>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</em> was in the
public domain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a volume
that would include within 700 [±its more than 600] pages the
representative lyrical writings of the classic Roman poets. With this
book that need is now fulfilled. It includes the widest possible
variety of odes, satires, eclogues, elegies and epigrams that have
come down the centuries from such poets as Catullus, Lucretius,
Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, Seneca, Juvenal, Martial and others.
The translations by many skilled hands are the best obtainable, and
the Introduction by F. R. B. Godolphin brilliantly interprets the
poets and the verse of antiquity. (<em>Spring 1949; [Spring 1959]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published spring 1949. <em>WR</em> 29 January 1949.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Godolphin wanted to use Ezra Pound’s translations of seven elegies of
Propertius, but New Directions indicated that the permission fee would
be $250. Commins thought that the normal fee should be about $10 per
translation and declared, “I’ll be damned if we’ll pay anything like it”
(Commins to Godolphin, 18 November 1948). The Pound translations were
not used. Sales totaled 20,098 copies by spring 1958.</p>
<p>An internal Random House memo indicated in 1968 that <em>The Latin Poets</em>
could not be shifted to Vintage Books, the firm’s quality paperback
series, because permissions for use of copyrighted translations in the
anthology applied specifically to the ML edition. A decision was made at
that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity
as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November
1968).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
For almost sixteen centuries <em>The Confessions of Saint Augustine</em> has
stood unchallenged among autobiographies as the most moving and
profound outpouring of man’s soul to God. To Catholic readers it goes
to the heart of their faith and to more and more Protestants it has
become the book by which sectarian differences can be resolved. By
both it is acknowledged a literary masterpiece. Included in every list
of great books for students and general readers, <em>The Confessions</em>,
complete and unabridged in the E. B. Pusey translation and with a
stirring Introduction by Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, now takes a proud
and permanent place in the Modern Library series. (<em>Spring 1949</em>)</p>

<p>The Pusey translation, originally published in 1838, appears to have
been recommended by Sheen. The ML’s spring 1949 catalog announced <em>The
Confessions of Saint Augustine</em> in the J. G. Pilkington translation, but
Commins asked Sheen to indicate which of the two translations he
preferred (Commins to Sheen, 16 November 1948). Cerf believed that the
imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked
Sheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen
did not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would
affect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to
contact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949). The Church approved the
introduction but declined to give an imprimatur since Pusey was not a
Catholic and his translation had not been submitted to the censor.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Generally conceded to be Jane Austen’s best novels, <em>Pride and
Prejudice</em> and <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> are issued together in a single
volume on the insistence of an ever-growing number of enthusiasts for
the work of this chronicler of a more quiet time than our own. Without
rival as a recorder of the everyday trivia of provincial life in
England at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Jane Austen
remains even today the engrossing story-teller who brought drama and
truth and life to these great works of imagination. (<em>Spring 1949</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The three sensitively told short novels—“Noon Wine,” “Old Mortality,”
and the title story—are among the most clearly conceived and
exquisitely wrought brief narratives in American fiction. A writer of
few books, each one an ornament to English letters, Katherine Anne
Porter has achieved and maintained an illustrious position among her
contemporaries. <em>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</em> confirms and extends the
reputation earned by <em>Flowering Judas</em>. This second of her three
distinguished books, <em>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</em>, richly deserves a
permanent place in the Modern Library series. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>

<p><em>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</em> was the first Harcourt, Brace title added to
the ML after Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it was
terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for nine of its titles, including
Porter’s <em>Flowering Judas and Other Stories</em> (1940: 333) and works by
E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf, so
they could be included in its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern
Classics. Harcourt, Brace was reluctant at first to allow <em>Pale Horse,
Pale Rider</em> into the ML and offered Porter’s <em>The Leaning Tower</em>
instead. It then decided, perhaps as a peace offering, that the ML could
have the earlier work (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to Cerf, 3
December 1948).</p>
<p><em>Flowering Judas and Other Stories</em> never appeared in Harbrace Modern
Classics and was restored to the ML in 1953.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
To bring within the compass of one volume the best of the essays
written by Michel de Montaigne in a translation that is both faithful
and modern has long been the aim of the editors of this series. The
existing English renderings are either so archaic or are sometimes so
colloquial as to lose some of the original nuances of meaning.
Accordingly, with the William Hazlitt [Charles Cotton–W. C. Hazlitt]
translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of
Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and
modernized collection in language that retains the substance and
conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay
form. (<em>Fall 1949; [Spring 1956]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published
fall 1949. <em>WR</em> 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Montaigne’s <em>Essays</em> had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first
in the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford
University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation,
and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was
exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to
think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates
as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright
protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and
quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947).
He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern
Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged.
The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced
it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United
States. Because there was some question of British rights, we
voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search
of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only
available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four
volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and
comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29
September 1947).</p>
<p>Bates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century
translation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the
public domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or
readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the
Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at
least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The
contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely
to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you
deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the
original and to give the best possible modern rendering.”</p>
<p>Bates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt
translation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the
Editor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised
it, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to
the accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to
modernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the
translation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text
stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do
considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]). Bates did not
consider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement
“completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of
the title page be omitted.</p>
<p>The manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have
been delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his
editorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.</p>
<p>Bates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included
the essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion
of sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain
in language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one
of the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and
quotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed.
If you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to
Commins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in
fact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or,
if included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).</p>

<p>In 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern
Library College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a
list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently
cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not
include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the
near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College
Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year
as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be
incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to
Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.</p>
<p>Stein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously
bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML
consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s
translation of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,
Letters</em> (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably
the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3
November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.
If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition
of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Essays</em> in 1958, may
not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.</p>

Now, a century and a quarter after <em>Don Juan</em> was written, Lord
Byron’s glowing narrative poem continues to exercise an undiminished
appeal for readers of the widest variety of tastes. The young have
turned to it, generation after generation, for the fullest expression
of the romantic mood and gesture. This at once romantic and irreverent
tale is cherished by people of all ages for its excitement as story,
for its passion, its lyric felicity, its impudent satire and its
lively wit. <em>Don Juan</em>, the first of Byron’s works to be included in
the Modern Library series, is introduced, brilliantly and
perceptively, by Louis Kronenberger. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Based on the old Spanish saga familiar to us through Mozart and
Molière, <em>Don Juan</em> is Byron’s acknowledged masterpiece. A
sixteen-canto epic satire in ottava rima, it recounts the seductions
and betrayals, mishaps and adventures of the rakish Spanish grandee.
Byron’s “plan was to have no plan” but to “unpack his heart” in the
person of his hero. By his own account he meant to be “quietly
facetious about everything,” and he used the epic to satirize English
life, customs, manners and morals. But beneath the satiric impulse was
a hatred of hypocrisy and a consciousness of the power of illusion. If
<em>Childe Harold</em>, as Louis Kronenberger remarks in his introduction,
“is in large part Byronism, <em>Don Juan</em> “is Byron.” Romantic,
irreverent, exuberant and entertaining, it is a “hymn to the earth,”
but also a human sequence to “its own music chaunted.”</p>
<p>“There is something for us to learn from the courage and buoyancy with
which Byron came to terms with a world as shabby and confused as
ours.” —Dame Helen Gardner</p>

<p>Originally published as <em>Henry the Eighth</em> by Horace Liveright, 1929. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with
illustrations omitted. Published fall 1949. <em>WR</em> 10 December 1949. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The ML paid Liveright a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy. The Liveright plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML
had to reset the text and make new plates. The ML’s typesetting was made
from a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he
indicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March
1949). The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates
became the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against
royalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed
nothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties
were due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition
passed 30,000 copies. Hackett received $750 from Liveright when the ML
edition was published and nothing thereafter.</p>
<p>Arthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930
lived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American
publishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of
his own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the
$2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that
the ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random
House he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in
December 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies,
leaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20. The ML had paid nothing to
Liveright since the initial advance in 1949 (Hiram Haydn to Hackett, 22
December 1958).</p>

those books which include the basic writings of such philosophers as
Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Confucius, Laotse, Schopenhauer,
Pascal, William James, John Dewey, Friedrich Nietzsche, Bertrand
Russell, Bergson, Santayana and others. For this work, Professor Carl
Friedrich contributes a brilliant interpretive introduction to the
twelve essays in this volume, chosen to convey the essence of Kant’s
metaphysical thought. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>

Kant’s writings on the metaphysics of morality and politics. Here, a
series of lucid translations enables the reader to appreciate Kant’s
towering importance as an ethical and social thinker and to understand
his enduring influence on the shape of philosophy. The twelve essays
in this volume have been carefully arranged by Professor Carl J.
Friedrich to represent the range of Kant’s most essential writings.</p>
<p>Professor Friedrich has contributed an original essay for this volume
in the form of a brilliant interpretive Introduction which places
Kant, the philosopher and the man, in his time and timelessness.</p>
<p>A note about Kant’s special relevance today: “Indeed, the problem of
freedom, the freedom of the human personality to unfold and fulfill
its higher destiny, is the central issue of all of Kant’s
philosophizing” —from the Introduction. (<em>Spring 1967 format</em>)</p>

<p>ML original collection. Published December 1949. <em>WR</em> 21 January 1950.
First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Friedrich received a $750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy.
At first he planned to include selections from <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>
but wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly
as I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very
unsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure
Reason.” He suggested omitting <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> altogether and
including fuller extracts from the <em>Prolegomena</em> (Friedrich to Commins,
14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page
selection from the Introduction to <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> was
included. The ML published an abridged edition of <em>Critique of Pure
Reason</em> in 1958 (506).</p>
<p>Friedrich wrote Commins that he thought that <em>The Philosophy of Kant</em>
was a misleading title since large parts of the <em>Critique</em> were not
included. He suggested calling the book <em>Introduction to Kant</em> or
<em>Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy</em> (Friedrich to Commins,
20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had
already been announced. He argued that <em>The Philosophy of Kant</em> did not
misrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but
he offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to
Friedrich, 25 July 1949).</p>
<p>When he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest
editor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12
October 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).</p>
<p>Sales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950.</p>

“The tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains”
undertaken by Francis Parkman in 1846 became a journey of research and
brought forth, three years later, one of the permanent historical
records of American expansion. At first hand Parkman gathered from
Sioux Indians, hunters and trappers the material which was to make
<em>The Oregon Trail</em> as much a tale of adventure as an authentic
chronicle of the frontier. Exactly a century after its first
publication, it takes its place in the Modern Library series,
introduced by a distinguished contemporary historian, Henry Steele
Commager. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for fall 1949. <em>WR</em> 11 February 1950. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p><em>The Oregon Trail</em> was originally scheduled for publication in the
Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received $2,000
for the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page
drawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of
the chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were
to be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21
January 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before
escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated
Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both <em>The Oregon
Trail</em> and Alcott’s <em>Little Women</em>, the other Illustrated Modern Library
title announced for fall 1947.</p>
<p>At this point the type for <em>The Oregon Trail</em> was in galleys and the
plates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for
nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish <em>The
Oregon Trail</em> without illustrations in the regular ML. <em>Little Women</em>
(431) was added to the regular series the following year.</p>
<p>The jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss
made for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the
introduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote
him about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume
was at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29
June 1949).</p>

<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Fourteen Great Detective Stories</em>,
ed. Vincent Starrett (1928). Published December 1949. <em>WR</em> 14 January
1950. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Starrett declined the ML’s invitation to revise <em>Fourteen Great
Detective Stories</em> (1928: 155), citing lack of time, the “wildly
inadequate” fee offered, and his lack of sympathy with the hard-boiled
genre which he thought should be represented (Starrett to Maule, 28 July
1946). The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond
Chandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo
to Cerf, 23 September 1946).</p>
<p>Haycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight.
In his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in
detective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the
growth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely
imitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection
was available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has
excelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that
the hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and
distinct form” (p. xii).</p>

That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two\nmajor developments: the continuing expansion and consolidation of the\npaperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that\nincreased the importance of the college market.\n\nCerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning. He\ntried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in\npaperback Pocket Book editions. When the ML had exclusive reprint rights\nto copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing\nthem. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books\nto publish two titles that deGraff wanted: Vincent Sheean’s *Personal\nHistory*, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving\nStone’s *Lust for Life*, which had been in the ML for less than a year.\n\nOften the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works.\nThe terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances\nin which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset & Dunlap\nor other hardbound reprint edition. Even if the ML had exclusive reprint\nrights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year\nintervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release\npaperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from\nthe ML when the contract expired.\n\nBefore the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback\neditions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier\nby the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously\naffect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality\npaperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library\nPaperbacks.\n\nRandom House responded to growth in the college market for quality books\nearlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950\nunder the direction of Jess Stein.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nEleven new titles were added to the ML and five were discontinued,\nbringing the total number of titles in the regular series to 271.\n\n### Title page\n\nModern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer.\n\n### Binding\n\nThe binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark\nblue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a\ngiven title was typically bound in a single-color combination. The inset\npanels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer Kent’s torchbearer\n(facing left) was stamped in gold.\n\n### Price\n\n$1.25.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Augustine, *Confessions* xByron, *Don Juan*; Giants through G73\nwith G22 *Thirty Famous One-Act Plays* and G9 Young, *The Medici*;\njackets: 341.

He\nwrote, “I can think of no novel of Conrad’s outside of Lord Jim,\nVictory, and Heart of Darkness (all of them already included in the\nModern Library) which more deserves to be known. The general neglect of\nit, hitherto, is a shame” (Zabel to Jess Stein, 31 October 1949). Stein\nforwarded the suggestion to Cerf, but the general consensus was that\nthere was insufficient demand to justify a ML edition.\n\n### New titles\n\nTwain, *Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court* (1949) 414\n\nGodolphin, ed., *Latin Poets* (1949) 415\n\nAugustine, Saint, *Confessions* (1949) 416\n\nAusten, *Pride and Prejudice; Sense and Sensibility* (1949) 417\n\nPorter, Katherine Anne, *Pale Horse, Pale Rider* (1949) 418\n\nMontaigne, *Selected Essays* (1949) 419\n\nByron, *Don Juan* (1949) 420\n\nHackett, *Personal History of Henry the Eighth* (1949) 421\n\nKant, *Philosophy* (1949) 422\n\nParkman, *Oregon Trail* (1949) 423\n\nHaycraft, ed., *Fourteen Great Detective Stories* (1949) 424### Discontinued\n\nForster, *Passage to India* (1940)\\*\n\nHammett, *Maltese Falcon* (1934)\n\nHudson, *Purple Land* (1927)\n\nLewis, *Babbitt* (1942)\\*\n\nWoolf, *Mrs. Dalloway* (1928)\\*\n\n\\*Harcourt, Brace & Co. withdrew *A Passage to India*, *Babbitt*, and\n*Mrs. Dalloway* from the ML so they could be added to their own\nhardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, launched in 1948.\n\n***  \nSpring***\n\n### 414\n\n**MARK TWAIN.

Cerf believed that the\nimprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked\nSheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen\ndid not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would\naffect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to\ncontact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949).

Hazlitt\\]\n> translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of\n> Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and\n> modernized collection in language that retains the substance and\n> conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay\n> form. (*Fall 1949; \\[Spring 1956\\]*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published\nfall 1949. *WR* 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nMontaigne’s *Essays* had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first\nin the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford\nUniversity Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation,\nand the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was\nexhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to\nthink about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates\nas editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright\nprotection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and\nquite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947).\nHe then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern\nLibrary Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged.\nThe archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced\nit with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United\nStates. Because there was some question of British rights, we\nvoluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search\nof a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only\navailable ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four\nvolumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and\ncomparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29\nSeptember 1947).\n\nBates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century\ntranslation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the\npublic domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or\nreadability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the\nHazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at\nleast a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The\ncontract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely\nto Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you\ndeem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the\noriginal and to give the best possible modern rendering.”\n\nBates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt\ntranslation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the\nEditor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised\nit, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to\nthe accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to\nmodernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the\ntranslation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text\nstand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do\nconsiderable revising of the translation” (p. \\[vii\\]). Bates did not\nconsider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement\n“completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of\nthe title page be omitted.\n\nThe manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have\nbeen delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his\neditorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.\n\nBates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included\nthe essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion\nof sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain\nin language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one\nof the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and\nquotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed.\nIf you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to\nCommins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in\nfact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or,\nif included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).\n\n#### 419b.

(*Fall 1960*)\n\nIn 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern\nLibrary College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a\nlist of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently\ncut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not\ninclude the publication of this book in the College Editions within the\nnear future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College\nEditions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year\nas we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be\nincorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to\nBates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.\n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously\nbad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML\nconsider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s\ntranslation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,\nLetters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably\nthe definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3\nNovember 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.\nIf he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition\nof Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s *Complete Essays* in 1958, may\nnot have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Florio translation (1933–1945) G10.1\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Trechmann translation (1946–1948) G10.2\n\n### 420\n\n**LORD BYRON.

Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nThe ML paid Liveright a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy. The Liveright plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML\nhad to reset the text and make new plates. The ML’s typesetting was made\nfrom a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he\nindicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March\n1949). The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates\nbecame the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against\nroyalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed\nnothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties\nwere due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition\npassed 30,000 copies. Hackett received $750 from Liveright when the ML\nedition was published and nothing thereafter.\n\nArthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930\nlived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American\npublishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of\nhis own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the\n$2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that\nthe ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random\nHouse he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in\nDecember 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies,\nleaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20. The ML had paid nothing to\nLiveright since the initial advance in 1949 (Hiram Haydn to Hackett, 22\nDecember 1958).\n\n### 422\n\n**IMMANUEL KANT. THE PHILOSOPHY OF KANT. 1949– .

Published December 1949. *WR* 21 January 1950.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\nFriedrich received a $750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy.\nAt first he planned to include selections from *Critique of Pure Reason*\nbut wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly\nas I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very\nunsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure\nReason.” He suggested omitting *Critique of Pure Reason* altogether and\nincluding fuller extracts from the *Prolegomena* (Friedrich to Commins,\n14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page\nselection from the Introduction to *Critique of Pure Reason* was\nincluded. The ML published an abridged edition of *Critique of Pure\nReason* in 1958 (506).\n\nFriedrich wrote Commins that he thought that *The Philosophy of Kant*\nwas a misleading title since large parts of the *Critique* were not\nincluded. He suggested calling the book *Introduction to Kant* or\n*Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy* (Friedrich to Commins,\n20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had\nalready been announced. He argued that *The Philosophy of Kant* did not\nmisrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but\nhe offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to\nFriedrich, 25 July 1949).\n\nWhen he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest\neditor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12\nOctober 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).\n\nSales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950.\n\n#### 422b.

(*Fall 1949*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for fall 1949. *WR* 11 February 1950. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\n*The Oregon Trail* was originally scheduled for publication in the\nIllustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received $2,000\nfor the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page\ndrawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of\nthe chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were\nto be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21\nJanuary 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before\nescalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated\nModern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both *The Oregon\nTrail* and Alcott’s *Little Women*, the other Illustrated Modern Library\ntitle announced for fall 1947.\n\nAt this point the type for *The Oregon Trail* was in galleys and the\nplates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for\nnearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *The\nOregon Trail* without illustrations in the regular ML. *Little Women*\n(431) was added to the regular series the following year.\n\nThe jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss\nmade for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the\nintroduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote\nhim about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume\nwas at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29\nJune 1949).\n\n### 424\n\n**HOWARD HAYCRAFT, ed.

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nStarrett declined the ML’s invitation to revise *Fourteen Great\nDetective Stories* (1928: 155), citing lack of time, the “wildly\ninadequate” fee offered, and his lack of sympathy with the hard-boiled\ngenre which he thought should be represented (Starrett to Maule, 28 July\n1946). The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond\nChandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo\nto Cerf, 23 September 1946).\n\nHaycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight.\nIn his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in\ndetective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the\ngrowth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely\nimitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection\nwas available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has\nexcelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that\nthe hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and\ndistinct form” (p. xii).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed.

  "general": "The postwar history of the Modern Library can be regarded as dating from\nthe beginning of 1949. That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two\nmajor developments: the continuing expansion and consolidation of the\npaperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that\nincreased the importance of the college market.\n\nCerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning. He\ntried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in\npaperback Pocket Book editions. When the ML had exclusive reprint rights\nto copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing\nthem. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books\nto publish two titles that deGraff wanted: Vincent Sheean’s *Personal\nHistory*, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving\nStone’s *Lust for Life*, which had been in the ML for less than a year.\n\nOften the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works.\nThe terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances\nin which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset & Dunlap\nor other hardbound reprint edition. Even if the ML had exclusive reprint\nrights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year\nintervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release\npaperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from\nthe ML when the contract expired.\n\nBefore the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback\neditions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier\nby the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously\naffect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality\npaperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library\nPaperbacks.\n\nRandom House responded to growth in the college market for quality books\nearlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950\nunder the direction of Jess Stein.",

(*Fall 1949; \\[Spring 1956\\]*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published\nfall 1949. *WR* 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nMontaigne’s *Essays* had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first\nin the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford\nUniversity Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation,\nand the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was\nexhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to\nthink about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates\nas editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright\nprotection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and\nquite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947).\nHe then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern\nLibrary Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged.\nThe archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced\nit with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United\nStates. Because there was some question of British rights, we\nvoluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search\nof a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only\navailable ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four\nvolumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and\ncomparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29\nSeptember 1947).\n\nBates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century\ntranslation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the\npublic domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or\nreadability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the\nHazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at\nleast a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The\ncontract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely\nto Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you\ndeem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the\noriginal and to give the best possible modern rendering.”\n\nBates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt\ntranslation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the\nEditor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised\nit, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to\nthe accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to\nmodernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the\ntranslation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text\nstand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do\nconsiderable revising of the translation” (p. \\[vii\\]). Bates did not\nconsider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement\n“completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of\nthe title page be omitted.\n\nThe manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have\nbeen delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his\neditorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.\n\nBates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included\nthe essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion\nof sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain\nin language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one\nof the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and\nquotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed.\nIf you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to\nCommins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in\nfact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or,\nif included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).\n\n#### 419b.

(*Fall 1960*)\n\nIn 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern\nLibrary College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a\nlist of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently\ncut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not\ninclude the publication of this book in the College Editions within the\nnear future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College\nEditions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year\nas we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be\nincorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to\nBates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.\n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously\nbad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML\nconsider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s\ntranslation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,\nLetters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably\nthe definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3\nNovember 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.\nIf he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition\nof Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s *Complete Essays* in 1958, may\nnot have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Florio translation (1933–1945) G10.1\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Trechmann translation (1946–1948) G10.2"

Pell told Hackett in 1954 that\nthe ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random\nHouse he discovered the total was 8,000.

Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page\nselection from the Introduction to *Critique of Pure Reason* was\nincluded. The ML published an abridged edition of *Critique of Pure\nReason* in 1958 (506).\n\nFriedrich wrote Commins that he thought that *The Philosophy of Kant*\nwas a misleading title since large parts of the *Critique* were not\nincluded. He suggested calling the book *Introduction to Kant* or\n*Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy* (Friedrich to Commins,\n20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had\nalready been announced. He argued that *The Philosophy of Kant* did not\nmisrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but\nhe offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to\nFriedrich, 25 July 1949).\n\nWhen he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest\neditor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12\nOctober 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).\n\nSales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950.\n\n#### 422b.

All of the drawings except one for the binding were\nto be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21\nJanuary 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before\nescalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated\nModern Library.

The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond\nChandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo\nto Cerf, 23 September 1946).\n\nHaycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight.\nIn his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in\ndetective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the\ngrowth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely\nimitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection\nwas available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has\nexcelled sufficiently in the short story.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1949 1949 The postwar history of the Modern Library can be regarded as dating from\nthe beginning of 1949. That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two\nmajor developments: the continuing expansion and consolidation of the\npaperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that\nincreased the importance of the college market.\n\nCerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning. He\ntried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in\npaperback Pocket Book editions. When the ML had exclusive reprint rights\nto copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing\nthem. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books\nto publish two titles that deGraff wanted: Vincent Sheean’s *Personal\nHistory*, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving\nStone’s *Lust for Life*, which had been in the ML for less than a year.\n\nOften the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works.\nThe terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances\nin which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset & Dunlap\nor other hardbound reprint edition. Even if the ML had exclusive reprint\nrights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year\nintervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release\npaperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from\nthe ML when the contract expired.\n\nBefore the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback\neditions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier\nby the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously\naffect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality\npaperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library\nPaperbacks.\n\nRandom House responded to growth in the college market for quality books\nearlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950\nunder the direction of Jess Stein. Eleven new titles were added to the ML and five were discontinued,\nbringing the total number of titles in the regular series to 271. Modern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark\nblue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a\ngiven title was typically bound in a single-color combination. The inset\npanels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer Kent’s torchbearer\n(facing left) was stamped in gold. $1.25.

Morton Dauwen Zabel, professor of English at the University of Chicago,\nsuggested a ML edition of Joseph Conrad’s *Under Western Eyes*. He\nwrote, “I can think of no novel of Conrad’s outside of Lord Jim,\nVictory, and Heart of Darkness (all of them already included in the\nModern Library) which more deserves to be known. The general neglect of\nit, hitherto, is a shame” (Zabel to Jess Stein, 31 October 1949). Stein\nforwarded the suggestion to Cerf, but the general consensus was that\nthere was insufficient demand to justify a ML edition.
