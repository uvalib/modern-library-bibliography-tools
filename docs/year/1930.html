<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1930</h1>
<h2>1930</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The Modern Library’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City
Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in
hard-cover reprints, was announced on 4 April. The Sun Dial Library had
been in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary
works similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it
included fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun
Dial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American
series that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf
regarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April
1930).</p>
<p>The purchase of the Sun Dial Library gave the Modern Library access to a
number of titles that Cerf and Klopfer had tried to secure from
Doubleday in the past. The series included major works by Joseph Conrad,
Aldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, William McFee, and Christopher
Morley, all of whom were Doubleday authors. Other desirable titles in
the series included Katherine Mansfield’s <em>Garden Party</em>, Bram Stoker’s
<em>Dracula</em>, and H. G. Wells’s <em>Tono-Bungay</em>.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement the Modern Library secured reprint rights to
four Doubleday titles—Arnold Bennett’s <em>Old Wives’ Tale</em>, Aldous
Huxley’s <em>Point Counter Point</em>, W. Somerset Maugham’s <em>Of Human
Bondage</em>, and Horace Walpole’s <em>Fortitude</em>—that were not part of the Sun
Dial Library. Cerf and Klopfer had been trying to secure reprint rights
to these titles for several years. The Modern Library agreed to pay
Doubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy for these four titles—two
cents more than Cerf and Klopfer were then paying for any other book in
the ML with the exception of Dreiser’s <em>Twelve Men</em> (159). The four
titles were added to the Modern Library between September 1930 and
January 1931.</p>
<p>Eleven of the 53 titles in the Sun Dial Library were added to the ML
between 1931 and 1937: Conrad, <em>Lord Jim</em> (210); Mansfield, <em>The Garden
Party</em> (214); Morley, <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em> (213); McFee, <em>Casuals of
the Sea</em> (223); Wells, <em>Tono-Bungay</em> (225); Stoker, <em>Dracula</em> (231);
Conrad, <em>Victory</em> (238); Dos Passos, <em>Three Soldiers</em> (248); Huxley,
<em>Antic Hay</em> (233); Maugham, <em>Moon and Sixpence</em> (283); and Collins, <em>The
Moonstone</em> (G31). All of these except <em>The Moonstone</em> appear to have
been protected by copyright and could not have been included in the ML
without the permission of Doubleday, Doran.</p>
<p>The purchase of the Sun Dial Library was a straight cash transaction.
The Modern Library acquired the entire stock of Sun Dial Library books,
about 87,000 volumes, and got the right for five years to add any title
from the series for which Doubleday, Doran controlled the copyright. No
plates were involved since Garden City Publishing Co., like other
reprint publishers, printed from the original publishers’ plates. The
total cost was just under $25,000. This represented the exact
manufacturing cost of each volume, a royalty of ten cents a copy, and an
additional payment of $5,000.</p>
<p>The books were transferred to the Modern Library’s warehouse at the
Wolff Bindery in New York. Cerf estimated that no more than half of the
books could be sold at full price. Cerf and Klopfer hoped at first to
sell enough books at the regular price to enable them to remainder the
rest at the end of the year and still break even (Cerf to Crowder, 10
April 1930). Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, the big New York department
stores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them
at sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to
60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned
the idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan
Co. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were
being offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55
percent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big
account in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but
Cerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J.
Smalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931).</p>
<p>Other ways were found to dispose of the weakest titles. Many of them
were bartered for Modern Library advertising in college newspapers, and
several booksellers agreed to accept Sun Dial Library books as the
Modern Library’s contribution toward cooperative advertising. By
September 1933 the Sun Dial Library stock was almost gone.</p>
<p>Cerf commented to the ML’s senior sales representative, “Considering the
general depression, our Modern Library sales seem to be holding up
wonderfully. The new picture jackets help, and the Fall additions should
cause general satisfaction, I believe” (Cerf to Crowder, 11 July 1930).</p>
<p>The ML ordered new typesettings and plates for three of its most popular
titles: Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (199), Bennett, <em>Old Wives Tale</em>
(207), and Stoker, <em>Dracula</em> (231).</p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway paid tribute to the ML’s format in December 1930. He
had shattered his arm in a serious car accident in early November and
was recuperating in Key West after spending seven weeks in a Billings,
Montana hospital. In a letter to Cerf typed by his wife Pauline he
gratefully described Modern Library books as “the proper size for
one-handed reading” (Hemingway to Cerf, 26 December 1930).</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Nineteen titles were added and four were discontinued, bringing the
number of active titles to 182. Minor discrepancies between the number
of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due
primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January
publication on fall lists. Fall 1930 jackets also list Merejkowski,</p>
<p><em>Peter and Alexis</em> (227), which was originally announced for August 1930
but was delayed until December 1931.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding
measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼
in. (164 x 107 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages
on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32
pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side
of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>Except for Rockwell Kent’s <em>Wilderness</em> (205) all new titles had the
final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face
type and <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>, A3, or C1 (see individual entries).
<em>Wilderness</em> had an individually designed title page featuring an
illustration by Kent; <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/B.webp'>torchbearer B</uvalib-modal-image-button> appears on the verso of the title
page.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,
blue, green, and brown, with each title published in all four bindings.
See the illustration of Huysmans, <em>Against the Grain</em>, which shows four
copies of the fall 1930 first printing, each in a binding of a different
color.</p>
<p>Rockwell Kent’s B1 binding with the grape vine design at the base of the
spine and his torchbearer stamped in gold on the front panel was used in
its full form through spring 1930. The additional gold required for the
B1 binding increased the ML’s costs by half a cent per volume, and the
binding was discontinued after a single season.</p>
<p>The balloon cloth B2 binding was used for the first seven titles
published in fall 1930. The B2 binding is identical to B1 except for the
torchbearer, which is blind stamped on the front panel. Titles published
initially in the B2 binding are Cervantes, <em>Don Quixote</em> (197), Mencken,
<em>Selected Prejudices</em> (198), Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (199), Goethe,
<em>Faust</em> (200), Walpole, <em>Fortitude</em> (201), Young, <em>The Medici</em> (202),
and Huxley, <em>Point Counter Point</em> (203).</p>
<p>Balloon cloth binding C replaced Kent’s original design for the last
three titles published in 1930: Plato, <em>Works</em> (204), Kent, <em>Wilderness</em>
(205), and Huysmans, <em>Against the Grain</em> (206). Kent’s grape vine design
is omitted from the spine, but his torchbearer, reduced in size from 36
to 27 mm, is again stamped in gold on the front panel. Balloon cloth
binding C was used through April 1931 and was superseded by balloon
cloth binding D in May 1931.</p>
<p>Early in 1930 Klopfer asked H. Wolff, the ML’s bindery, to look into the
potential savings of using imitation gold (“oriental tissue”) instead of
genuine gold on the bindings, noting that it would have to save at least
a penny per book to make the change worthwhile (Klopfer to Bert Wolff,
23 January 1930). Wolff indicated that imitation gold would save .003
per copy or $3.00 per thousand—a savings of $1,500–1,800 a year (Wolff
to Klopfer, 20 January 1930). As a test Klopfer asked that the ML’s May
title, <em>Oriental Romances</em> (196), be stamped in imitation gold. Wolff
mistakenly used imitation gold on the ML’s entire current binding order
of 118,404 volumes instead of genuine gold as specified in the contract
(RH Box 766, Wolff folder). Balloon cloth binding B2 with the
torchbearer blind stamped on the front panel appears to have been the
solution to the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Library Edition</strong></p>
<p>Twenty-five ML titles were offered in special bindings for the library
market. The flexible balloon cloth bindings used for volumes sold in
stores did not withstand repeated readings and thus were not well suited
to library use. Volumes in the “Library Edition” were bound in sturdy
blue buckram over stiff boards with headbands at the head and foot of
the spine. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings in the regular ML, the
bindings were reinforced with mull, also known as crash—a strip of
sturdy starched fabric that was glued over the folded gatherings at the
spine, with flaps extending about half an inch on each side that were
glued to the inside of the front and back boards. The titles were:</p>
<p><em>American Poetry</em> <em>1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology</em>, ed. Aiken
(169.1)</p>
<p>Beebe, <em>Jungle Peace</em> (116)</p>
<p><em>Best Ghost Stories</em> (67)</p>
<p><em>Best Russian Short Stories</em>, ed. Seltzer (18)</p>
<p>Brontë, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (120)</p>
<p>Carroll, <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass,
The Hunting of the Snark</em> (111)</p>
<p>Cellini, <em>Autobiography</em> (132)</p>
<p>Dostoyevsky, <em>Brothers Karamazov</em> (171)</p>
<p>Douglas, <em>South Wind</em> (114)</p>
<p><em>Fourteen Great Detective Stories</em>, ed. Starrett (155)</p>
<p>France, <em>Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard</em> (21)</p>
<p>Hardy, <em>Return of the Native</em> (126)</p>
<p>Hudson, <em>Green Mansions</em> (90)</p>
<p>Ibsen, <em>A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People</em> (6)</p>
<p>Lewisohn, <em>Up Stream</em> (128)</p>
<p>Melville, <em>Moby Dick</em> (124)</p>
<p>Meredith, <em>Diana of the Crossways</em> (14)</p>
<p>Meredith, <em>Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em> (144)</p>
<p>Merejkowski, <em>Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em> (154)</p>
<p>Nietzsche, <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> (9)</p>
<p>Schreiner, <em>Story of an African Farm</em> (142)</p>
<p>Sterne, <em>Tristram Shandy</em> (158)</p>
<p>Symonds, <em>Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti</em> (164)</p>
<p>Wilde, <em>Picture of Dorian Gray</em> (1)</p>
<p>Wilde, <em>Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan</em>
(76)</p>
<p>Fifteen of the titles were ones that Cerf and Klopfer added between fall
1925 and 1928; ten had originally appeared in the Boni &amp; Liveright
series. The attempt to market ML books to libraries was not a success,
probably because the small size of the volumes and the narrow margins
did not allow for rebinding.</p>
<p>Buckram bindings for the library market were again made available for
many ML titles in the 1960s, more than twenty years after the ML
introduced its larger format. This time the optional buckram bindings
appear to have been successful.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Rockwell Kent endpapers used in spring 1930 were available in three
different colors and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth
bindings. Blue and green bindings continued to be paired with pale green
(149) endpapers; brown bindings examined had light reddish brown (42)
endpapers; and red bindings had endpapers in light orange (52).</p>
<p>Beginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were in moderate orange (53).
Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from
fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for the oversize volume, John
Reed, <em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em> (1935: 280) and three spring 1939
titles—Irving Stone, <em>Lust for Life</em> (317), Isak Dinesen, <em>Seven Gothic
Tales</em> (320), and <em>Six Plays of Clifford Odets</em> (321) that were
published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles
beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was
introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s
torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books
and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>Ten of the 1930 titles were published in individually designed pictorial
jackets. Seven appeared in uniform typographic jacket D. Maugham, <em>Of
Human Bondage</em> (199) was published in uniform typographic jacket E;
Huxley, <em>Point Counter Point</em> (203) had a non-pictorial jacket designed
by E. McKnight Kauffer.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Hemingway, <em>Sun Also Rises</em> xGoethe, <em>Faust</em>. (Fall) Goethe,
<em>Faust</em> xConrad, <em>Lord Jim</em>.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf wanted to include John Galsworthy’s <em>Forsyte Saga</em> in the Modern
Library but realized that Scribner’s was unlikely to grant reprint
rights. He wrote Maxwell Perkins in 1930, “I eagerly await hearing of
Mr. Scribner’s reaction to my suggestion for the <em>Forsyte Saga</em>. I hope
that I did not move him to physical violence. I am convinced the idea is
not as ridiculous as it very likely appears at first blush” (Cerf to
Perkins, 4 December 1930). Perkins replied that there was no possibility
of granting reprint rights (Perkins to Cerf, 4 December 1930). Nine
years later Cerf offered an advance of $7,500 to publish <em>The Forsyte
Saga</em> as a Giant (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939). Galsworthy’s
sequence of three novels and two interludes never appeared in the ML.</p>
<p>Cerf contacted John W. Luce &amp; Co. about rights to a John Millington
Synge anthology (Cerf to Mr. Schaff, 23 June 1930). Cerf contacted
Longman’s for the rights to H. Rider Haggard’s <em>She</em>, J. C. Van Dyke’s
<em>History of Painting</em>, and G. F. Young’s history from 44 B.C. to 1453
A.D., <em>East and West through Fifteen Centuries</em> (Cerf to J. Ray Beck, 25
September 1930). The only one of these titles that was ever added to the
ML was <em>She</em>—and that was over 25 years later, when Haggard’s <em>She &amp;
King Solomon’s Mines</em> (492) appeared in the ML in 1957.</p>
<p>James Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,
suggested Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> and <em>The Sayings of Confucius</em> (Crowder to
Cerf, 12 April 1930 and 30 September 1930). <em>Faust</em> (200) was published
in the ML that fall. <em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> (312) appeared in the ML
in 1938 and became one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. V. F.
Calverton, who edited <em>An Anthology of American Negro Literature</em> (183)
for the ML in 1929, offered to edit <em>Tales of E. T. A. Hoffman</em> for the
series; Cerf indicated that the book was a possibility in the future
(Cerf to Calverton, 10 December 1930).</p>
<p>The ML decided not to publish Guillaume Apollinaire’s <em>La Rome des
Borgia</em> after a reader’s report judged it pornographic and valueless as
history. The reader commented, “The whole simply stinks of obscenity and
abnormality” (“Ray” to Klopfer, 18 February 1930).</p>
<p>Ferris Greenslet urged Cerf to publish a ML edition of Alain-Fournier’s
novel <em>The Wanderer</em> (<em>Le Grand Meaulnes</em>), which was originally
published in Paris in 1913 and appeared in an English translation
published by Houghton Mifflin in 1928, fourteen years after the young
author’s death in action in the First World War. “I hope very much that
you are going to feel like doing something about THE WANDERER, both
because we would like the business and because I personally have a
profound interest in extending the reputation of Alain Fournier”
(Greenslet to Cerf, 5 September 1930). Cerf appears to have been
skeptical about its sales potential. Roger L. Scaife, who would move
from Houghton Mifflin to Little, Brown &amp; Co. a short time later, replied
to Cerf: “You may be right about THE WANDERER. The story took hold of us
here so strongly that we thought it a gem that should be preserved and
sold year after year. Whether that is possible or not, I do not know.
Your judgment is understandably better than mine in this case” (Scaife
to Cerf, 6 October 1930). A new English translation by Frank Davison was
published in 1959 under the title <em>The Lost Domain</em> by Oxford University
Press in its World’s Classics series and reprinted in Penguin Modern
Classics as <em>Le Grand Meaulnes</em> in 1966. A third English translation by
Robin Buss appeared in Penguin Classics in 2007 under the title <em>The
Lost Estate</em>.</p>
<p>The Marxist poet and novelist Isidor Schneider, who was in charge of
advertising at Horace Liveright, Inc., and whose wife, Helen Berlin, had
been Cerf and Klopfer’s first secretary, recommended Ivan Goncharov’s
<em>Oblomov</em> for the ML. The Natalie Duddington translation, published by
Macmillan the previous year, was the first complete translation in
English. Schneider, who later served as literary editor of the <em>New
Masses</em>, considered <em>Oblomov</em> one of the world’s ten best novels
(Schneider to Cerf, 1 April 1930; Schneider Special Manuscript
Collection, Columbia University Library). The Duddington translation was
published in Everyman’s Library in 1932, but <em>Oblomov</em> was never added
in the ML.</p>

Controversies over the merits of favorite short stories are endless.
Everyone is staunch in his own preferences and can argue at length in
their behalf. The tales collected in this volume support no theory,
nor do they follow a pattern intended to emphasize a special set of
virtues; they are catholic in choice and represent the most notable
works in the short-story form of such masters as Joseph Conrad, John
Galsworthy, Somerset Maugham, Katherine Mansfield, D. H. Lawrence,
Ernest Hemingway, Willa Cather, James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Sherwood Anderson and Glenway Westcott. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Published January 1930. <em>WR</em> 8 February 1930.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1943. Superseded
1943 by <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em>, ed. Bennett Cerf (361).</p>
<p>Most of the stories were selected by Cerf and Klopfer rather than
Overton (see 361). Even so, Cerf thought that the anthology contained
“glaring defects” and acknowledged, “Copyright difficulties . . .
prevented our putting into this volume exactly what we would have liked
to include” (Cerf to A. E. Coppard, 6 September 1934).</p>
<p>Overton’s anthology and its successor sold 12,699 copies during the
18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it fourteenth out of 271
ML and Giant titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For sheer terror, for the spectral power to fasten itself upon the
imagination, stirring and tormenting it, <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> is
the apotheosis of the macabre in literature. Without abatement, it
arouses the senses and numbs them, clutches at the heart and makes it
beat faster, while it unfolds one of the greatest ghost stories of all
time. <em>The Lesson of the Master</em> portrays the inevitable penalties
imposed on those who cherish a dream of perfection. It reveals Henry
James as an incomparable story-teller and stylist. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by the Macmillan Co., 1898 (<em>The Turn of the
Screw</em>) and 1892 (<em>The Lesson of the Master</em>). ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for January
1930. <em>WR</em> 8 March 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML’s original intent was to publish <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> only, to
print from Macmillan plates, and to pay a $1,000 advance against
royalties of 8 cents a copy (H. C. Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26
November 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to
write an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March
1929).</p>
<p>Final publication plans took shape in January 1930, when Macmillan
granted permission to add <em>The Lesson of the Master</em> for an additional
payment of $100 (Latham to ML, 10 January 1930). Broun’s introduction,
dated January 1930, makes no reference to <em>The Lesson of the Master</em>.
The ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed
publication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both
works entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying
royalties of 2 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master</em> ranked in the third
quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May
1942–October 1943, just below <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> (291). James’s
sales improved significantly by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month
period November 1951–October 1952 <em>The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of
the Master</em> sold 3,734 copies, making it seventy-fourth of the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML. James’s <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> sold
5,345 copies, placing it thirty-ninth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Instead of beginning his career as a writer of promise, Ernest
Hemingway startled the world, and especially his own generation, with
<em>The Sun Also Rises</em>, his first full-length novel. The disinherited
and disillusioned survivors of the World War discovered in him their
spokesman, a writer free of sentimentality and cant who could summon
forth characters true to their own experience and way of life. <em>The
Sun Also Rises</em> is a chronicle of a lost generation drifting,
frustrated and demoralized, to its doom. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition (pp.
[xi]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930. <em>WR</em>
8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.</p>
<p>The ML paid Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a
copy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as
1927, when he offered a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a
copy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New
York Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was
pleased that <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> was to appear in the series. But he
declined Cerf’s offer of $200 to write an introduction—four times what
F. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML
edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>—explaining that he couldn’t write an
introduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to
write it would be taking $200 out of some critics [<em>sic</em>] pocket—but
beside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to
Cerf, 4 January 1930).</p>
<p>Printings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930),
5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies
(December 1934). <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> was the eighteenth best-selling ML
title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file).
It sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.
It sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML.</p>
<p>Curiously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition of <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>,
despite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and
Unabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being
Jewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he
learned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he
had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the
third paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of
one of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the
richest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter
XVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a
bull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out
badly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a
bull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).</p>
<p>Scribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more
vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three
Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29
October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that <em>The Sun Also
Rises</em> would be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,
Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound
reprint in April 1953 and a $1.45 paperback in August 1957.</p>

<p>Original U.S. publication of Constance Garnett translation not
ascertained**.** ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published February 1930. <em>WR</em> 8 March 1930. First printing:
20,000 copies. Superseded fall 1965 by revised translation (191.2).
Klopfer asked the ML’s printer to order enough paper for 20,000 copies
of <em>Anna Karenina</em> (Klopfer to Mr. Wilkins, H. Wolff Estate, 4 December
1929). The paper was the same stock used for <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>
(171.1a).</p>
<p><em>Anna Karenina</em> appears to have been the best-selling title in the ML in
1931 and the eighth best-selling title in 1934. It ranked low in the
first quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October
1943 and moved up a few notches during the 12-month period November

disregards Tolstoy the man. As a man, he represents the best of
nineteenth-century humanitarianism and a generous Christian morality.
As a writer, he towers above all the literary figures of his time, and
his two great novels—<em>War and Peace</em> (Modern Library Giant G-1) and
<em>Anna Karenina</em>—are universally acclaimed as classics. Anna of the
latter novel is considered the most notable character in the vast
gallery of the great and obscure people who live in the pages of his
works. The translation from the Russian by Constance Garnett is
complete and unabridged. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.
Several authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat
accepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale
University. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed,
“Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of
Anna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs.
Karenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28
January 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that
were corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to
extend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek
was willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance
against a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart
for his introduction to Gogol’s <em>Dead Souls</em>. Stein indicated that $200
was all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to
Stein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon
College and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell
University, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an
introduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in
any case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March
1950).</p>
<p>Troyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s $200 fee (Troyat to
Stein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J.
Robert Loy of Columbia University.</p>

<em>ANNA KARENINA</em> was begun in 1873, seven years after the publication
of <em>War and Peace</em>, and appeared in installments from 1875 to 1877. It
is one of Tolstoy’s masterpieces, written at the height of his power
and reflecting almost every aspect of his method and attitudes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
A bright constellation of artists, dilettantes and voluptuaries made
Bohemian New York a haven for the practitioners of all the deadly
sins. Into their midst came Easter Brandès with her operatic ambitions
and luminous beauty. A great Isolde, she had the morals of a soprano
and the heart of a pawnbroker. <em>Painted Veils</em> is the story of her
career as a singing harlot in a modern Babylon. It is told with the
irrepressible mirth and flavor of that shrewd and ever-fascinating
promenader among the seven arts— James Huneker. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1920. New bibliographical
edition published by Horace Liveright, 1928. ML edition (pp. [5]–310)
printed from 1928 Liveright plates with pp. [5] and [9] transposed.
Published March 1930. <em>WR</em> 12 April 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1942.</p>
<p>The ML paid Liveright a $5,000 advance. <em>Painted Veils</em> was the ML’s
best-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s <em>Sun Also Rises</em>
(190) and Merejkowski’s <em>Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em> (154). It
continued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty
best-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117,
Publicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in
September 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML
printings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.</p>
<p>Shortly after <em>Painted Veils</em> was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith,
the editor-in-chief of Boni &amp; Liveright, suggested a ML edition of
Huneker’s autobiography <em>Steeplejack</em> (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930).
Cerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you
really think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no
question that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to
Smith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles
Scribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker
titles it published, such as <em>Essays</em>, selected and introduced by H. L.
Mencken (1929) or <em>Steeplejack</em>. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s
glory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern
Library (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936).
The ML edition of <em>Painted Veils</em> was discontinued six years later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
As eminent among modern dramatists as he is among short-story writers,
Anton Tchekov is here represented by seven of his most important
plays. For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp
and poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding,
these plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Tchekov
world famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal
experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not
only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most
revered. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B1:</em> Pictorial in vivid red (11), black and gold on coated white
paper with drawing of Russian city with bridge over a river on inset

background in black lined in gold. Designed by Paul Galdone, October
1937, for <em>Stories of Anton Tchekov</em> (232b jacket B); unsigned. Front

<p>Superseded by Chekhov, <em>Best Plays</em>, trans. Stark Young (1956–86) 487</p>
<p><em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em> ranked in the third quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It was
not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the
spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use
of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to <em>The Plays of Anton
Tchekov</em> (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of
that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to
“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of <em>Best Plays</em>.</p>

<p>Cerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an
advance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot
Holt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a
college text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E.
Holt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when
Herschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a
reorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince
the new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John
Dewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a
copy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first
payment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that
over for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13
February 1928).</p>
<p>By 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told
Cerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to
Cerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an
introduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and
suggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to <em>The Dance of Life</em>
(1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to
write the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey
to Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to
the ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense.
Dewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library
Edition” since <em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> already included a preface and
an introduction by Dewey.</p>
<p>Someone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his
introduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was
paginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part
of the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the
mistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the
last page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on
its verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing.
In its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8
leaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all
remaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first
printing. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of
the contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and
the first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of
the second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected
copies became the first state of the first printing.</p>
<p>There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third
printing of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine
printings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A
printing of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper
rationing.</p>
<p><em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> was low in the third quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It
ranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period
November 1952–October 1953.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The dean of American philosophy gives here the fruit of his lifelong
researches in the dynamic interaction between human nature and the
social environment. His thesis is the continuity of nature, man and
society. Upon this conception he argues for a free and realistic
morality and interprets individual and social psychology. The
conclusions drawn by Professor Dewey provide a set of values to which
the modern mind can subscribe with the fullest accord. <em>Human Nature
and Conduct</em> is an essential contribution to a better understanding of
social relations. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

with ink-and-wash drawing of a mounted Don Quixote holding a lance with
Sancho Panza following behind him on a donkey; lettering in black, all

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This translation by Samuel Putnam—which has been greeted as a literary
event of the first magnitude—captures for the first time in English
the glory and the humor, the meaning and the feeling of the original.
<em>Don Quixote</em>, the first modern novel, has for three and a half
centuries maintained its place in the affections of every generation
of readers. Its appeal is universal and inexhaustible—it has been
called “the Bible of Humility” by the renowned French critic
Saint-Beuve.</p>
<p>The Samuel Putnam translation is now available, complete and
unabridged, in this handsomely printed one–volume edition, with a
critical text based upon the first editions of 1605 and 1615, and with
variant readings, variorum notes, and an Introduction by the
translator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putnam translation originally published in two volumes by Viking Press,
1949. ML edition (pp. [v]–1043) printed from offset plates
photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published fall 1964.
<em>WR</em> 2 November 1964. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>The Putnam translation replaced Ozell’s revision of the Peter Motteux
translation in MLG in spring 1965. The offset plates for the Giant are
also photographically reduced from the Viking edition, but the larger
format of the Giant made possible a smaller reduction and resulted in a
far more readable book. The reduction in the text page of 197.2 is about
18 percent as opposed to about 8 percent for the Giant (G14.2).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The irrepressible H. L. Mencken cuts loose at his favorite <em>bêtes
noires</em> with diabolical relish. He swings his bludgeon at matters
divine and terrestrial, and, in passing, he thwacks the sit-spots of
the respected and the revered, or bestows here and there an ungrudging
accolade on the few who have attained the stature of titans.
Prohibition, politics, pacifism, big business, beauty and birth
control are among the targets for his shafts. In all, <em>Selected
Prejudices</em> is a bristling and mordant commentary on the variegated
world we live in. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The history of W. Somerset Maugham’s masterpiece is a significant
commentary on the changing and maturing taste in fiction. When it
appeared in 1915, a few discerning critics hailed it as one of the
first important novels of the twentieth century. For several years the
public remained apathetic and the book almost suffered the fate of the
casual novel. But its loyal champions fought to save it from oblivion.
Today, no more popular novel exists in the English language. It has
been one of the two best sellers in the entire Modern Library series
for the last three years. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except on coated light yellow (86) paper. (<em>Fall
1939</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1915, and from 1927
by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>]–766) printed from
Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. Published September
1930. <em>WR</em> 18 October 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four
long-sought Doubleday titles—<em>Of Human Bondage</em>, Walpole’s <em>Fortitude</em>
(201), Huxley’s <em>Point Counter Point</em> (203), and Bennett’s <em>Old Wives’
Tale</em> (207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden
City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a
$6,000 advance for <em>Of Human Bondage</em> and agreed to pay royalties of 12
cents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was
then paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’s <em>Twelve Men</em>
(159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January
1931. Doubleday’s new plates <em>Of Human Bondage</em> were originally intended
for the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden
City Publishing Co. around 1933.</p>
<p>In April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent
of the list price, which was then $2.45. Royalties on the Vintage
paperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a
$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the
total was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of $10,000 due on1
January 1969 and 1 January 1970.</p>
<p>In 1968 the ML considered transferring <em>Of Human Bondage</em> to the Giants
series, which would have involved photographing the book and making new
plates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.</p>
<p><em>Of Human Bondage</em> was one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It
ranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication
date, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH
box 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in
1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as
follows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and
11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not
calendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been
sold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf
to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the
18-month period May 1942–October 1943 <em>Of Human Bondage</em> sold 18,505
copies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the
fourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more
copies than Dostoyevsky’s <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (228), then the second
best-selling title in the regular series. By the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s best-selling title with sales
of 11,563 copies.</p>

<p>The plates for <em>Of Human Bondage</em> and Maugham’s <em>Moon and Sixpence</em>
(283) were becoming worn by 1944 and Haas decided to make new plates for
both titles. Freiman contacted Doubleday, Doran to determine whether it
was willing to supply new plates or at least pay part of the cost
(Freiman memo to Haas, 13 November 1944). Doubleday, Doran agreed to
reset and make new plates for both titles at its own expense as long as
the ML agreed to keep them in print and promote them aggressively for at
least ten years (Cedric R. Crowell, Doubleday, Doran, to Commins, 2
January 1945). The new plates were delivered to the ML’s printers in
December 1945. The ML instructed Parkway Printing Co. to dispose of the
old plates and use the new ones for all future printings (Regina Spirito
to Bill Simon, Parkway Printing, 13 December 1945).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Of Human Bondage</em> has remained one of the most popular novels in the
English language since its original publication in 1915. Its
description of the impact of the British public school system on the
growth of an individual is still a definitive one. The torment of a
young man involved in an obsessive and destructive love is delineated
with compassion and insight, making this one of the most intelligent
and important statements on the process of self-discovery. Maugham’s
gift as a storyteller has never been more clearly demonstrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 1968, when the list price was $2.45, the ML increased the
royalty rate from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent of the list price. The
new reprint contract also called for a 15 percent royalty on the Vintage
paperback edition and a $30,000 advance against royalties for both
editions. Even with the higher royalty <em>Of Human Bondage</em> remained a
profitable title for the ML (John J. Simon, memo to Tony Wimpfeimer, 14
May 1968).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Readers, critics and commentators have found <em>Faust</em> inexhaustible in
its new and illuminating riches. For a century and a quarter it has
held its place among the world’s treasures. The variety and beauty of
its plan and the depth of its implications give it the immortality for
which its central character bargained with his soul. Faust remains the
personification of humanity, tempted and tormented, groping toward the
light. Of the fifty translations of the masterpiece, Bayard Taylor’s,
in the original metres, most completely retains Goethe’s intention and
spirit. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

Lange received $150 for his introduction (Stein to Lange, 25 January

preface to Part I, which dealt with problems of the translation, the
introduction to Part II, which was a general commentary, and the poem
“An Goethe.” He suggested that anything pertinent in Taylor’s preface
and introduction should be included in Lange’s introduction (Stein to

<p><em>Fortitude</em> was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML secured
reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library from Garden
City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of
12 cents a copy. Cerf told the press agent Lynn Farnol that Walpole
received the highest advance against royalties that the ML had ever paid
(Cerf to Farnol, 14 May 1941), but the amount was not indicated—and of
course the advance would have been paid to Doubleday, Doran, which would
have split it with Walpole.</p>
<p>Cerf was unhappy with the appearance of the first printing. The plates,
he told Doubleday, “are lousy, and we need some new ones” (Cerf to
Robert de Graff, Garden City Pub. Co., 5 November 1930). When he sent a
copy of the first printing to Walpole he apologized for its appearance
and indicated that Doubleday had promised to supply new plates for
subsequent printings (Cerf to Walpole, 26 November 1930).</p>
<p><em>Fortitude</em> was in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It was
not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the whole imposing list of novels written by Hugh Walpole there is
none that has reached and maintained the popularity of <em>Fortitude</em>.
The absorbing interest of its romantic story, its enthusiasm and its
conviction make of it a rare phenomenon among books in an epoch of
uncompromising realism. That it is Mr. Walpole’s favorite among all
his novels can be readily understood. He says of it: “<em>Fortitude</em> is a
romance—a fairy-tale about a young man who very naively believed in
almost everything.” (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. The
plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. First printing
from the new plates: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>All subsequent ML printings were from the new plates. The second and
third printings from these plates in September 1934 and April 1936 were
for 2,000 copies each. Sales declined significantly by the 1960s; 1967
sales were 600 copies.</p>

<p>In its advertising the ML emphasized, “This book has been available only
in two bulky volumes, that sold for ten dollars and over” (<em>PW</em> 118, 16
August 1930, p. 574).</p>
<p>Shortly after the ML edition appeared Cerf authorized Garden City
Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran reprint subsidiary, to make a
duplicate set of the ML’s plates for a fee of $1,000. Garden City was
planning to publish <em>The Medici</em> under its Star Dollar Books imprint
(Cerf to Robert de Graff, Garden City, 30 December 1930). No evidence of
a printing in Star Dollar Books or any other Doubleday imprint has been
found.</p>
<p>Charles Boni used the ML plates in 1930 for a single printing of <em>The
Medici</em> in the format the ML would adopt the following year for the new
ML Giants series. Later that year Cerf and Klopfer bought the remaining
stock from A. &amp; C. Boni and sold it along with a printing of <em>The
Education of Henry Adams</em> that they had produced in a similar format.
The books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to
department stores as dollar “specials.”</p>
<p>An illustrated edition of <em>The Medici</em> (G8), printed from plates of the
regular ML edition, was published in ML Giants, 1933–49.</p>
<p><em>The Medici</em> was one of several titles that were omitted from a
comprehensive ranking of ML sales for the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943. The regular ML edition sold 3,300 copies during the
12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the second
quarter of ML titles in terms of sales.</p>

Young to sift the proven facts from the exaggerations and to present a

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1928. ML edition
printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting that
appears to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published November
1930. <em>WR</em> 29 November 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued
1967.</p>
<p><em>Point Counter Point</em> was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML
secured reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library
from Garden City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran
a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Most ML royalties
were based on the number of copies printed; the royalties for <em>Point
Counter Point</em> were based on sales.</p>
<p>There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in August 1931 and a third
printing of 4,000 copies in November 1932. <em>Point Counter Point</em> was low
in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month
period May 1942–October 1943. Sales improved significantly by the early
1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 <em>Point
Counter Point</em> was the 27th best-selling title in the ML.</p>
<p>In 1939 Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and the publishing rights to
Huxley’s older books to Harper &amp; Bros. Cerf expressed the hope that
<em>Point Counter Point</em> and <em>Antic Hay</em> could remain in the ML “for a long
time to come” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros., 27 February 1939).
Harper’s considered publishing the titles in full-priced editions at
$2.50 and was concerned about the income it could expect from the ML
editions. Unless the income was substantial, Hoyns indicated, the ML
editions “might turn out to be a very unprofitable arrangement from our
point of view” (Hoyns to Klopfer, 17 March 1939).</p>
<p>Klopfer and Hoyns met over lunch to discuss the matter. Shortly before
the meeting Klopfer wrote directly to Huxley, who was a personal friend:
“Help, help, Harper’s are threatening to take POINT COUNTER POINT and
ANTIC HAY away from us. These two books belong in the Modern Library and
it would be a crime not to have them available in a cheaper
edition. . . . Could you influence the Harper office in any way in our
favor? I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can
make a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a
strong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive
reprint, rather than just in the $2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to
Huxley, 20 March 1939).</p>
<p>Klopfer’s appeal appears to have been successful. Following the lunch
Klopfer sent Hoyns new five-year contracts for the books. The <em>Point
Counter Point</em> contract called for the ML to pay a $1,200 advance
against royalties of 12 cents a copy and included a special clause that
allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a
reprint of at least 5,000 copies after three years.</p>
<p>In 1965 Harper &amp; Row gave six months’ notice that the ML contract was
being terminated so that <em>Point Counter Point</em> could be included in its
own hardbound series, Perennial Classics (Virginia Olson, Harper &amp; Row,
to Epstein, 23 July 1965). The ML was allowed to sell out its stock on
hand, which consisted of 4,400 copies (Epstein to Olson, 9 August 1965).
The ML edition was out of stock by summer 1967.</p>

The philosopher of idealism, Plato remains the spokesman for all those
who are perennially young in their love of wisdom and their curiosity
about the mysteries of the human soul. The poetic charm and the
dramatic suggestiveness of his writings lend persuasion to Plato’s
central theme—the clarification and harmonizing of life by reason.
Under the brilliant editorship of Irwin Edman, the Modern Library
edition of <em>The Philosophy of Plato</em>, in the Jewett Translation, is
the most comprehensive collection of Plato’s works issued in a single
volume. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

<p>Edman’s edition of <em>The Works of Plato</em> was originally published by
Simon and Schuster, 1928. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published November 1930. <em>WR</em> 29 November 1930. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Edman’s selection included ten dialogues from the third edition of <em>The
Dialogues of Plato</em>, translated into English with introductions and
analyses by B. Jowett (5 vols., Oxford University Press, 1892). Edman
omitted Jowett’s lengthy introductions and analyses, but the Simon and
Schuster edition retains Jowett’s marginal notes. Fourteen dialogues
were omitted. Simon and Schuster used the word “abridged” on the title
page; the ML title page, which indicates that the volume was “selected
and edited” by Edman, was clearer and more accurate.</p>
<p>The Simon and Schuster plates were too wide for the ML’s format. The ML
reset the entire work, omitting the marginal notes. The ML paid Simon
and Schuster royalties of 7 cents a copy, of which Edman appears to have
received 5 cents.</p>
<p><em>The Works of Plato</em> sold 10,848 copies during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943, making it the 26th best-selling title in the ML.
Sales were even better in the early 1950s. During the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s eighth best-selling title.</p>

<p>“. . . in these writings, unique at once in the history of literature
and the history of philosophy, [the reader] meets thought whose
medium is not dogma but drama, drama among whose chief excitements are
the subtle suspenses of thought. . . . The ‘philosophy’ of Plato is
clearly not a philosophy of the schools; his drama is profounder in
theme and more comprehensive in range than the constricted little toys
of the stage. For those who have not learned with Plato that
philosophy is the love of wisdom rather than the pronouncement of
truth, there is considerable mystification in a thinker whose thoughts
are all suggestions, whose suggestions are often playful, and who will
not, despite the attempt of more than one serious critic, be crammed
into a neat and lifeless system. The reader is haunted, too, by the
perturbed sense that, though these dialogues are full of endless charm
as poetic and ironic drama, they are clearly more than the by-play of
a gifted writer. The further one reads the more deeply does one come
into the presence of the profoundest and most serious issues of human
existence. What on its winning surface is the spirited conversation
between Socrates and a group of attractive young Athenian aristocrats,
closely read, stirs one profoundly to a consideration of the nature of
good and evil, of reality, of the paramount mystery of the human
soul.” —<em>from the Introduction by Irwin Edman</em></p>

<p><em>Endpapers:</em> Pictorial endpapers by Kent headed: Chart of the entrance
to RESVRRECTION BAY, ALASKA, Kenai Peninsula. Photographically reduced
from the endpapers of the Putnam edition. <em>Wilderness</em> was the second ML
title to appear in balloon cloth binding C without Kent’s grapevine
design on the spine of the binding (see “Binding” in the introductory
matter to 1930 entries).</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper
depicting a man and boy looming above the horizon; borders in black,
lettering in deep reddish orange. Designed by Kent; unsigned. (<em>Fall
1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
More than a record of an adventure in solitude, <em>Wilderness</em> is a book
that re-creates the wonder and the tranquillity of an untracked world.
The hand and heart and mind of a distinguished artist combine, in
prose and pictures, to convey the topography and the moods, the
changing vistas and the dramatic silences of the sub-Arctic region.
Rockwell Kent’s text, embellished by more than fifty pictures from his
pen, has the excitement of a quest that attains the nearest paradise
man can hope for on earth. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1920, in a volume measuring
approximately 11½ x 8 in. (280 x 200 mm). ML edition printed from plates
made from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the
original introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second
Preface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. [v] of the Putnam
edition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in
the volume. Published December 1930. <em>WR</em> 27 December 1930. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.</p>
<p>The Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The
announcement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition,
Rockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important
revisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations
that appear in the six dollar edition” (<em>PW</em> 118, 16 August 1930, p.
574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored
“two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in
the fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently
would not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go
so quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear
under the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Guter Mond, du gehst so stille</p>
<p>Durch die Abend Wolken hin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s
smaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the
Putnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by
about a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all
of the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the
title page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam
binding.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to
Angus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint
rights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized $1.49 reprint
published by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was
planning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not
consulted about the $1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of
the ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2
June 1939). Kent bought 240 copies of the discontinued ML edition at
twenty-five cents each (Kent to Cerf, 8 June 1939).</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis’s long essay on Huysmans, used as an introduction to the
ML edition of <em>Against the Grain</em>, is reprinted from his second
collection of biographical essays, <em>Affirmations</em> (London: Walter Scott,
1898). The ML had previously added the essay to its edition of Ellis’s

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1930\n\n## 1930\n\n### General\n\nThe Modern Library’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City\nPublishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in\nhard-cover reprints, was announced on 4 April. The Sun Dial Library had\nbeen in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary\nworks similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it\nincluded fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun\nDial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American\nseries that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf\nregarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April\n1930).\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library gave the Modern Library access to a\nnumber of titles that Cerf and Klopfer had tried to secure from\nDoubleday in the past. The series included major works by Joseph Conrad,\nAldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, William McFee, and Christopher\nMorley, all of whom were Doubleday authors. Other desirable titles in\nthe series included Katherine Mansfield’s *Garden Party*, Bram Stoker’s\n*Dracula*, and H. G. Wells’s *Tono-Bungay*.\n\nAs part of the agreement the Modern Library secured reprint rights to\nfour Doubleday titles—Arnold Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Aldous\nHuxley’s *Point Counter Point*, W. Somerset Maugham’s *Of Human\nBondage*, and Horace Walpole’s *Fortitude*—that were not part of the Sun\nDial Library. Cerf and Klopfer had been trying to secure reprint rights\nto these titles for several years. The Modern Library agreed to pay\nDoubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy for these four titles—two\ncents more than Cerf and Klopfer were then paying for any other book in\nthe ML with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men* (159). The four\ntitles were added to the Modern Library between September 1930 and\nJanuary 1931.\n\nEleven of the 53 titles in the Sun Dial Library were added to the ML\nbetween 1931 and 1937: Conrad, *Lord Jim* (210); Mansfield, *The Garden\nParty* (214); Morley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (213); McFee, *Casuals of\nthe Sea* (223); Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225); Stoker, *Dracula* (231);\nConrad, *Victory* (238); Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (248); Huxley,\n*Antic Hay* (233); Maugham, *Moon and Sixpence* (283); and Collins, *The\nMoonstone* (G31). All of these except *The Moonstone* appear to have\nbeen protected by copyright and could not have been included in the ML\nwithout the permission of Doubleday, Doran.\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library was a straight cash transaction.\nThe Modern Library acquired the entire stock of Sun Dial Library books,\nabout 87,000 volumes, and got the right for five years to add any title\nfrom the series for which Doubleday, Doran controlled the copyright. No\nplates were involved since Garden City Publishing Co., like other\nreprint publishers, printed from the original publishers’ plates. The\ntotal cost was just under $25,000. This represented the exact\nmanufacturing cost of each volume, a royalty of ten cents a copy, and an\nadditional payment of $5,000.\n\nThe books were transferred to the Modern Library’s warehouse at the\nWolff Bindery in New York. Cerf estimated that no more than half of the\nbooks could be sold at full price. Cerf and Klopfer hoped at first to\nsell enough books at the regular price to enable them to remainder the\nrest at the end of the year and still break even (Cerf to Crowder, 10\nApril 1930). Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, the big New York department\nstores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them\nat sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to\n60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned\nthe idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan\nCo. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were\nbeing offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55\npercent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big\naccount in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but\nCerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J.\nSmalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931).\n\nOther ways were found to dispose of the weakest titles. Many of them\nwere bartered for Modern Library advertising in college newspapers, and\nseveral booksellers agreed to accept Sun Dial Library books as the\nModern Library’s contribution toward cooperative advertising. By\nSeptember 1933 the Sun Dial Library stock was almost gone.\n\nCerf commented to the ML’s senior sales representative, “Considering the\ngeneral depression, our Modern Library sales seem to be holding up\nwonderfully. The new picture jackets help, and the Fall additions should\ncause general satisfaction, I believe” (Cerf to Crowder, 11 July 1930).\n\nThe ML ordered new typesettings and plates for three of its most popular\ntitles: Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Bennett, *Old Wives Tale*\n(207), and Stoker, *Dracula* (231).\n\nErnest Hemingway paid tribute to the ML’s format in December 1930. He\nhad shattered his arm in a serious car accident in early November and\nwas recuperating in Key West after spending seven weeks in a Billings,\nMontana hospital. In a letter to Cerf typed by his wife Pauline he\ngratefully described Modern Library books as “the proper size for\none-handed reading” (Hemingway to Cerf, 26 December 1930).\n\n### Number of titles\n\nNineteen titles were added and four were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of active titles to 182. Minor discrepancies between the number\nof titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due\nprimarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January\npublication on fall lists. Fall 1930 jackets also list Merejkowski,\n\n*Peter and Alexis* (227), which was originally announced for August 1930\nbut was delayed until December 1931.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages\non each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32\npages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side\nof the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nExcept for Rockwell Kent’s *Wilderness* (205) all new titles had the\nfinal version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face\ntype and torchbearer A2, A3, or C1 (see individual entries).\n*Wilderness* had an individually designed title page featuring an\nillustration by Kent; torchbearer B appears on the verso of the title\npage.\n\n### Binding\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published in all four bindings.\nSee the illustration of Huysmans, *Against the Grain*, which shows four\ncopies of the fall 1930 first printing, each in a binding of a different\ncolor.\n\nRockwell Kent’s B1 binding with the grape vine design at the base of the\nspine and his torchbearer stamped in gold on the front panel was used in\nits full form through spring 1930. The additional gold required for the\nB1 binding increased the ML’s costs by half a cent per volume, and the\nbinding was discontinued after a single season.\n\nThe balloon cloth B2 binding was used for the first seven titles\npublished in fall 1930. The B2 binding is identical to B1 except for the\ntorchbearer, which is blind stamped on the front panel. Titles published\ninitially in the B2 binding are Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (197), Mencken,\n*Selected Prejudices* (198), Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Goethe,\n*Faust* (200), Walpole, *Fortitude* (201), Young, *The Medici* (202),\nand Huxley, *Point Counter Point* (203).\n\nBalloon cloth binding C replaced Kent’s original design for the last\nthree titles published in 1930: Plato, *Works* (204), Kent, *Wilderness*\n(205), and Huysmans, *Against the Grain* (206). Kent’s grape vine design\nis omitted from the spine, but his torchbearer, reduced in size from 36\nto 27 mm, is again stamped in gold on the front panel. Balloon cloth\nbinding C was used through April 1931 and was superseded by balloon\ncloth binding D in May 1931.\n\nEarly in 1930 Klopfer asked H. Wolff, the ML’s bindery, to look into the\npotential savings of using imitation gold (“oriental tissue”) instead of\ngenuine gold on the bindings, noting that it would have to save at least\na penny per book to make the change worthwhile (Klopfer to Bert Wolff,\n23 January 1930). Wolff indicated that imitation gold would save .003\nper copy or $3.00 per thousand—a savings of $1,500–1,800 a year (Wolff\nto Klopfer, 20 January 1930). As a test Klopfer asked that the ML’s May\ntitle, *Oriental Romances* (196), be stamped in imitation gold. Wolff\nmistakenly used imitation gold on the ML’s entire current binding order\nof 118,404 volumes instead of genuine gold as specified in the contract\n(RH Box 766, Wolff folder). Balloon cloth binding B2 with the\ntorchbearer blind stamped on the front panel appears to have been the\nsolution to the problem.\n\n**Library Edition**\n\nTwenty-five ML titles were offered in special bindings for the library\nmarket. The flexible balloon cloth bindings used for volumes sold in\nstores did not withstand repeated readings and thus were not well suited\nto library use. Volumes in the “Library Edition” were bound in sturdy\nblue buckram over stiff boards with headbands at the head and foot of\nthe spine. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings in the regular ML, the\nbindings were reinforced with mull, also known as crash—a strip of\nsturdy starched fabric that was glued over the folded gatherings at the\nspine, with flaps extending about half an inch on each side that were\nglued to the inside of the front and back boards. The titles were:\n\n*American Poetry* *1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology*, ed. Aiken\n(169.1)\n\nBeebe, *Jungle Peace* (116)\n\n*Best Ghost Stories* (67)\n\n*Best Russian Short Stories*, ed. Seltzer (18)\n\nBrontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120)\n\nCarroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass,\nThe Hunting of the Snark* (111)\n\nCellini, *Autobiography* (132)\n\nDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (171)\n\nDouglas, *South Wind* (114)\n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed. Starrett (155)\n\nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (21)\n\nHardy, *Return of the Native* (126)\n\nHudson, *Green Mansions* (90)\n\nIbsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People* (6)\n\nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (128)\n\nMelville, *Moby Dick* (124)\n\nMeredith, *Diana of the Crossways* (14)\n\nMeredith, *Ordeal of Richard Feverel* (144)\n\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154)\n\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (9)\n\nSchreiner, *Story of an African Farm* (142)\n\nSterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158)\n\nSymonds, *Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti* (164)\n\nWilde, *Picture of Dorian Gray* (1)\n\nWilde, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*\n(76)\n\nFifteen of the titles were ones that Cerf and Klopfer added between fall\n1925 and 1928; ten had originally appeared in the Boni & Liveright\nseries. The attempt to market ML books to libraries was not a success,\nprobably because the small size of the volumes and the narrow margins\ndid not allow for rebinding.\n\nBuckram bindings for the library market were again made available for\nmany ML titles in the 1960s, more than twenty years after the ML\nintroduced its larger format. This time the optional buckram bindings\nappear to have been successful.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nRockwell Kent endpapers used in spring 1930 were available in three\ndifferent colors and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth\nbindings. Blue and green bindings continued to be paired with pale green\n(149) endpapers; brown bindings examined had light reddish brown (42)\nendpapers; and red bindings had endpapers in light orange (52).\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were in moderate orange (53).\nModerate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from\nfall 1930 through spring 1939, except for the oversize volume, John\nReed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935: 280) and three spring 1939\ntitles—Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317), Isak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic\nTales* (320), and *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTen of the 1930 titles were published in individually designed pictorial\njackets. Seven appeared in uniform typographic jacket D. Maugham, *Of\nHuman Bondage* (199) was published in uniform typographic jacket E;\nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (203) had a non-pictorial jacket designed\nby E. McKnight Kauffer.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Hemingway, *Sun Also Rises* xGoethe, *Faust*. (Fall) Goethe,\n*Faust* xConrad, *Lord Jim*.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf wanted to include John Galsworthy’s *Forsyte Saga* in the Modern\nLibrary but realized that Scribner’s was unlikely to grant reprint\nrights. He wrote Maxwell Perkins in 1930, “I eagerly await hearing of\nMr. Scribner’s reaction to my suggestion for the *Forsyte Saga*. I hope\nthat I did not move him to physical violence. I am convinced the idea is\nnot as ridiculous as it very likely appears at first blush” (Cerf to\nPerkins, 4 December 1930). Perkins replied that there was no possibility\nof granting reprint rights (Perkins to Cerf, 4 December 1930). Nine\nyears later Cerf offered an advance of $7,500 to publish *The Forsyte\nSaga* as a Giant (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939). Galsworthy’s\nsequence of three novels and two interludes never appeared in the ML.\n\nCerf contacted John W. Luce & Co. about rights to a John Millington\nSynge anthology (Cerf to Mr. Schaff, 23 June 1930). Cerf contacted\nLongman’s for the rights to H. Rider Haggard’s *She*, J. C. Van Dyke’s\n*History of Painting*, and G. F. Young’s history from 44 B.C. to 1453\nA.D., *East and West through Fifteen Centuries* (Cerf to J. Ray Beck, 25\nSeptember 1930). The only one of these titles that was ever added to the\nML was *She*—and that was over 25 years later, when Haggard’s *She &\nKing Solomon’s Mines* (492) appeared in the ML in 1957.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Goethe’s *Faust* and *The Sayings of Confucius* (Crowder to\nCerf, 12 April 1930 and 30 September 1930). *Faust* (200) was published\nin the ML that fall. *The Wisdom of Confucius* (312) appeared in the ML\nin 1938 and became one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. V. F.\nCalverton, who edited *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183)\nfor the ML in 1929, offered to edit *Tales of E. T. A. Hoffman* for the\nseries; Cerf indicated that the book was a possibility in the future\n(Cerf to Calverton, 10 December 1930).\n\nThe ML decided not to publish Guillaume Apollinaire’s *La Rome des\nBorgia* after a reader’s report judged it pornographic and valueless as\nhistory. The reader commented, “The whole simply stinks of obscenity and\nabnormality” (“Ray” to Klopfer, 18 February 1930).\n\nFerris Greenslet urged Cerf to publish a ML edition of Alain-Fournier’s\nnovel *The Wanderer* (*Le Grand Meaulnes*), which was originally\npublished in Paris in 1913 and appeared in an English translation\npublished by Houghton Mifflin in 1928, fourteen years after the young\nauthor’s death in action in the First World War. “I hope very much that\nyou are going to feel like doing something about THE WANDERER, both\nbecause we would like the business and because I personally have a\nprofound interest in extending the reputation of Alain Fournier”\n(Greenslet to Cerf, 5 September 1930). Cerf appears to have been\nskeptical about its sales potential. Roger L. Scaife, who would move\nfrom Houghton Mifflin to Little, Brown & Co. a short time later, replied\nto Cerf: “You may be right about THE WANDERER. The story took hold of us\nhere so strongly that we thought it a gem that should be preserved and\nsold year after year. Whether that is possible or not, I do not know.\nYour judgment is understandably better than mine in this case” (Scaife\nto Cerf, 6 October 1930). A new English translation by Frank Davison was\npublished in 1959 under the title *The Lost Domain* by Oxford University\nPress in its World’s Classics series and reprinted in Penguin Modern\nClassics as *Le Grand Meaulnes* in 1966. A third English translation by\nRobin Buss appeared in Penguin Classics in 2007 under the title *The\nLost Estate*.\n\nThe Marxist poet and novelist Isidor Schneider, who was in charge of\nadvertising at Horace Liveright, Inc., and whose wife, Helen Berlin, had\nbeen Cerf and Klopfer’s first secretary, recommended Ivan Goncharov’s\n*Oblomov* for the ML. The Natalie Duddington translation, published by\nMacmillan the previous year, was the first complete translation in\nEnglish. Schneider, who later served as literary editor of the *New\nMasses*, considered *Oblomov* one of the world’s ten best novels\n(Schneider to Cerf, 1 April 1930; Schneider Special Manuscript\nCollection, Columbia University Library). The Duddington translation was\npublished in Everyman’s Library in 1932, but *Oblomov* was never added\nin the ML.\n\n### New titles\n\nOverton, ed., *Great Modern Short Stories* (1930) 188\n\nJames, *Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* (1930) 189\n\nHemingway, *Sun Also Rises* (1930) 190\n\nTolstoy, *Anna Karenina* (1930) 191\n\nHuneker, *Painted Veils* (1930) 192\n\nTchekov, *Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930) 193\n\nProust, *Within a Budding Grove* (1930) 194\n\nDewey, *Human Nature and Conduct* (1930) 195\n\nKomroff, ed., *Oriental Romances* (1930) 196\n\nCervantes, *Don Quixote* (1930) 197\n\nMencken, *Selected Prejudices* (1930) 198\n\nMaugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930) 199\n\nGoethe, *Faust* (1930) 200\n\nWalpole, *Fortitude* (1930) 201\n\nYoung, *Medici* (1930) 202\n\nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (1930) 203\n\nPlato, *Works of Plato* (1930) 204\n\nKent, *Wilderness* (1930) 205\n\nHuysmans, *Against the Grain* (1930) 206### Discontinued\n\nDunsany, *Book of Wonder* (1918) 42\n\n*Evolution in Modern Thought* (1918) 35\n\nFabre, *Life of the Caterpillar* (1925) 115\n\nWilson, *Selected Addresses and Public Papers* (1918) 63\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 188\n\n**GRANT OVERTON, ed.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by the Macmillan Co., 1898 (*The Turn of the\nScrew*) and 1892 (*The Lesson of the Master*). ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for January\n1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nThe ML’s original intent was to publish *The Turn of the Screw* only, to\nprint from Macmillan plates, and to pay a $1,000 advance against\nroyalties of 8 cents a copy (H. C. Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26\nNovember 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to\nwrite an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March\n1929).\n\nFinal publication plans took shape in January 1930, when Macmillan\ngranted permission to add *The Lesson of the Master* for an additional\npayment of $100 (Latham to ML, 10 January 1930). Broun’s introduction,\ndated January 1930, makes no reference to *The Lesson of the Master*.\nThe ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed\npublication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both\nworks entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying\nroyalties of 2 cents a copy.\n\n*The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* ranked in the third\nquarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May\n1942–October 1943, just below *The Portrait of a Lady* (291). James’s\nsales improved significantly by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952 *The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of\nthe Master* sold 3,734 copies, making it seventy-fourth of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.

(*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xi\\]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930. *WR*\n8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as\n1927, when he offered a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New\nYork Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was\npleased that *The Sun Also Rises* was to appear in the series. But he\ndeclined Cerf’s offer of $200 to write an introduction—four times what\nF. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*—explaining that he couldn’t write an\nintroduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to\nwrite it would be taking $200 out of some critics \\[*sic*\\] pocket—but\nbeside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to\nCerf, 4 January 1930).\n\nPrintings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930),\n5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies\n(December 1934). *The Sun Also Rises* was the eighteenth best-selling ML\ntitle during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file).\nIt sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.\nIt sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML.\n\nCuriously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition of *The Sun Also Rises*,\ndespite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and\nUnabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being\nJewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he\nlearned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he\nhad felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the\nthird paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of\none of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the\nrichest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter\nXVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out\nbadly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three\nHemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29\nOctober 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *The Sun Also\nRises* would be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nreprint in April 1953 and a $1.45 paperback in August 1957.\n\n#### 190b.

As a man, he represents the best of\n> nineteenth-century humanitarianism and a generous Christian morality.\n> As a writer, he towers above all the literary figures of his time, and\n> his two great novels—*War and Peace* (Modern Library Giant G-1) and\n> *Anna Karenina*—are universally acclaimed as classics. Anna of the\n> latter novel is considered the most notable character in the vast\n> gallery of the great and obscure people who live in the pages of his\n> works. The translation from the Russian by Constance Garnett is\n> complete and unabridged. (*Fall 1952*)\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.\nSeveral authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat\naccepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale\nUniversity. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed,\n“Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of\nAnna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs.\nKarenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28\nJanuary 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that\nwere corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to\nextend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek\nwas willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance\nagainst a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart\nfor his introduction to Gogol’s *Dead Souls*. Stein indicated that $200\nwas all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to\nStein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon\nCollege and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell\nUniversity, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an\nintroduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in\nany case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March\n1950).\n\nTroyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s $200 fee (Troyat to\nStein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J.\nRobert Loy of Columbia University.\n\n### 191.2.

First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1942.\n\nThe ML paid Liveright a $5,000 advance. *Painted Veils* was the ML’s\nbest-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises*\n(190) and Merejkowski’s *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154). It\ncontinued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty\nbest-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117,\nPublicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in\nSeptember 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML\nprintings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.\n\nShortly after *Painted Veils* was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith,\nthe editor-in-chief of Boni & Liveright, suggested a ML edition of\nHuneker’s autobiography *Steeplejack* (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930).\nCerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you\nreally think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no\nquestion that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to\nSmith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles\nScribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker\ntitles it published, such as *Essays*, selected and introduced by H. L.\nMencken (1929) or *Steeplejack*. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s\nglory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern\nLibrary (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936).\nThe ML edition of *Painted Veils* was discontinued six years later.\n\n#### 192b.

Published April 1930. *WR* not found. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.\n\nCerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an\nadvance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot\nHolt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a\ncollege text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E.\nHolt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when\nHerschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a\nreorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince\nthe new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John\nDewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a\ncopy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first\npayment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that\nover for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13\nFebruary 1928).\n\nBy 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told\nCerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to\nCerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and\nsuggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to *The Dance of Life*\n(1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to\nwrite the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey\nto Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to\nthe ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense.\nDewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library\nEdition” since *Human Nature and Conduct* already included a preface and\nan introduction by Dewey.\n\nSomeone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his\nintroduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was\npaginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part\nof the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the\nmistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the\nlast page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on\nits verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing.\nIn its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8\nleaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all\nremaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first\nprinting. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of\nthe contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and\nthe first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of\nthe second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected\ncopies became the first state of the first printing.\n\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third\nprinting of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine\nprintings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A\nprinting of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper\nrationing.\n\n*Human Nature and Conduct* was low in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It\nranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period\nNovember 1952–October 1953.\n\n**195.1a**<sub>2</sub>**.

(*Fall\n1939*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1915, and from 1927\nby Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\]–766) printed from\nDoubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. Published September\n1930. *WR* 18 October 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies.\n\nCerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four\nlong-sought Doubleday titles—*Of Human Bondage*, Walpole’s *Fortitude*\n(201), Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203), and Bennett’s *Old Wives’\nTale* (207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden\nCity Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a\n$6,000 advance for *Of Human Bondage* and agreed to pay royalties of 12\ncents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was\nthen paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men*\n(159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January\n1931. Doubleday’s new plates *Of Human Bondage* were originally intended\nfor the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden\nCity Publishing Co. around 1933.\n\nIn April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent\nof the list price, which was then $2.45. Royalties on the Vintage\npaperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a\n$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the\ntotal was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of $10,000 due on1\nJanuary 1969 and 1 January 1970.\n\nIn 1968 the ML considered transferring *Of Human Bondage* to the Giants\nseries, which would have involved photographing the book and making new\nplates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.\n\n*Of Human Bondage* was one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It\nranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication\ndate, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH\nbox 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in\n1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as\nfollows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and\n11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not\ncalendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been\nsold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf\nto Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the\n18-month period May 1942–October 1943 *Of Human Bondage* sold 18,505\ncopies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the\nfourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more\ncopies than Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228), then the second\nbest-selling title in the regular series. By the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s best-selling title with sales\nof 11,563 copies.\n\n#### 199.1b.

(*Fall 1957*)\n\nThe plates for *Of Human Bondage* and Maugham’s *Moon and Sixpence*\n(283) were becoming worn by 1944 and Haas decided to make new plates for\nboth titles. Freiman contacted Doubleday, Doran to determine whether it\nwas willing to supply new plates or at least pay part of the cost\n(Freiman memo to Haas, 13 November 1944). Doubleday, Doran agreed to\nreset and make new plates for both titles at its own expense as long as\nthe ML agreed to keep them in print and promote them aggressively for at\nleast ten years (Cedric R. Crowell, Doubleday, Doran, to Commins, 2\nJanuary 1945). The new plates were delivered to the ML’s printers in\nDecember 1945. The ML instructed Parkway Printing Co. to dispose of the\nold plates and use the new ones for all future printings (Regina Spirito\nto Bill Simon, Parkway Printing, 13 December 1945).\n\n#### 199.3a.

The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of\n12 cents a copy. Cerf told the press agent Lynn Farnol that Walpole\nreceived the highest advance against royalties that the ML had ever paid\n(Cerf to Farnol, 14 May 1941), but the amount was not indicated—and of\ncourse the advance would have been paid to Doubleday, Doran, which would\nhave split it with Walpole.\n\nCerf was unhappy with the appearance of the first printing. The plates,\nhe told Doubleday, “are lousy, and we need some new ones” (Cerf to\nRobert de Graff, Garden City Pub. Co., 5 November 1930). When he sent a\ncopy of the first printing to Walpole he apologized for its appearance\nand indicated that Doubleday had promised to supply new plates for\nsubsequent printings (Cerf to Walpole, 26 November 1930).\n\n*Fortitude* was in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943.

Garden City was\nplanning to publish *The Medici* under its Star Dollar Books imprint\n(Cerf to Robert de Graff, Garden City, 30 December 1930). No evidence of\na printing in Star Dollar Books or any other Doubleday imprint has been\nfound.\n\nCharles Boni used the ML plates in 1930 for a single printing of *The\nMedici* in the format the ML would adopt the following year for the new\nML Giants series. Later that year Cerf and Klopfer bought the remaining\nstock from A. & C.

ML edition\nprinted from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting that\nappears to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published November\n1930. *WR* 29 November 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued\n1967.\n\n*Point Counter Point* was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML\nsecured reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library\nfrom Garden City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran\na $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Most ML royalties\nwere based on the number of copies printed; the royalties for *Point\nCounter Point* were based on sales.\n\nThere was a second printing of 5,000 copies in August 1931 and a third\nprinting of 4,000 copies in November 1932. *Point Counter Point* was low\nin the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943. Sales improved significantly by the early\n1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 *Point\nCounter Point* was the 27th best-selling title in the ML.\n\nIn 1939 Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and the publishing rights to\nHuxley’s older books to Harper & Bros. Cerf expressed the hope that\n*Point Counter Point* and *Antic Hay* could remain in the ML “for a long\ntime to come” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939).\nHarper’s considered publishing the titles in full-priced editions at\n$2.50 and was concerned about the income it could expect from the ML\neditions. Unless the income was substantial, Hoyns indicated, the ML\neditions “might turn out to be a very unprofitable arrangement from our\npoint of view” (Hoyns to Klopfer, 17 March 1939).\n\nKlopfer and Hoyns met over lunch to discuss the matter. Shortly before\nthe meeting Klopfer wrote directly to Huxley, who was a personal friend:\n“Help, help, Harper’s are threatening to take POINT COUNTER POINT and\nANTIC HAY away from us. These two books belong in the Modern Library and\nit would be a crime not to have them available in a cheaper\nedition. . . . Could you influence the Harper office in any way in our\nfavor? I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can\nmake a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a\nstrong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive\nreprint, rather than just in the $2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to\nHuxley, 20 March 1939).\n\nKlopfer’s appeal appears to have been successful. Following the lunch\nKlopfer sent Hoyns new five-year contracts for the books. The *Point\nCounter Point* contract called for the ML to pay a $1,200 advance\nagainst royalties of 12 cents a copy and included a special clause that\nallowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a\nreprint of at least 5,000 copies after three years.\n\nIn 1965 Harper & Row gave six months’ notice that the ML contract was\nbeing terminated so that *Point Counter Point* could be included in its\nown hardbound series, Perennial Classics (Virginia Olson, Harper & Row,\nto Epstein, 23 July 1965). The ML was allowed to sell out its stock on\nhand, which consisted of 4,400 copies (Epstein to Olson, 9 August 1965).\nThe ML edition was out of stock by summer 1967.\n\n#### 203b.

Fourteen dialogues\nwere omitted.

ML edition printed from plates\nmade from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the\noriginal introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second\nPreface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. \\[v\\] of the Putnam\nedition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in\nthe volume. Published December 1930. *WR* 27 December 1930. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.\n\nThe Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The\nannouncement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition,\nRockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important\nrevisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations\nthat appear in the six dollar edition” (*PW* 118, 16 August 1930, p.\n574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored\n“two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in\nthe fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently\nwould not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go\nso quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear\nunder the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:\n\n> “Guter Mond, du gehst so stille\n>\n> Durch die Abend Wolken hin.”\n\nThe ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s\nsmaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the\nPutnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by\nabout a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all\nof the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the\ntitle page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam\nbinding.\n\nThe ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to\nAngus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint\nrights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized $1.49 reprint\npublished by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was\nplanning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not\nconsulted about the $1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of\nthe ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2\nJune 1939).

  "general": "The Modern Library’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City\nPublishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in\nhard-cover reprints, was announced on 4 April. The Sun Dial Library had\nbeen in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary\nworks similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it\nincluded fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun\nDial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American\nseries that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf\nregarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April\n1930).\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library gave the Modern Library access to a\nnumber of titles that Cerf and Klopfer had tried to secure from\nDoubleday in the past. The series included major works by Joseph Conrad,\nAldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, William McFee, and Christopher\nMorley, all of whom were Doubleday authors. Other desirable titles in\nthe series included Katherine Mansfield’s *Garden Party*, Bram Stoker’s\n*Dracula*, and H. G. Wells’s *Tono-Bungay*.\n\nAs part of the agreement the Modern Library secured reprint rights to\nfour Doubleday titles—Arnold Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Aldous\nHuxley’s *Point Counter Point*, W. Somerset Maugham’s *Of Human\nBondage*, and Horace Walpole’s *Fortitude*—that were not part of the Sun\nDial Library. Cerf and Klopfer had been trying to secure reprint rights\nto these titles for several years. The Modern Library agreed to pay\nDoubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy for these four titles—two\ncents more than Cerf and Klopfer were then paying for any other book in\nthe ML with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men* (159). The four\ntitles were added to the Modern Library between September 1930 and\nJanuary 1931.\n\nEleven of the 53 titles in the Sun Dial Library were added to the ML\nbetween 1931 and 1937: Conrad, *Lord Jim* (210); Mansfield, *The Garden\nParty* (214); Morley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (213); McFee, *Casuals of\nthe Sea* (223); Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225); Stoker, *Dracula* (231);\nConrad, *Victory* (238); Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (248); Huxley,\n*Antic Hay* (233); Maugham, *Moon and Sixpence* (283); and Collins, *The\nMoonstone* (G31). All of these except *The Moonstone* appear to have\nbeen protected by copyright and could not have been included in the ML\nwithout the permission of Doubleday, Doran.\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library was a straight cash transaction.\nThe Modern Library acquired the entire stock of Sun Dial Library books,\nabout 87,000 volumes, and got the right for five years to add any title\nfrom the series for which Doubleday, Doran controlled the copyright. No\nplates were involved since Garden City Publishing Co., like other\nreprint publishers, printed from the original publishers’ plates. The\ntotal cost was just under $25,000. This represented the exact\nmanufacturing cost of each volume, a royalty of ten cents a copy, and an\nadditional payment of $5,000.\n\nThe books were transferred to the Modern Library’s warehouse at the\nWolff Bindery in New York. Cerf estimated that no more than half of the\nbooks could be sold at full price. Cerf and Klopfer hoped at first to\nsell enough books at the regular price to enable them to remainder the\nrest at the end of the year and still break even (Cerf to Crowder, 10\nApril 1930). Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, the big New York department\nstores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them\nat sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to\n60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned\nthe idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan\nCo. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were\nbeing offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55\npercent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big\naccount in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but\nCerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J.\nSmalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931).\n\nOther ways were found to dispose of the weakest titles. Many of them\nwere bartered for Modern Library advertising in college newspapers, and\nseveral booksellers agreed to accept Sun Dial Library books as the\nModern Library’s contribution toward cooperative advertising. By\nSeptember 1933 the Sun Dial Library stock was almost gone.\n\nCerf commented to the ML’s senior sales representative, “Considering the\ngeneral depression, our Modern Library sales seem to be holding up\nwonderfully. The new picture jackets help, and the Fall additions should\ncause general satisfaction, I believe” (Cerf to Crowder, 11 July 1930).\n\nThe ML ordered new typesettings and plates for three of its most popular\ntitles: Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Bennett, *Old Wives Tale*\n(207), and Stoker, *Dracula* (231).\n\nErnest Hemingway paid tribute to the ML’s format in December 1930. He\nhad shattered his arm in a serious car accident in early November and\nwas recuperating in Key West after spending seven weeks in a Billings,\nMontana hospital. In a letter to Cerf typed by his wife Pauline he\ngratefully described Modern Library books as “the proper size for\none-handed reading” (Hemingway to Cerf, 26 December 1930).",
  "numberOfTitles": "Nineteen titles were added and four were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of active titles to 182. Minor discrepancies between the number\nof titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due\nprimarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January\npublication on fall lists. Fall 1930 jackets also list Merejkowski,\n\n*Peter and Alexis* (227), which was originally announced for August 1930\nbut was delayed until December 1931.",
  "format": "All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages\non each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32\npages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side\nof the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).",
  "titlePage": "Except for Rockwell Kent’s *Wilderness* (205) all new titles had the\nfinal version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face\ntype and torchbearer A2, A3, or C1 (see individual entries).\n*Wilderness* had an individually designed title page featuring an\nillustration by Kent; torchbearer B appears on the verso of the title\npage.",
  "binding": "Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published in all four bindings.\nSee the illustration of Huysmans, *Against the Grain*, which shows four\ncopies of the fall 1930 first printing, each in a binding of a different\ncolor.\n\nRockwell Kent’s B1 binding with the grape vine design at the base of the\nspine and his torchbearer stamped in gold on the front panel was used in\nits full form through spring 1930. The additional gold required for the\nB1 binding increased the ML’s costs by half a cent per volume, and the\nbinding was discontinued after a single season.\n\nThe balloon cloth B2 binding was used for the first seven titles\npublished in fall 1930. The B2 binding is identical to B1 except for the\ntorchbearer, which is blind stamped on the front panel. Titles published\ninitially in the B2 binding are Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (197), Mencken,\n*Selected Prejudices* (198), Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Goethe,\n*Faust* (200), Walpole, *Fortitude* (201), Young, *The Medici* (202),\nand Huxley, *Point Counter Point* (203).\n\nBalloon cloth binding C replaced Kent’s original design for the last\nthree titles published in 1930: Plato, *Works* (204), Kent, *Wilderness*\n(205), and Huysmans, *Against the Grain* (206). Kent’s grape vine design\nis omitted from the spine, but his torchbearer, reduced in size from 36\nto 27 mm, is again stamped in gold on the front panel. Balloon cloth\nbinding C was used through April 1931 and was superseded by balloon\ncloth binding D in May 1931.\n\nEarly in 1930 Klopfer asked H. Wolff, the ML’s bindery, to look into the\npotential savings of using imitation gold (“oriental tissue”) instead of\ngenuine gold on the bindings, noting that it would have to save at least\na penny per book to make the change worthwhile (Klopfer to Bert Wolff,\n23 January 1930). Wolff indicated that imitation gold would save .003\nper copy or $3.00 per thousand—a savings of $1,500–1,800 a year (Wolff\nto Klopfer, 20 January 1930). As a test Klopfer asked that the ML’s May\ntitle, *Oriental Romances* (196), be stamped in imitation gold. Wolff\nmistakenly used imitation gold on the ML’s entire current binding order\nof 118,404 volumes instead of genuine gold as specified in the contract\n(RH Box 766, Wolff folder). Balloon cloth binding B2 with the\ntorchbearer blind stamped on the front panel appears to have been the\nsolution to the problem.\n\n**Library Edition**\n\nTwenty-five ML titles were offered in special bindings for the library\nmarket. The flexible balloon cloth bindings used for volumes sold in\nstores did not withstand repeated readings and thus were not well suited\nto library use. Volumes in the “Library Edition” were bound in sturdy\nblue buckram over stiff boards with headbands at the head and foot of\nthe spine. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings in the regular ML, the\nbindings were reinforced with mull, also known as crash—a strip of\nsturdy starched fabric that was glued over the folded gatherings at the\nspine, with flaps extending about half an inch on each side that were\nglued to the inside of the front and back boards. The titles were:\n\n*American Poetry* *1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology*, ed. Aiken\n(169.1)\n\nBeebe, *Jungle Peace* (116)\n\n*Best Ghost Stories* (67)\n\n*Best Russian Short Stories*, ed. Seltzer (18)\n\nBrontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120)\n\nCarroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass,\nThe Hunting of the Snark* (111)\n\nCellini, *Autobiography* (132)\n\nDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (171)\n\nDouglas, *South Wind* (114)\n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed. Starrett (155)\n\nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (21)\n\nHardy, *Return of the Native* (126)\n\nHudson, *Green Mansions* (90)\n\nIbsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People* (6)\n\nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (128)\n\nMelville, *Moby Dick* (124)\n\nMeredith, *Diana of the Crossways* (14)\n\nMeredith, *Ordeal of Richard Feverel* (144)\n\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154)\n\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (9)\n\nSchreiner, *Story of an African Farm* (142)\n\nSterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158)\n\nSymonds, *Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti* (164)\n\nWilde, *Picture of Dorian Gray* (1)\n\nWilde, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*\n(76)\n\nFifteen of the titles were ones that Cerf and Klopfer added between fall\n1925 and 1928; ten had originally appeared in the Boni & Liveright\nseries. The attempt to market ML books to libraries was not a success,\nprobably because the small size of the volumes and the narrow margins\ndid not allow for rebinding.\n\nBuckram bindings for the library market were again made available for\nmany ML titles in the 1960s, more than twenty years after the ML\nintroduced its larger format. This time the optional buckram bindings\nappear to have been successful.",
  "endpaper": "Rockwell Kent endpapers used in spring 1930 were available in three\ndifferent colors and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth\nbindings. Blue and green bindings continued to be paired with pale green\n(149) endpapers; brown bindings examined had light reddish brown (42)\nendpapers; and red bindings had endpapers in light orange (52).\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were in moderate orange (53).\nModerate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from\nfall 1930 through spring 1939, except for the oversize volume, John\nReed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935: 280) and three spring 1939\ntitles—Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317), Isak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic\nTales* (320), and *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTen of the 1930 titles were published in individually designed pictorial\njackets. Seven appeared in uniform typographic jacket D. Maugham, *Of\nHuman Bondage* (199) was published in uniform typographic jacket E;\nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (203) had a non-pictorial jacket designed\nby E. McKnight Kauffer.",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf wanted to include John Galsworthy’s *Forsyte Saga* in the Modern\nLibrary but realized that Scribner’s was unlikely to grant reprint\nrights. He wrote Maxwell Perkins in 1930, “I eagerly await hearing of\nMr. Scribner’s reaction to my suggestion for the *Forsyte Saga*. I hope\nthat I did not move him to physical violence. I am convinced the idea is\nnot as ridiculous as it very likely appears at first blush” (Cerf to\nPerkins, 4 December 1930). Perkins replied that there was no possibility\nof granting reprint rights (Perkins to Cerf, 4 December 1930). Nine\nyears later Cerf offered an advance of $7,500 to publish *The Forsyte\nSaga* as a Giant (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939). Galsworthy’s\nsequence of three novels and two interludes never appeared in the ML.\n\nCerf contacted John W. Luce & Co. about rights to a John Millington\nSynge anthology (Cerf to Mr. Schaff, 23 June 1930). Cerf contacted\nLongman’s for the rights to H. Rider Haggard’s *She*, J. C. Van Dyke’s\n*History of Painting*, and G. F. Young’s history from 44 B.C. to 1453\nA.D., *East and West through Fifteen Centuries* (Cerf to J. Ray Beck, 25\nSeptember 1930). The only one of these titles that was ever added to the\nML was *She*—and that was over 25 years later, when Haggard’s *She &\nKing Solomon’s Mines* (492) appeared in the ML in 1957.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Goethe’s *Faust* and *The Sayings of Confucius* (Crowder to\nCerf, 12 April 1930 and 30 September 1930). *Faust* (200) was published\nin the ML that fall. *The Wisdom of Confucius* (312) appeared in the ML\nin 1938 and became one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. V. F.\nCalverton, who edited *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183)\nfor the ML in 1929, offered to edit *Tales of E. T. A. Hoffman* for the\nseries; Cerf indicated that the book was a possibility in the future\n(Cerf to Calverton, 10 December 1930).\n\nThe ML decided not to publish Guillaume Apollinaire’s *La Rome des\nBorgia* after a reader’s report judged it pornographic and valueless as\nhistory. The reader commented, “The whole simply stinks of obscenity and\nabnormality” (“Ray” to Klopfer, 18 February 1930).\n\nFerris Greenslet urged Cerf to publish a ML edition of Alain-Fournier’s\nnovel *The Wanderer* (*Le Grand Meaulnes*), which was originally\npublished in Paris in 1913 and appeared in an English translation\npublished by Houghton Mifflin in 1928, fourteen years after the young\nauthor’s death in action in the First World War. “I hope very much that\nyou are going to feel like doing something about THE WANDERER, both\nbecause we would like the business and because I personally have a\nprofound interest in extending the reputation of Alain Fournier”\n(Greenslet to Cerf, 5 September 1930). Cerf appears to have been\nskeptical about its sales potential. Roger L. Scaife, who would move\nfrom Houghton Mifflin to Little, Brown & Co. a short time later, replied\nto Cerf: “You may be right about THE WANDERER. The story took hold of us\nhere so strongly that we thought it a gem that should be preserved and\nsold year after year. Whether that is possible or not, I do not know.\nYour judgment is understandably better than mine in this case” (Scaife\nto Cerf, 6 October 1930). A new English translation by Frank Davison was\npublished in 1959 under the title *The Lost Domain* by Oxford University\nPress in its World’s Classics series and reprinted in Penguin Modern\nClassics as *Le Grand Meaulnes* in 1966. A third English translation by\nRobin Buss appeared in Penguin Classics in 2007 under the title *The\nLost Estate*.\n\nThe Marxist poet and novelist Isidor Schneider, who was in charge of\nadvertising at Horace Liveright, Inc., and whose wife, Helen Berlin, had\nbeen Cerf and Klopfer’s first secretary, recommended Ivan Goncharov’s\n*Oblomov* for the ML. The Natalie Duddington translation, published by\nMacmillan the previous year, was the first complete translation in\nEnglish. Schneider, who later served as literary editor of the *New\nMasses*, considered *Oblomov* one of the world’s ten best novels\n(Schneider to Cerf, 1 April 1930; Schneider Special Manuscript\nCollection, Columbia University Library). The Duddington translation was\npublished in Everyman’s Library in 1932, but *Oblomov* was never added\nin the ML.",

In 1930 it\nincluded fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun\nDial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American\nseries that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf\nregarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by the Macmillan Co., 1898 (*The Turn of the\nScrew*) and 1892 (*The Lesson of the Master*). ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for January\n1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nThe ML’s original intent was to publish *The Turn of the Screw* only, to\nprint from Macmillan plates, and to pay a $1,000 advance against\nroyalties of 8 cents a copy (H. C. Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26\nNovember 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to\nwrite an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March\n1929).\n\nFinal publication plans took shape in January 1930, when Macmillan\ngranted permission to add *The Lesson of the Master* for an additional\npayment of $100 (Latham to ML, 10 January 1930). Broun’s introduction,\ndated January 1930, makes no reference to *The Lesson of the Master*.\nThe ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed\npublication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both\nworks entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying\nroyalties of 2 cents a copy.\n\n*The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* ranked in the third\nquarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May\n1942–October 1943, just below *The Portrait of a Lady* (291).

During the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952 *The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of\nthe Master* sold 3,734 copies, making it seventy-fourth of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.

(*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Instead of beginning his career as a writer of promise, Ernest\n> Hemingway startled the world, and especially his own generation, with\n> *The Sun Also Rises*, his first full-length novel. The disinherited\n> and disillusioned survivors of the World War discovered in him their\n> spokesman, a writer free of sentimentality and cant who could summon\n> forth characters true to their own experience and way of life. *The\n> Sun Also Rises* is a chronicle of a lost generation drifting,\n> frustrated and demoralized, to its doom. (*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xi\\]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930. *WR*\n8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as\n1927, when he offered a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New\nYork Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was\npleased that *The Sun Also Rises* was to appear in the series. But he\ndeclined Cerf’s offer of $200 to write an introduction—four times what\nF. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*—explaining that he couldn’t write an\nintroduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to\nwrite it would be taking $200 out of some critics \\[*sic*\\] pocket—but\nbeside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to\nCerf, 4 January 1930).\n\nPrintings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930),\n5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies\n(December 1934). *The Sun Also Rises* was the eighteenth best-selling ML\ntitle during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file).\nIt sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.\nIt sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML.\n\nCuriously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition of *The Sun Also Rises*,\ndespite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and\nUnabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being\nJewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he\nlearned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he\nhad felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the\nthird paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of\none of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the\nrichest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter\nXVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out\nbadly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three\nHemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29\nOctober 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *The Sun Also\nRises* would be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nreprint in April 1953 and a $1.45 paperback in August 1957.\n\n#### 190b.

Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed,\n“Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of\nAnna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs.\nKarenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28\nJanuary 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that\nwere corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to\nextend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek\nwas willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance\nagainst a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart\nfor his introduction to Gogol’s *Dead Souls*. Stein indicated that $200\nwas all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to\nStein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon\nCollege and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell\nUniversity, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an\nintroduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in\nany case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March\n1950).\n\nTroyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s $200 fee (Troyat to\nStein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J.\nRobert Loy of Columbia University."

First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1942.\n\nThe ML paid Liveright a $5,000 advance. *Painted Veils* was the ML’s\nbest-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises*\n(190) and Merejkowski’s *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154). It\ncontinued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty\nbest-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117,\nPublicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in\nSeptember 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML\nprintings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.\n\nShortly after *Painted Veils* was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith,\nthe editor-in-chief of Boni & Liveright, suggested a ML edition of\nHuneker’s autobiography *Steeplejack* (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930).\nCerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you\nreally think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no\nquestion that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to\nSmith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles\nScribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker\ntitles it published, such as *Essays*, selected and introduced by H. L.\nMencken (1929) or *Steeplejack*. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s\nglory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern\nLibrary (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936).\nThe ML edition of *Painted Veils* was discontinued six years later.\n\n#### 192b.

(*Spring 1930*)\n\nOriginally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1922. ML edition\n(195.1a<sub>1</sub>, pp. \\[iii\\]–vii, 14–336) printed from corrected\nHolt plates with the introduction (pp. 1–13) omitted; 195.1a<sub>2</sub>\nand subsequent printings of 195.1 are printed from the same plates and\ninclude the introduction. Published April 1930. *WR* not found. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.\n\nCerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an\nadvance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot\nHolt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a\ncollege text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E.\nHolt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when\nHerschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a\nreorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince\nthe new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John\nDewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a\ncopy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first\npayment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that\nover for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13\nFebruary 1928).\n\nBy 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told\nCerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to\nCerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and\nsuggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to *The Dance of Life*\n(1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to\nwrite the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey\nto Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to\nthe ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense.\nDewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library\nEdition” since *Human Nature and Conduct* already included a preface and\nan introduction by Dewey.\n\nSomeone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his\nintroduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was\npaginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part\nof the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the\nmistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the\nlast page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on\nits verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing.\nIn its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8\nleaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all\nremaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first\nprinting. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of\nthe contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and\nthe first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of\nthe second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected\ncopies became the first state of the first printing.\n\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third\nprinting of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine\nprintings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A\nprinting of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper\nrationing.\n\n*Human Nature and Conduct* was low in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It\nranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period\nNovember 1952–October 1953.\n\n**195.1a**<sub>2</sub>**.

ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\]–766) printed from\nDoubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. Published September\n1930. *WR* 18 October 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies.\n\nCerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four\nlong-sought Doubleday titles—*Of Human Bondage*, Walpole’s *Fortitude*\n(201), Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203), and Bennett’s *Old Wives’\nTale* (207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden\nCity Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a\n$6,000 advance for *Of Human Bondage* and agreed to pay royalties of 12\ncents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was\nthen paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men*\n(159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January\n1931. Doubleday’s new plates *Of Human Bondage* were originally intended\nfor the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden\nCity Publishing Co. around 1933.\n\nIn April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent\nof the list price, which was then $2.45. Royalties on the Vintage\npaperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a\n$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the\ntotal was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of $10,000 due on1\nJanuary 1969 and 1 January 1970.\n\nIn 1968 the ML considered transferring *Of Human Bondage* to the Giants\nseries, which would have involved photographing the book and making new\nplates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.\n\n*Of Human Bondage* was one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It\nranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication\ndate, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH\nbox 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in\n1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as\nfollows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and\n11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not\ncalendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been\nsold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf\nto Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the\n18-month period May 1942–October 1943 *Of Human Bondage* sold 18,505\ncopies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the\nfourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more\ncopies than Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228), then the second\nbest-selling title in the regular series.

Garden City was\nplanning to publish *The Medici* under its Star Dollar Books imprint\n(Cerf to Robert de Graff, Garden City, 30 December 1930). No evidence of\na printing in Star Dollar Books or any other Doubleday imprint has been\nfound.\n\nCharles Boni used the ML plates in 1930 for a single printing of *The\nMedici* in the format the ML would adopt the following year for the new\nML Giants series. Later that year Cerf and Klopfer bought the remaining\nstock from A. & C. Boni and sold it along with a printing of *The\nEducation of Henry Adams* that they had produced in a similar format.\nThe books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to\ndepartment stores as dollar “specials.”\n\nAn illustrated edition of *The Medici* (G8), printed from plates of the\nregular ML edition, was published in ML Giants, 1933–49.\n\n*The Medici* was one of several titles that were omitted from a\ncomprehensive ranking of ML sales for the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943.

ML edition\nprinted from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting that\nappears to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published November\n1930. *WR* 29 November 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued\n1967.\n\n*Point Counter Point* was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML\nsecured reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library\nfrom Garden City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran\na $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Most ML royalties\nwere based on the number of copies printed; the royalties for *Point\nCounter Point* were based on sales.\n\nThere was a second printing of 5,000 copies in August 1931 and a third\nprinting of 4,000 copies in November 1932. *Point Counter Point* was low\nin the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943. Sales improved significantly by the early\n1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 *Point\nCounter Point* was the 27th best-selling title in the ML.\n\nIn 1939 Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and the publishing rights to\nHuxley’s older books to Harper & Bros. Cerf expressed the hope that\n*Point Counter Point* and *Antic Hay* could remain in the ML “for a long\ntime to come” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939).\nHarper’s considered publishing the titles in full-priced editions at\n$2.50 and was concerned about the income it could expect from the ML\neditions. Unless the income was substantial, Hoyns indicated, the ML\neditions “might turn out to be a very unprofitable arrangement from our\npoint of view” (Hoyns to Klopfer, 17 March 1939).\n\nKlopfer and Hoyns met over lunch to discuss the matter. Shortly before\nthe meeting Klopfer wrote directly to Huxley, who was a personal friend:\n“Help, help, Harper’s are threatening to take POINT COUNTER POINT and\nANTIC HAY away from us. These two books belong in the Modern Library and\nit would be a crime not to have them available in a cheaper\nedition. . . . Could you influence the Harper office in any way in our\nfavor? I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can\nmake a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a\nstrong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive\nreprint, rather than just in the $2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to\nHuxley, 20 March 1939).\n\nKlopfer’s appeal appears to have been successful. Following the lunch\nKlopfer sent Hoyns new five-year contracts for the books. The *Point\nCounter Point* contract called for the ML to pay a $1,200 advance\nagainst royalties of 12 cents a copy and included a special clause that\nallowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a\nreprint of at least 5,000 copies after three years.\n\nIn 1965 Harper & Row gave six months’ notice that the ML contract was\nbeing terminated so that *Point Counter Point* could be included in its\nown hardbound series, Perennial Classics (Virginia Olson, Harper & Row,\nto Epstein, 23 July 1965). The ML was allowed to sell out its stock on\nhand, which consisted of 4,400 copies (Epstein to Olson, 9 August 1965).\nThe ML edition was out of stock by summer 1967.\n\n#### 203b.

Fourteen dialogues\nwere omitted. Simon and Schuster used the word “abridged” on the title\npage; the ML title page, which indicates that the volume was “selected\nand edited” by Edman, was clearer and more accurate.\n\nThe Simon and Schuster plates were too wide for the ML’s format.

(*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1920, in a volume measuring\napproximately 11½ x 8 in. (280 x 200 mm). ML edition printed from plates\nmade from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the\noriginal introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second\nPreface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. \\[v\\] of the Putnam\nedition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in\nthe volume. Published December 1930. *WR* 27 December 1930. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.\n\nThe Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The\nannouncement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition,\nRockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important\nrevisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations\nthat appear in the six dollar edition” (*PW* 118, 16 August 1930, p.\n574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored\n“two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in\nthe fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently\nwould not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go\nso quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear\nunder the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:\n\n> “Guter Mond, du gehst so stille\n>\n> Durch die Abend Wolken hin.”\n\nThe ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s\nsmaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the\nPutnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by\nabout a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all\nof the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the\ntitle page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam\nbinding.\n\nThe ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to\nAngus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint\nrights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized $1.49 reprint\npublished by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was\nplanning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not\nconsulted about the $1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of\nthe ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2\nJune 1939). Kent bought 240 copies of the discontinued ML edition at\ntwenty-five cents each (Kent to Cerf, 8 June 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMelville, *Moby Dick*, illus.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1930 1930 The Modern Library’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City\nPublishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in\nhard-cover reprints, was announced on 4 April. The Sun Dial Library had\nbeen in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary\nworks similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it\nincluded fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun\nDial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American\nseries that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf\nregarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April\n1930).\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library gave the Modern Library access to a\nnumber of titles that Cerf and Klopfer had tried to secure from\nDoubleday in the past. The series included major works by Joseph Conrad,\nAldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, William McFee, and Christopher\nMorley, all of whom were Doubleday authors. Other desirable titles in\nthe series included Katherine Mansfield’s *Garden Party*, Bram Stoker’s\n*Dracula*, and H. G. Wells’s *Tono-Bungay*.\n\nAs part of the agreement the Modern Library secured reprint rights to\nfour Doubleday titles—Arnold Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Aldous\nHuxley’s *Point Counter Point*, W. Somerset Maugham’s *Of Human\nBondage*, and Horace Walpole’s *Fortitude*—that were not part of the Sun\nDial Library. Cerf and Klopfer had been trying to secure reprint rights\nto these titles for several years. The Modern Library agreed to pay\nDoubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy for these four titles—two\ncents more than Cerf and Klopfer were then paying for any other book in\nthe ML with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men* (159). The four\ntitles were added to the Modern Library between September 1930 and\nJanuary 1931.\n\nEleven of the 53 titles in the Sun Dial Library were added to the ML\nbetween 1931 and 1937: Conrad, *Lord Jim* (210); Mansfield, *The Garden\nParty* (214); Morley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (213); McFee, *Casuals of\nthe Sea* (223); Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225); Stoker, *Dracula* (231);\nConrad, *Victory* (238); Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (248); Huxley,\n*Antic Hay* (233); Maugham, *Moon and Sixpence* (283); and Collins, *The\nMoonstone* (G31). All of these except *The Moonstone* appear to have\nbeen protected by copyright and could not have been included in the ML\nwithout the permission of Doubleday, Doran.\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library was a straight cash transaction.\nThe Modern Library acquired the entire stock of Sun Dial Library books,\nabout 87,000 volumes, and got the right for five years to add any title\nfrom the series for which Doubleday, Doran controlled the copyright. No\nplates were involved since Garden City Publishing Co., like other\nreprint publishers, printed from the original publishers’ plates. The\ntotal cost was just under $25,000. This represented the exact\nmanufacturing cost of each volume, a royalty of ten cents a copy, and an\nadditional payment of $5,000.\n\nThe books were transferred to the Modern Library’s warehouse at the\nWolff Bindery in New York. Cerf estimated that no more than half of the\nbooks could be sold at full price. Cerf and Klopfer hoped at first to\nsell enough books at the regular price to enable them to remainder the\nrest at the end of the year and still break even (Cerf to Crowder, 10\nApril 1930). Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, the big New York department\nstores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them\nat sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to\n60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned\nthe idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan\nCo. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were\nbeing offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55\npercent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big\naccount in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but\nCerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J.\nSmalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931).\n\nOther ways were found to dispose of the weakest titles. Many of them\nwere bartered for Modern Library advertising in college newspapers, and\nseveral booksellers agreed to accept Sun Dial Library books as the\nModern Library’s contribution toward cooperative advertising. By\nSeptember 1933 the Sun Dial Library stock was almost gone.\n\nCerf commented to the ML’s senior sales representative, “Considering the\ngeneral depression, our Modern Library sales seem to be holding up\nwonderfully. The new picture jackets help, and the Fall additions should\ncause general satisfaction, I believe” (Cerf to Crowder, 11 July 1930).\n\nThe ML ordered new typesettings and plates for three of its most popular\ntitles: Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Bennett, *Old Wives Tale*\n(207), and Stoker, *Dracula* (231).\n\nErnest Hemingway paid tribute to the ML’s format in December 1930. He\nhad shattered his arm in a serious car accident in early November and\nwas recuperating in Key West after spending seven weeks in a Billings,\nMontana hospital. In a letter to Cerf typed by his wife Pauline he\ngratefully described Modern Library books as “the proper size for\none-handed reading” (Hemingway to Cerf, 26 December 1930). Nineteen titles were added and four were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of active titles to 182. Minor discrepancies between the number\nof titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due\nprimarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January\npublication on fall lists. Fall 1930 jackets also list Merejkowski,\n\n*Peter and Alexis* (227), which was originally announced for August 1930\nbut was delayed until December 1931. All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages\non each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32\npages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side\nof the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). Except for Rockwell Kent’s *Wilderness* (205) all new titles had the\nfinal version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face\ntype and torchbearer A2, A3, or C1 (see individual entries).\n*Wilderness* had an individually designed title page featuring an\nillustration by Kent; torchbearer B appears on the verso of the title\npage. Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published in all four bindings.\nSee the illustration of Huysmans, *Against the Grain*, which shows four\ncopies of the fall 1930 first printing, each in a binding of a different\ncolor.\n\nRockwell Kent’s B1 binding with the grape vine design at the base of the\nspine and his torchbearer stamped in gold on the front panel was used in\nits full form through spring 1930. The additional gold required for the\nB1 binding increased the ML’s costs by half a cent per volume, and the\nbinding was discontinued after a single season.\n\nThe balloon cloth B2 binding was used for the first seven titles\npublished in fall 1930. The B2 binding is identical to B1 except for the\ntorchbearer, which is blind stamped on the front panel. Titles published\ninitially in the B2 binding are Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (197), Mencken,\n*Selected Prejudices* (198), Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Goethe,\n*Faust* (200), Walpole, *Fortitude* (201), Young, *The Medici* (202),\nand Huxley, *Point Counter Point* (203).\n\nBalloon cloth binding C replaced Kent’s original design for the last\nthree titles published in 1930: Plato, *Works* (204), Kent, *Wilderness*\n(205), and Huysmans, *Against the Grain* (206). Kent’s grape vine design\nis omitted from the spine, but his torchbearer, reduced in size from 36\nto 27 mm, is again stamped in gold on the front panel. Balloon cloth\nbinding C was used through April 1931 and was superseded by balloon\ncloth binding D in May 1931.\n\nEarly in 1930 Klopfer asked H. Wolff, the ML’s bindery, to look into the\npotential savings of using imitation gold (“oriental tissue”) instead of\ngenuine gold on the bindings, noting that it would have to save at least\na penny per book to make the change worthwhile (Klopfer to Bert Wolff,\n23 January 1930). Wolff indicated that imitation gold would save .003\nper copy or $3.00 per thousand—a savings of $1,500–1,800 a year (Wolff\nto Klopfer, 20 January 1930). As a test Klopfer asked that the ML’s May\ntitle, *Oriental Romances* (196), be stamped in imitation gold. Wolff\nmistakenly used imitation gold on the ML’s entire current binding order\nof 118,404 volumes instead of genuine gold as specified in the contract\n(RH Box 766, Wolff folder). Balloon cloth binding B2 with the\ntorchbearer blind stamped on the front panel appears to have been the\nsolution to the problem.\n\n**Library Edition**\n\nTwenty-five ML titles were offered in special bindings for the library\nmarket. The flexible balloon cloth bindings used for volumes sold in\nstores did not withstand repeated readings and thus were not well suited\nto library use. Volumes in the “Library Edition” were bound in sturdy\nblue buckram over stiff boards with headbands at the head and foot of\nthe spine. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings in the regular ML, the\nbindings were reinforced with mull, also known as crash—a strip of\nsturdy starched fabric that was glued over the folded gatherings at the\nspine, with flaps extending about half an inch on each side that were\nglued to the inside of the front and back boards. The titles were:\n\n*American Poetry* *1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology*, ed. Aiken\n(169.1)\n\nBeebe, *Jungle Peace* (116)\n\n*Best Ghost Stories* (67)\n\n*Best Russian Short Stories*, ed. Seltzer (18)\n\nBrontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120)\n\nCarroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass,\nThe Hunting of the Snark* (111)\n\nCellini, *Autobiography* (132)\n\nDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (171)\n\nDouglas, *South Wind* (114)\n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed. Starrett (155)\n\nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (21)\n\nHardy, *Return of the Native* (126)\n\nHudson, *Green Mansions* (90)\n\nIbsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People* (6)\n\nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (128)\n\nMelville, *Moby Dick* (124)\n\nMeredith, *Diana of the Crossways* (14)\n\nMeredith, *Ordeal of Richard Feverel* (144)\n\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154)\n\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (9)\n\nSchreiner, *Story of an African Farm* (142)\n\nSterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158)\n\nSymonds, *Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti* (164)\n\nWilde, *Picture of Dorian Gray* (1)\n\nWilde, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*\n(76)\n\nFifteen of the titles were ones that Cerf and Klopfer added between fall\n1925 and 1928; ten had originally appeared in the Boni & Liveright\nseries. The attempt to market ML books to libraries was not a success,\nprobably because the small size of the volumes and the narrow margins\ndid not allow for rebinding.\n\nBuckram bindings for the library market were again made available for\nmany ML titles in the 1960s, more than twenty years after the ML\nintroduced its larger format. This time the optional buckram bindings\nappear to have been successful. Rockwell Kent endpapers used in spring 1930 were available in three\ndifferent colors and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth\nbindings. Blue and green bindings continued to be paired with pale green\n(149) endpapers; brown bindings examined had light reddish brown (42)\nendpapers; and red bindings had endpapers in light orange (52).\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were in moderate orange (53).\nModerate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from\nfall 1930 through spring 1939, except for the oversize volume, John\nReed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935: 280) and three spring 1939\ntitles—Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317), Isak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic\nTales* (320), and *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTen of the 1930 titles were published in individually designed pictorial\njackets. Seven appeared in uniform typographic jacket D. Maugham, *Of\nHuman Bondage* (199) was published in uniform typographic jacket E;\nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (203) had a non-pictorial jacket designed\nby E. McKnight Kauffer. 95 cents. (Spring) Hemingway, *Sun Also Rises* xGoethe, *Faust*. (Fall) Goethe,\n*Faust* xConrad, *Lord Jim*. Cerf wanted to include John Galsworthy’s *Forsyte Saga* in the Modern\nLibrary but realized that Scribner’s was unlikely to grant reprint\nrights. He wrote Maxwell Perkins in 1930, “I eagerly await hearing of\nMr. Scribner’s reaction to my suggestion for the *Forsyte Saga*. I hope\nthat I did not move him to physical violence. I am convinced the idea is\nnot as ridiculous as it very likely appears at first blush” (Cerf to\nPerkins, 4 December 1930). Perkins replied that there was no possibility\nof granting reprint rights (Perkins to Cerf, 4 December 1930). Nine\nyears later Cerf offered an advance of $7,500 to publish *The Forsyte\nSaga* as a Giant (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939). Galsworthy’s\nsequence of three novels and two interludes never appeared in the ML.\n\nCerf contacted John W. Luce & Co. about rights to a John Millington\nSynge anthology (Cerf to Mr. Schaff, 23 June 1930). Cerf contacted\nLongman’s for the rights to H. Rider Haggard’s *She*, J. C. Van Dyke’s\n*History of Painting*, and G. F. Young’s history from 44 B.C. to 1453\nA.D., *East and West through Fifteen Centuries* (Cerf to J. Ray Beck, 25\nSeptember 1930). The only one of these titles that was ever added to the\nML was *She*—and that was over 25 years later, when Haggard’s *She &\nKing Solomon’s Mines* (492) appeared in the ML in 1957.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Goethe’s *Faust* and *The Sayings of Confucius* (Crowder to\nCerf, 12 April 1930 and 30 September 1930). *Faust* (200) was published\nin the ML that fall. *The Wisdom of Confucius* (312) appeared in the ML\nin 1938 and became one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. V. F.\nCalverton, who edited *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183)\nfor the ML in 1929, offered to edit *Tales of E. T. A. Hoffman* for the\nseries; Cerf indicated that the book was a possibility in the future\n(Cerf to Calverton, 10 December 1930).\n\nThe ML decided not to publish Guillaume Apollinaire’s *La Rome des\nBorgia* after a reader’s report judged it pornographic and valueless as\nhistory. The reader commented, “The whole simply stinks of obscenity and\nabnormality” (“Ray” to Klopfer, 18 February 1930).\n\nFerris Greenslet urged Cerf to publish a ML edition of Alain-Fournier’s\nnovel *The Wanderer* (*Le Grand Meaulnes*), which was originally\npublished in Paris in 1913 and appeared in an English translation\npublished by Houghton Mifflin in 1928, fourteen years after the young\nauthor’s death in action in the First World War. “I hope very much that\nyou are going to feel like doing something about THE WANDERER, both\nbecause we would like the business and because I personally have a\nprofound interest in extending the reputation of Alain Fournier”\n(Greenslet to Cerf, 5 September 1930). Cerf appears to have been\nskeptical about its sales potential. Roger L. Scaife, who would move\nfrom Houghton Mifflin to Little, Brown & Co. a short time later, replied\nto Cerf: “You may be right about THE WANDERER. The story took hold of us\nhere so strongly that we thought it a gem that should be preserved and\nsold year after year. Whether that is possible or not, I do not know.\nYour judgment is understandably better than mine in this case” (Scaife\nto Cerf, 6 October 1930). A new English translation by Frank Davison was\npublished in 1959 under the title *The Lost Domain* by Oxford University\nPress in its World’s Classics series and reprinted in Penguin Modern\nClassics as *Le Grand Meaulnes* in 1966. A third English translation by\nRobin Buss appeared in Penguin Classics in 2007 under the title *The\nLost Estate*.\n\nThe Marxist poet and novelist Isidor Schneider, who was in charge of\nadvertising at Horace Liveright, Inc., and whose wife, Helen Berlin, had\nbeen Cerf and Klopfer’s first secretary, recommended Ivan Goncharov’s\n*Oblomov* for the ML. The Natalie Duddington translation, published by\nMacmillan the previous year, was the first complete translation in\nEnglish. Schneider, who later served as literary editor of the *New\nMasses*, considered *Oblomov* one of the world’s ten best novels\n(Schneider to Cerf, 1 April 1930; Schneider Special Manuscript\nCollection, Columbia University Library). The Duddington translation was\npublished in Everyman’s Library in 1932, but *Oblomov* was never added\nin the ML.

The Sun Dial Library had\nbeen in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary\nworks similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it\nincluded fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun\nDial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American\nseries that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf\nregarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April\n1930). [object Object]",
