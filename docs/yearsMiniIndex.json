      "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1925",
      "year": "1925",
      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1925 1925 The Modern Library series was founded in May 1917 by Boni & Liveright,\na new publishing firm that was created to publish the Modern Library.\nThe series was conceived by Albert Boni, a twenty-five year old\nGreenwich Village bookseller and occasional publisher. The Modern\nLibrary was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an\nintense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural\nupheaval. His Washington Square Bookshop was a favorite gathering\nplace for Village artists and intellectuals. He was one of the\nfounders of the Washington Square Players. As publisher of The Glebe,\na little magazine edited by Alfred Kreymborg, he was already active in\npromoting translations of modern European writers—much to the dismay\nof Kreymborg, who was interested mainly in discovering and nurturing\nunknown Americans.\n\nIn May 1925, less than two years after joining Boni & Liveright as\nvice-president president, Bennett A. Cerf negotiated an agreement to\nbuy the Modern Library from Horace Liveright. He had dreamed of having\nhis own firm from the time he entered publishing, and Liveright, as\nusual, needed money. The firm had not had a best seller since 1923,\nLiveright was losing money in the stock market, he was beginning to\nmoonlight as a Broadway producer, and he wanted a divorce. As part of\nthe separation agreement he had to repay large sums that he had\nborrowed from his wife and father-in-law. Tom Dardis, Liveright’s\nlatest biographer, indicates that the debts to his wife and\nfather-in-law had been repaid at this point and speculates that his\nprimary reason for selling the Modern Library was “the huge amounts he\nrequired to continue producing plays on Broadway” (Dardis, Firebrand:\nThe Life of Horace Liveright, p. 228).\n\nIn his unpublished autobiography, written shortly before his death,\nLiveright indicates that the meeting at which the sale of the Modern\nLibrary was agreed to was preceded by several weeks of conversations and\nmeetings with friends and advisers and with Cerf and his advisers\n(Autobiography, insert y, p. 2. Komroff Papers, Columbia University\nLibrary). Cerf recalls the decision as having been proposed and settled\non May 19. Liveright, who took Cerf to a farewell luncheon to celebrate\nCerf’s departure that evening for his first trip to Europe, complained\nabout financial pressures. Cerf repeated an offer he had made before to\nbuy the Modern Library. This time, instead of brushing him off,\nLiveright asked what he would pay for it, and they continued to\nnegotiate at the office that afternoon. By the end of the afternoon a\ndeal had been struck (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 44–46).\n\nCerf and Liveright agreed to a selling price of $200,000. Included in\nthat sum was the $25,000 that Cerf had lent Liveright when he joined the\nfirm and an additional $25,000 he lent him subsequently. Cerf was\ngetting the Modern Library for an additional payment of $150,000. The\nmoney was due after Cerf’s return from Europe, with Cerf to assume\ncontrol of the series on August 1st.\n\nThat evening Cerf sailed on the *Aquitania* for his first trip to\nEurope. That night he wrote in his diary:\n\n> And so I’m off for bed after the most eventful day of my life. I\n> bought the Modern Library from Boni & Liveright after a whirlwind\n> conference—a step that will alter my entire career (Cerf, Diary, 20\n> May 1925, Bennet Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library).\n\nHe celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday on his last full day at sea\nbefore arriving at Southampton on May 26th.\n\nMany details of the purchase remained to be settled. Cerf’s plans called\nfor Donald S. Klopfer to put up $100,000 and go in with him as equal\npartner, but Klopfer was not certain at the time Cerf sailed that he\nwould be able to raise the money. The two men had met during the autumn\nof 1918 at Columbia University, when Cerf was a senior and Klopfer was a\nfreshman. Klopfer transferred to Williams College in the middle of his\nfreshman year, but he and Cerf remained friends. Cerf recalled in his\nautobiography that after attending a concert at Carnegie Hall they\nwalked “all the way around Central Park – over to Fifth Avenue up to\n110th Street, over to Central Park West and down to 59th Street, just\ntalking. And when we finished that walk, we were friends for life”\n(Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 24–25).\n\nKlopfer left college after his sophomore year to work for his\nstepfather, who held a one-sixth interest in United Diamond Works, a\ndiamond cutting and polishing factory in Newark, New Jersey. His\nstepfather had since died, leaving Klopfer his interest in the closely\nheld firm. The other owners agreed to buy Klopfer’s interest for 80\npercent of the book value, giving him the $100,000 he needed (Klopfer,\ninterview with GBN, 5 July 1978), and he had the money by the time Cerf\nreturned from Europe.\n\nThat gave Cerf and Klopfer enough money to buy the Modern Library, but\nthey lacked working capital to meet operating expenses. At this point\nCerf’s uncle, Herbert Wise, came to their aid, lending them 500 shares\nof Norfolk and Western railroad stock, which was then selling for about\n$130 a share. They used the stock as collateral for a $50,000 bank loan.\nThey returned the stock to Wise a hundred shares at a time and were able\nto pay off the entire loan within two years.\n\nOne final hitch came up before the sale of the Modern Library was\ncompleted. At the last minute Liveright insisted that Cerf and Klopfer\ngive him a contract as an adviser for five years at five thousand\ndollars a year. “His advice was the last thing we needed,” Cerf\nrecalled, “but he said if we didn’t agree to it, the deal was off. So we\nhad to give in” (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 54). Shortly after they took over\nthe series they offered Liveright a lump payment of fifteen thousand\ndollars to cancel the agreement, and Liveright accepted. So the total\ncost of the Modern Library came to $215,000.\n\nOwnership of the Modern Library was transferred to Cerf and Klopfer on 1\nAugust 1925. They acquired the name and good will of the series, reprint\nrights to copyrighted titles included in it, the plates owned by Boni &\nLiveright, and the stock of books on hand, most of which were unbound.\nThe value of the plates and books was estimated at $75,000 (Columbia\nAuditors, C.P.A. to Henry Hoyns, Harper and Bros., 22 July 1925).\n\nThe new company was incorporated as The Modern Library, Inc., with Cerf\nas President and Klopfer as Vice-President. Gustave Cerf (Cerf’s\nfather), who worked on a part-time basis until his death in 1941, was\nlisted as Secretary and Treasurer. They were joined by two Boni &\nLiveright employees: Emanuel Harper, who soon became the firm’s\ntreasurer, and Helen Berlin, who was Cerf and Klopfer’s secretary from\n1925 until 1928. The Modern Library, Inc. opened for business in a\ntwo-room office on the ninth floor of 71 West 45th Street. Cerf and\nKlopfer worked at desks facing each other. After moving to larger\nquarters they continued to share an office and work at facing desks\nuntil Klopfer accepted a commission in the Air Force in May 1942. They\nshared a secretary until Cerf’s death in 1971.\n\nThe sale of the Modern Library was announced in the *New York Times* on\n13 July 1925. The following advertisement appeared in *Publishers’\nWeekly* (1 August 1925, p. 423; italics in original):\n\n> News!\n>\n> THE MODERN LIBRARY HAS CHANGED HANDS!\n>\n> ON AUGUST FIRST, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, a new organization\n> will assume publication and distribution of the MODERN LIBRARY.\n>\n> Its name will be the MODERN LIBRARY, Incorporated.\n>\n> Its address will be 71 West 45th Street, New York City.\n>\n> Its sole endeavor will be the further development and exploitation of\n> a series that has grown in eight years to embrace 110 titles, and to\n> be known wherever English books are read.\n>\n> The format and general character of THE MODERN LIBRARY books will be\n> absolutely unchanged.\n>\n> The American bookseller can count on the generous cooperation of an\n> experienced and strongly fortified organization with *no general\n> publications over which to concern itself*, devoting its entire\n> energies to one project – the growth of the MODERN LIBRARY. All new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). A large portion of the ML stock that Cerf and Klopfer acquired from B&L\nconsisted of folded and sewn sheets with Brodzky endpapers attached to\nthe outer leaves. These were sold in ML, Inc. imitation leather bindings\nand newly printed ML, Inc. jackets. This hybrid format, with B&L title\npages and endpapers and ML, Inc. bindings and jackets, is common for\nfinal B&L printings. Bound and jacketed volumes acquired from B&L were\nsold as they were; a small number of bound B&L titles were provided with\nnewly printed ML, Inc. jackets. New titles added to the ML in fall 1925 used the title page design\ninherited from B&L with torchbearer A1 (designed by Lucian Bernhard)\nreplacing the B&L monk device. The title page is enclosed in double\nrules with each section (title, author, author of the introduction,\ndevice, publisher, and place of publication) separated by a horizontal\nrule. Most B&L titles that were reprinted between fall 1925 and 1939\ncontinued to use existing title-page plates with the B&L device replaced\nby torchbearer A1. In general, new title-page plates were made for B&L\ntitles only when the text was reset or augmented with new content. Imitation leather in dark green or brown with spine lettering in gold\nand Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front panel. The bindings were\nidentical to those used by B&L except for the use of the torchbearer\ndevice in place of the B&L device The Brodzky endpaper inherited from B&L was used on the first printing\nof Beebe’s *Jungle Peace* (116) and the earliest ML, Inc. reprints of\nsome B&L titles. Bernhard’s new endpaper incorporating his torchbearer\ndesign, printed in light yellowish brown, was used on all subsequent\ntitles and later printings of *Jungle Peace*. Uniform typographic jacket is patterned after late B&L jackets. The\nBernhard torchbearer replaces the B&L device on the spine but does not\nappear on the front panel. Fall 1925 jackets indicate the title and\nauthor in capital letters on a deep reddish orange band near the top of\nthe front panel and the series (“The Modern Library” in upper- and\nlowercase letters) on a deep reddish orange band near the bottom. The\njackets include a complete list of ML titles on the flaps and back\npanel. Both jacket flaps include the publisher’s name and address: the\nModern Library, Inc., 71 West 45th St., New York. Some fall 1925 jackets\nhave the statement “New title added monthly” at the bottom of the front\nflap instead of the publisher’s name and address. 95 cents. (Fall) Dumas, *Camille* xAnderson, *Poor White*. Theodore Dreiser was one of the first authors Cerf contacted after\nbuying the ML. Cerf expressed the hope that *Free and Other Stories*\n(106) would remain in the series for many years to come and that Dreiser\nwould allow the ML to include one of his novels “on a basis that I am\nsure could be made satisfactory to both of us” (Cerf to Dreiser, 25 July\n1925). *Twelve Men* (159) was added in 1928 and *Sister Carrie* (230)\nfollowed in 1932. *An American Tragedy* (G89), which B&L published in\nfall 1925 shortly after Cerf and Klopfer took over the ML, was reprinted\nas a ML Giant in 1956.\n\nWilla Cather and Edna St. Vincent Millay were among the first authors\nthat Cerf tried to secure for the ML. He wanted Cather’s *Song of the\nLark* and a volume of plays by Millay, but the original publishers\ndeclined to grant reprint rights. *The Song of the Lark* sold too well\nfor Houghton Mifflin to consider a ML edition (Robert N. Linscott,\nHoughton Mifflin, to Cerf, 4 September 1925). Cerf offered Appleton a\nfive-year reprint contract with royalties of 8 cents a copy for Millay’s\nplays “Two Slatterns and a King,” “Aria da Capo,” and “The Lamp and the\nBell”, indicating that he wanted to use Appleton plates for a first ML\nprinting of 3,000 copies. Millay’s publisher flatly rejected the offer\n(John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., to Cerf, 14 October 1925).\n\nAfter meeting Walter de la Mare during his trip to England in the summer\nof 1925, Cerf wrote to enlist his support for a ML edition of one of his\nworks: “I am particularly anxious to have a Walter de La \\[*sic*\\] Mare\ntitle in the library and am writing direct to you because before I\nproceed to interview any of the American publishers who hold the\ncopyright to your works, I would like to hear from you which one of your\nbooks, in your opinion, would fit best in the series” (Cerf to de la\nMare, 16 October 1925). De la Mare replied that the decision must be\nleft to his American publishers but indicated that he had asked his\nagent, James B. Pinker, to take up the matter with them (de la Mare to\nCerf, 19 November 1925). Several weeks later Pinker told Cerf that none\nof de la Mare’s American publishers were willing to authorize a reprint\nedition (James B. Pinker & Sons to Cerf, 14 December 1925).\n\nCerf contacted H. L. Mencken in 1926 about adding his *Philosophy of\nFriedrich Nietzsche* to the series, but Mencken replied that it was\noutmoded and in need of revision (Cerf to Mencken, 14 December 1925;\nMencken to Cerf, 22 December 1925). Originally published in 1908,\nMencken’s study was the first book on Nietzsche in English (Hobson,\nFred. *Mencken: A Life*, p. 89). It has been widely reprinted since it\nentered the public domain, including several reprint editions in the\nfirst decade of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe New York publisher Charles Renard offered to sell the ML its plates\nfor J. M. Barrie’s *The Little Minister*. Cerf replied that the ML would\n“have no possible use for the plates . . . for some time to come” but\noffered $50 for them (Charles Renard Co. to Cerf, 18 November 1925; Cerf\nto Renard Co., 30 November 1925). He later increased the offer to $200,\nbut this appears to have been much less than Renard wanted. Blasco Ibáñez, *The Cabin* (1920) 73\n\nStephens, *Mary, Mary* (1917) 26\n\nOnly a few hundred copies of *Mary, Mary* (26) and *The Cabin* (73)\nremained in the B&L warehouse when Cerf and Klopfer took over the\nseries. They promptly discontinued them and reassigned their catalogue\nnumbers, ML 30 and 69, to Beebe, *Jungle Peace* and Dumas, *Camille*,\nthe first new titles added in fall 1925. The Modern Library series was founded in May 1917 by Boni & Liveright,\na new publishing firm that was created to publish the Modern Library.\nThe series was conceived by Albert Boni, a twenty-five year old\nGreenwich Village bookseller and occasional publisher. The Modern\nLibrary was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an\nintense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural\nupheaval.

One of the additions was Beerbohm, *Zuleika\nDobson*, which had been in the Boni & Liveright series between 1918 and\n1922. *Zuleika Dobson* may have been withdrawn from the series by Dodd,\nMead & Co., which made a new printing of its own in 1924. Two years\nlater Cerf and Klopfer were able to restore it to the series. All\nfamilies of printings of *Zuleika Dobson* in the ML, including those\nbetween 1926 and 1970 (36c‑d), are described in the chapter for 1918. All new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm).

(177 x 118 mm) with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4¾ in.\n(183 x 122 mm) and in 1969 to a taller, slightly slimmer trim size of 7¼\nx 4½ in. (183 x 115 mm) with the binding measuring 7½ x 4⅝ in. (190 x\n118 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side\nof the sheet and bound as gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956\nmost books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet\nand bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\nML books were printed by the Ferris Printing Co. in New York City during\nthe early months of 1926. Later in the year the ML switched to Parkway\nPrinting Co., 400 Lafayette St., New York City. Parkway continued to\nprint all ML books for decades to come except for a small number of\ntitles before the 1960s that were printed by offset lithography. Elmer Adler, proprietor of the Pynson Press in New York, redesigned the\nML title page. He retained the basic design inherited from B&L but made\nthe title page more elegant and appealing. He replaced the B&L\ndouble-rule frame with a frame consisting of a thick outer rule and thin\ninner rule, used open-face type for the title, and eliminated the rule\n\nbetween THE MODERN LIBRARY and the last line of the title page. He also\nchanged PUBLISHERS :: :: NEW YORK to the less cluttered PUBLISHERS · NEW\nYORK and then, beginning with the third title published in 1926, to the\nmore distinctive PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK. He also enlarged Bernhard’s\ntorchbearer from 18 to 26 mm (torchbearer A2). The first version of\nAdler’s title page was used in January with Brontë’s *Wuthering\nHeights*; the latter version was introduced with Wilde’s *De Profundis*\nin April. Adler’s basic title page design remained in use through 1939\nwith changes in the imprint area in 1931 and 1936.\n\nIn general, titles from the B&L era were provided with Adler title pages\nonly when the text was reset or augmented with new content. Examples\ninclude Flaubert, *Madame Bovary* (25.2a) in 1927 and Gautier,\n*Mademoiselle de Maupin & One of Cleopatra’s Nights* (51g) in 1935. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine\nlettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover. Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown. The first two 1926 titles, Brontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120) and\nAnderson, *Poor White* (121), were published in uniform typographic\njacket B1 with no torchbearer on the front panel, “The Modern Library”\nin upper- and lowercase letters on a deep reddish orange band near the\nbottom of the front panel, and a list of ML titles on the flaps and back\npanel. All other titles added to the series in 1926 were published in\nuniform typographic jacket B2, with Bernhard’s torchbearer added to the\nfront panel above the descriptive text and “THE MODERN LIBRARY” printed\nin uppercase letters on the deep reddish orange band near the bottom of\nthe front panel.\n\nUniform typographic jacket B2 and later jackets have the following text\non the front and back flaps:\n\n> 95¢ net ($1 in Canada)\n> *On the inside of this jacket is a list, arranged alphabetically by\n> authors, of all the titles in* <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern\n> library</span>*.

(Spring) Anderson, *Poor White* xJoyce, *Dubliners*. (Fall) Joyce,\n*Dubliners* xHudson, *Purple Land*. Cerf and Klopfer tried to include several titles published by Alfred A.\nKnopf after they bought the Modern Library, but Knopf refused to allow\nany of his publications to be reprinted in the series. His standards of\nproduction and design were the highest of any major American trade\npublisher, and he “did not in those days care to see cheap editions\npublished of our most distinguished books” (Knopf, letter to GBN, 4 May\n1977). Knopf also had other reasons for his coolness toward the ML. He\nassociated Cerf with Horace Liveright, whom he loathed; in particular he\nresented the ML edition of W. H. Hudson’s *Green Mansions* (90). It was\nKnopf’s edition of *Green Mansions*, published in 1916, that established\nthe work in the United States, but Knopf did not own the copyright.\n*Green Mansions* was in the U.S. public domain because its original\nAmerican publication by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in 1904 used imported sheets\nof the English edition. The U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 limited American\ncopyright to works that were printed and bound in the U.S.; the use of\nimported sheets cast a work irretrievably into the U.S. public domain.\nWhen Liveright added *Green Mansions* to the ML he did not pay royalties\nto Knopf. Moreover, he reprinted it with John Galsworthy’s introduction,\nwhich had been written for the Knopf edition but does not appear to have\nbeen copyrighted. Relations between Knopf and the ML remained cool until\nJanuary 1929, when a luncheon meeting organized with the help of Blanche\nKnopf led to friendly relations between the two firms.\n\n> Before 1929 Cerf appealed directly to several Knopf authors in an\n> attempt to secure their support for ML editions of their works. He wrote\n> to Joseph Hergesheimer:\n\n> It is all very well for us to advertise that our Modern Library\n> contains books by all the great modern American writers … but I am\n> extremely conscious of the fact that so long as no book of yours is on\n> the list, there is a glaring gap that we cannot explain.” He asked\n> whether “there is no way for us to have one of your books in the\n> library. I find Mr. Knopf very elusive and vague on the subject of\n> adding any volumes on which he owns the copyright to our series—a\n> condition which I very much regret, because as you know, there are\n> many other items besides your books on his list, which could be put in\n> the Modern Library, to the advantage of everybody. . . . Is there not\n> some way in which you can prevail upon Mr. Knopf to let us have one of\n> your books?\n\nCerf indicated that the ML would prefer *The Three Black Pennies* above\nall others (Cerf to Hergesheimer, 30 March 1926). Hergesheimer’s\nstanding declined in the 1930s, and Cerf did not renew his offer after\nrelations with Knopf improved.\n\nAnother Knopf author that Cerf tried to get for the ML was Arthur\nMachen. He was especially interested in Machen’s *The House of Souls*\n(Knopf, 1922) or *The Hill of Dreams* (Knopf, 1923). During a 1926 visit\nto London Cerf took Machen to lunch at Claridge’s and suggested a ML\nedition of one of the books. Machen’s American agent indicated that both\nbooks were in the U.S. public domain but that the rights situation was\ncomplicated (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 8 June 1927). Cerf indicated\nthat Machen “is anxious to see them in the Library; he is, as usual, as\nyou know, in need of money. However, I believe that we could not do\neither of these books without getting into a serious jam with Knopf, and\nI would do nothing about them unless we had his definite consent” (Cerf\nto Baumgarten, 8 June 1927). Machen also did not want to oppose Knopf in\nany way. He wrote: “My reason is that it was he who brought me out in\nyour country & did everything in his power to make me popular in\nAmerica; also that he has paid me extremely handsome fees for writing\nintroductions. . . . Therefore I should not feel happy in opposing him\nin any matter” (Machen to Cerf, 5 July 1926). None of Machen’s books\nwere reprinted in the ML, but he wrote an introduction to the ML edition\nof Smollett’s *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (179). Cerf paid him $100\nfor the introduction, twice the ML’s usual fee.\n\nOther works that Cerf considered adding to the series included\nMontesquieu’s *Persian Letters*, Frank Swinnerton’s *Nocturne*, and a\nvolume of Edmond Rostand’s plays to include *Cyrano de Bergerac*,\n*Chanticleer*, and *L’Aiglon*. He asked John Erskine to write an\nintroduction to *Persian Letters*, but the volume never appeared (Cerf\nto Erskine, 4 October 1926). Swinnerton’s literary agent declined the\noffer for *Nocturne* (Brandt & Brandt to Cerf, 16 October 1926), and the\nML ended up publishing *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174) as a separate volume\nin 1929.\n\nHorace M. Kallen suggested a volume of Bernard Shaw’s works. Shaw was\nopposed to inexpensive reprints of his plays and kept tight control of\nhis copyrights. Cerf replied, “If you can suggest how in hell’s bells we\ncan sign Shaw up for such a volume, you will immediately be elected\nPatron Saint of the Modern Library” (Cerf to Kallen, 13 October 1926).\nIt was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was\nable to publish two collections of his plays. Shaw relaxed his\nopposition to inexpensive reprints on one occasion toward the end of his\nlife. In 1946 he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of\nhis plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the\noccasion of his ninetieth birthday.\n\nHenry Hoyns of Harper & Bros. suggested W. E. Woodward’s *Bunk*, which\nHarper’s had published three years earlier (Hoyns to Cerf, 15 March\n1926). The Boston publisher Lewis C. Page, who had failed on more than\none occasion to persuade B&L to reprint Gustav Frenssen’s novel\n*Holyland*, repeated his suggestion to the ML’s new owners (Page to ML,\n17 September 1926). Page also suggested Balzac’s *Physiology of\nMarriage* for the ML. Cerf responded, “The Lord knows it is dull enough\nreading, but the title might make it a good seller, and there is just a\nchance that we will be able to make some arrangement with you for its\npublication late next year” (Cerf to Page, 16 February 1926). Page\nreplied, “You are entirely right in your analysis of the literary\nqualities and trade appeal. It is heavy reading for Modernists, but the\ntitle is alluring, and we have a steady sale” (Page to Cerf, 19 February\n1926). For the 1926 Christmas season the ML packaged fifty titles in boxed sets\nof five volumes each. The ten boxed sets were sold primarily in\ndepartment stores and were intended for “that vast army of Christmas\nbook buyers who like to have their shopping made as simple as possible\nfor them” (ML ad, *PW*, 4 September 1926, pp. 803–4). Each set was\ndevoted to a particular theme and sold for $4.75, the same price as five\nvolumes purchased separately. Unlike subsequent Christmas gift boxes,\nbooks in the 1926 sets appear to have been indistinguishable from ML\nvolumes sold separately. None of the boxed sets from 1926 are known to\nhave survived. The ten sets were:\n\n1. *Masterpieces of French Romance*: Gautier, *Mademoiselle de Maupin*;\nFlaubert, *Madame Bovary*; Dumas, *Camille*; France, *The Red Lily*; and\nMaupassant, *Une Vie*.\n\n2. *Great English Novels*: Butler, *The Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *The\nReturn of the Native*; Meredith, *Diana of the Crossways*; Brontë,\n*Wuthering Heights*; and Hudson, *Green Mansions*.\n\n3. *Modern Drama*: Ibsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the\nPeopl*e; Tolstoy, *Redemption and Two Other Plays*; Schnitzler, *Anatol,\nLiving Hours, The Green Cockatoo*; O’Neill, *The Moon of the Caribbees\nand Six Other Plays of the Sea*; and Wilde, *Salomé, The Importance of\nBeing Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*.\n\n4. *Short Stories*: *Best Russian Short Stories*; Balzac, *Short\nStories*; Kipling, *Soldiers Three*; Maupassant, *Love and Other\nStories*; and *Best Ghost Stories*.\n\n5. *Leading American Authors*: Anderson, *Poor White*; Melville, *Moby\nDick*; Cabell, *Beyond Life*; Dreiser, *Free and Other Stories*; and\nJames, *Daisy Miller; An International Episode*.\n\n6. *Books of Modern Thought*: *The Philosophy of William James*;\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra*; Schopenhauer, *Studies in\nPessimism*; Ellis, *The New Spirit*; and *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*.\n\n7. *Great Modern Poetry*: Whitman, *Poems*; Swinburne, *Poems*; Dowson,\n*Poems and Prose*; Blake, *Poems*; and Wilde, *Poems*.\n\n8. *Five Great Juveniles*: Carroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,\nThrough the Looking-Glass, The Hunting of the Snark*; Van Loon, *Ancient\nMan*; *Irish Fairy and Folk Tales*, ed. Yeats; Wilde, *Fairy Tales and\nPoems in Prose*; and Stevenson, *Treasure Island*.\n\n9. *Belles Lettres*: Pater, *The Renaissance*; *The Art of Audrey\nBeardsley*; *A Modern Book of Criticism*; Moore, *Confessions of a Young\nMan*; and Pepys, *Passages from the* *Diary of Samuel Pepys*.\n\n10. *Leading English Authors of Today*: Douglas, *South Wind*;\nBeerbohm, *Zuleika Dobson*; George, *A Bed of Roses*; Lawrence, *Sons\nand Lovers*; and Shaw, *An Unsocial Socialist*.\n\nTen gift boxes to choose from may have been too many, and $4.75 may have\nbeen more than many shoppers wished to spend on a gift. The boxed sets\ncontinued to be listed in the ML’s spring–summer 1927 catalog, but there\nwere no gift boxes for the 1927 holiday season. The following year a\nsingle Christmas gift box of three ML volumes in distinctive jackets and\nbindings was offered at $2.85. Three gift boxes of three volumes each\nwere offered during the 1929 Christmas season.

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927 1927 Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern\nLibrary, Inc., to create and distribute “books of typographic excellence\nin America” (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell\nKent’s newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927).\nThe letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent’s device was\nused. The second appearance was probably Random House’s “Announcement\nNumber One” in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch\nPress (reproduced in Cerf, *At Random*, p. 66). The officers of the new\nventure were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers.\nRandom House became the exclusive American distributor for books\npublished by Francis Meynell’s Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel\nPress, the most important English private presses.\n\nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited\nedition of Voltaire’s *Candide* with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It\nwas printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in\nspring 1928. The colophon states: “Of this first book with imprint of\nRandom House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper\nand 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed\nby Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the\nBauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed\nby the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.”\nRockwell Kent’s signature appeared between the date and the place of\npublication.\n\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock\nmarket crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing.\n\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached\nLiveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former\nBoni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in\nJanuary 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around\nthe same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend\nAlfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927):\n\n> Since I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a\n> price on the business, Bennett having offered me $250,000 and I\n> believe that he could be gotten to pay $300,000. I wrestled with my\n> soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that\n> publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of\n> doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won’t make\n> a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting\n> no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a\n> good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office\n> know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it\n> too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of\n> course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace\n> Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19,\n> Wallerstein family folder). Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued five titles\nfrom the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the total number of active\ntitles to 139. All new ML titles except Lawrence, *The Rainbow* (138) were published in\nthe standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110\nmm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, and the\nlast line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a\ndouble-rule frame. Reprints of earlier titles continued to use their\noriginal ML, Inc. title pages. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue; spine lettering in\ngold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover. Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown. All new titles were published in uniform typographic jacket B2 with\nBernhard’s torchbearer on the front panel. Uniform typographic jacket B1\ncontinued to be used on reprints of most pre-1926 titles. 95 cents. (Spring) Hudson, *Purple Land* xHardy, *Jude the Obscure*. (Fall) Hardy,\n*Jude the Obscure* xDumas, *Three Musketeers*. The original American publishers turned down Cerf’s requests for reprint\nrights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930\nand 1933—Ernest Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (190)*;* John Dewey,\n*Human Nature and Conduct* (195); Joseph Conrad, *Victory* (238);\nAnatole France, *Penguin Island* (253); and Sinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith*\n(254). Scribner’s rejected Cerf’s request to reprint Ring Lardner’s *How\nto Write Short Stories*. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to\ninclude *Round Up*, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the\ntitle *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344).\n\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these\nwere a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young’s\n*Crescent Moon*, Paul Leicester Ford’s *The Honorable Peter Stirling*,\nLytton Strachey’s *Landmarks in French Literature*, Lord Charnwood’s\n*Abraham Lincoln*, O. Henry’s *The Trimmed Lamp*, and William McFee’s\n*Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*.\n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles,\nincluding Henry James, *The Turn of the Screw* and *The American*;\nSantayana, *Soliloquies in England*; Turgenev, *A House* of\n*Gentlefolk*; Bunyan, *The Holy War*; Swift, *Gulliver’s Travels*; Mill,\n*On Liberty*; and Wells, *The Wheels of* *Chance* (Phelps to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1927). Of these *The Turn of the Screw* (189) and *Gulliver’s\nTravels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212) were published\nin the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill’s *On Liberty* was included in *The\nEnglish Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (G45) in 1939 and in *The\nPhilosophy of John Stuart Mill* (537) in 1961.\n\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer*, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to\njustify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26\nMay 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos:\n*Three Soldiers* (248) in 1932, *The 42nd Parallel* (307) in 1937, and\n*U.S.A.* (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George’s\n*Selected Short Stories* (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that\nGeorge was well enough represented in the ML by *A Bed of Roses* (Cerf\nto Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927).\n\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley’s novel *Where the Blue\nBegins*, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of\nretail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML\nwas sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major\ndepartment stores.\n\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F.

(190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). Most new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, (some\nFall titles had B or A3) and the last line of the title page as\nPUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of\nearlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine\nlettering in gold and the Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front\ncover. Bernhard\n\n**Jackets**\n\nSpring 1928 titles were the last published in uniform typographic jacket\nB2. A redesigned typographic jacket was introduced in September and\nmodified in October. In addition to uniform typographic jackets, a\nlimited number of titles were also available in pictorial jackets. The\noption of pictorial jackets may have been inspired by the 1928 Christmas\nGift Box, which featured pictorial jackets printed in spring 1928.\nPictorial jackets are rare; the number of titles available with\npictorial jackets as well as uniform typographic jackets is unknown. Two\nexamples are reproduced in the illustrations.\n\nUniform typographic jacket C, which was completely redesigned except for\nthe torchbearer on the spine and the horizontal bands near the top and\nfoot, was introduced in September 1928 and used on only two titles,\nRabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel (162) and France, Revolt of the\nAngels (163). Both jackets were printed on pale yellow paper; series THE\nMODERN LIBRARY appeared in the lower. The paragraph of descriptive text\nthat had been used on the front panel of ML jackets since 1917 was\ndropped completely. In its place was the title in large capitals that\ncould be read easily from a distance of five or six feet, a torchbearer\nthat was nearly twice the size of the torchbearer on uniform typographic\njacket B2, and brief descriptive text in smaller type. The jacket for\nThe Revolt of the Angels stated, “One of the five of Anatole France’s\ngreatest books available in this edition”; that of Gargantua and\nPantagruel stated, “Intelligently condensed into one volume by <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">prof. donald douglas</span> of Columbia University.”\nThe colored rules did not make the books stand out on bookstore shelves,\nand uniform jacket C was replaced the following month by uniform\ntypographic jacket D.\n\nUniform typographic jacket D, introduced with the two October titles,\nSymonds, Life of Michaelangelo Buonnaroti (164) and The Philosophy of\nSchopenhauer (165), was a significant improvement. The new jackets\ndiffered from uniform typographic jacket C in two respects. The colored\nrules near the top and foot were extended to the upper and lower edges\nof the jacket, creating colored borders 7/16 inch wide which extended\nover the front and back panels, backstrip, and jacket flaps. And the\njackets were printed in different color combinations. The borders were\nprinted in deep reddish orange, moderate blue, or moderate yellowish\ngreen; the paper stock was light greenish blue, brilliant yellow, or\npale yellow. Most booksellers displayed Modern Library books together.\nThe vivid and varied colors of the jacket borders and paper stock\nsignificantly increased the visual appeal of groups of ML books\ndisplayed in book and department stores.\n\nThe Modern Library printed new uniform jackets for the entire series,\nnot just for newly published titles. First printings of Gargantua and\nPantagruel and Revolt of the Angels, originally published in uniform\ntypographic jacket C, are also found in uniform typographic jacket D.\n\nThe text on the back panel of uniform typographic jackets C and D was\nalso revised.\n\nThe upper band which indicates the author on the front panel and spine,\ncontains the following statement on the back panel:\n\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern library</span>\n>\n> Books that have something to say\n>\n> to the Modern Mind\n>\n> The area between the upper and lower bands states:\n>\n> *How many* <span class=\"smallcaps\">modern library</span> *books*\n>\n> *have you read?*\n>\n> A complete list of the 150 books in The Modern Library series will be\n> found on the inside of the jacket. They are representative works by\n> modern authors of the first rank, supplemented by a group of books\n> that, although they were written centuries ago, are still *modern* in\n> the full sense of the word. How many of these books have you read? How\n> many are in your library? Handsome, durable, and inexpensive Modern\n> Library editions enable them to be secured at a fraction of their\n> usual cost. Jot down the numbers of volumes you desire on the coupon\n> below. Give it to your bookseller. If there is no bookseller near you,\n> the publisher will supply you.\n\nLike uniform jacket B2, a complete list of Modern Library titles is\nprinted inside uniform typographic jackets C and D. 95 cents.\n\n**Dating key**\n\n**(***Spring*) Dumas, *Three Musketeers* xApuleius, *Golden Ass*.\n(*Fall*) Apuleius, *Golden Ass* xDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*. Cerf expressed interest in several titles published by Doubleday, Doran,\nincluding works by Joseph Conrad (*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Youth*,\n*Chance*, or *Nigger of the Narcissus*), Aldous Huxley (*Chrome Yellow*\nor *Antic Hay*), W. Somerset Maugham (*Of Human Bondage*, *The Moon and\nSixpence*, or *The Trembling of a Leaf*), William McFee (*Captain\nMacedoine’s Daughter*, *Command*, or *Casuals of the Sea*), and Horace\nWalpole (*Fortitude*). He offered the ML’s highest royalty—12 cents a\ncopy—on any of these books (Cerf to Russell Doubleday, 25 April 1928),\nbut Doubleday, Doran was not receptive. The Modern Library was able to\ninclude seven of these titles—*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Antic Hay*, *Of\nHuman Bondage*, *Moon and Sixpence*, *Casuals of the Sea*, and\n*Fortitude*—in the early 1930s as a result of its purchase of the Sun\nDial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint\nsubsidiary. (See the introductory matter for 1930 for more information\non the Sun Dial Library purchase.)\n\nAnother author Cerf wanted in the ML was Ernest Hemingway. He told\nHemingway, “We are very anxious indeed to add a book of yours to our\nModern Library series” (Cerf to Hemingway, 29 October 1928). The ML was\nable to secure reprint rights to *The Sun Also Rises* and *A Farewell to\nArms* in the early 1930s; *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* was\nadded to ML Giants in 1942.\n\nWhen Cerf told Sinclair Lewis that he wanted one if his books in the\nseries, Lewis replied that the decision was up to Harcourt, Brace (Lewis\nto Cerf, 1928). The ML was able to add *Arrowsmith* in 1933 and three\nadditional titles by Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBernice Baumgarten of the literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested a ML\nedition of John Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers*, which had never appeared\nin a reprint edition (Baumgarten to Cerf, 6 March 1928). Cerf, who had\npreviously declined to reprint Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*,\nreplied, “We will not be interested in doing John Dos Passos’ ‘Three\nSoldiers’ in the Modern Library. I know the book well, and though I\nthink it is an excellent piece of work, I do not feel that Dos Passos\nquite rates the Modern Library” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 7 March 1928). Cerf\nlater changed his mind. Three books by Dos Passos were published in the\nML in the 1930s: *Three Soldiers* (1932: 248), *The* *42nd Parallel*\n(1937: 307), and *U.S.A.* (1939: G42).\n\nCerf offered Harcourt, Brace an advance of $1,800 against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for reprint rights to Lytton Strachey’s *Queen\nVictoria*, provided the ML could print from Harcourt plates (Cerf to\nHarrison Smith, 21 April 1928). Harcourt, Brace declined on the grounds\nthat Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex*, published that year, would revive\ninterest in the earlier work (Harrison Smith to Cerf, 11 May 1928).\nStrachey’s *Eminent Victorians* was added to the series in 1933.\n\nCerf also wanted to include anthologies devoted to American poetry and\nEnglish poetry. Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry, 1671–1928: A\nComprehensive Anthology* (169.1), published early in 1928, was compiled\nfor the Modern Library. Cerf sought permission to reprint John\nDrinkwater’s *Anthology of English Verse* (Houghton Mifflin, 1924), but\nthe publisher rejected the offer (Curtis Brown to Cerf, 13 July 1928).\n\nKlopfer offered a $4,000 advance against a royalty of 12 cents a copy\nfor James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* (Klopfer to H. C. Latham,\nMacmillan, 27 November 1928). Despite subsequent offers, the book never\nappeared in the ML. Appleton declined Cerf’s offer of a $3,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy for Stephen Crane’s *Red Badge of\nCourage* (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928).\nThe ML finally secured reprint rights to Crane’s novel fourteen years\nlater.\n\nE. Clark Stillman suggested a volume of Heinrich Heine’s poems for the\nML and offered to do the translations (Stillman to ML, 15 June 1928). A\nreader suggested a volume of poetry by Alfred Noyes. Cerf replied to the\nlatter suggestion, “. . . the idea is a mighty good one, and we shall\ninvestigate it at once” (Cerf to Mrs. R. G. Pattern, 29 October 1928).\nNothing came of either suggestion.\n\n**Christmas gift box**\n\nFor the 1928 Christmas season the ML offered a boxed set titled *Three\nRenaissance Romances* consisting of three titles—Cellini,\n*Autobiography* (1927: 132), Merejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*\n(1928: 154), and Symonds, *Life of Michelangelo* *Buonarroti* (1928:\n164) in distinctive bindings and jackets. The bindings were brightly\ncolored Keratol, a treated book cloth stamped in a geometric pattern,\nwith the same gold stamping as other volumes of the period. The Cellini\nbinding was light greenish blue (172), Merejkowski was vivid orange\n(48), Symonds was light yellowish green (135). Each jacket had an inset\nillustration printed in black on colored paper; the jackets are\ndescribed in the entries for each title. Volumes in Keratol bindings\nhave spring 1928 jackets and fall 1928 lists at the end of the volumes,\nexcept for Cellini which has no list. The retail price of each set was\n$2.85. Orders came mainly from department stores. Cerf noted after the\nChristmas season that the boxed set had proved so popular that it would\nbe carried in stock regularly (Cerf to Desmond FitzGerald, 13 February\n1929). This does not appear to have been done, but the *Three\nRenaissance Romances* gift box was offered again during the 1929\nChristmas season.

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1929 1929 With a few exceptions such as Villon, *Poems* (55) and *Passages from\nthe Diary of Samuel Pepys* (89), the Boni & Liveright series remained\ntrue to its name and limited its scope to modern works. Cerf and Klopfer\nincreased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added\nDefoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto\nCellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928\nwhen Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and\nRabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles\npublished in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156),\nSmollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury\nTales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of\nthese works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York\nSociety for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them\nin the eyes of the shallowest modernist.\n\nCerf and Klopfer were interested in publishing older classics besides\nthose that appealed specifically to modernist readers, but they\nquestioned whether the Modern Library was the appropriate vehicle for\nthem. Responding to a list of suggestions for the ML in 1928, Klopfer\ncommented, “The one that intrigues me most is the ‘Selected Poems of\nJohn Donne’, although I am not sure that he would fit into the *Modern*\nLibrary” (Klopfer to John W. Gassner, 22 March 1928).\n\nFor a time they contemplated starting a separate series of older\nclassics along the lines of Everyman’s Library. They scoured the lists\nof Everyman’s Library, Loeb Classical Library, and the “100 Best Books”\nfor potential titles. The lists they compiled consisted mainly of\nstandard works of classical and English literature, together with those\nof the Renaissance and, to a lesser extent, French literature. After\nconsidering various names for the series, they seem to have settled\ntentatively on the name Seven Seas Library; that at least is the name\nthat appears most often in penciled memos from this period. Other names\nincluded Phoenix Library, Salamander Library, Pantheon Library, Mercury\nLibrary, and Random House Classics.\n\nAnother possibility they considered was taking over an existing series\nof standard classics. In 1929 Cerf wrote to J. M. Dent & Co., the\nEnglish publishers of Everyman’s Library, offering to distribute the\nseries in the United States. American distribution of the series had\nbeen handled since its inception by E. P. Dutton Co. The relationship\nbetween the two firms was very close, and Dent had no interest in\nchanging American distribution of the series (Cerf to Hugh R. Dent, 12\nDecember 1929; Dent to Cerf, 1 January 1930). Cerf’s inquiry may have\ncontributed to the soured relations between Dutton and the Modern\nLibrary that persisted for many years.\n\nIn the end Cerf and Klopfer decided not to start a separate series of\nolder classics. Many of the works listed as potential titles for the\nSeven Seas Library eventually found their way into the Modern Library.\n\nAnother change in scope was that the Modern Library gradually lost its\nEuropean orientation and became a series with neither European nor\nAmerican authors seemingly outweighing the other. Signs of increased\ninterest in American authors appeared soon after Cerf and Klopfer bought\nthe series. A 1926 advertisement featuring photographs of Modern Library\nauthors showed four Americans—Walt Whitman, Sherwood Anderson, James\nBranch Cabell, and Eugene O’Neill—and one European, Anatole France (ML\nadvertisement, *New York Herald Tribune Books*, 7 November 1926). The\nModern Library catalogue for 1927, announcing publication of *The\nScarlet Letter*, stated: “The addition of this splendid novel is\nconsistent with the avowed intention of the publishers to include in the\nModern Library as many American authors as possible” (ML catalogue,\nSpring-Summer 1927).\n\nAmerican authors were added regularly to the ML after 1925. No year went\nby without the publication of works by Americans, but the balance was\nnot tipped suddenly in their favor. Of the twelve titles published in\n1926, three were by Americans: Anderson, *Poor White* (121), Melville,\n*Moby-Dick* (124), and Lewisohn, *Up Stream* (128). The greatest\nconcentration of Americans added to the series before 1930 came in 1927,\nwhen six out of nineteen new titles were by American authors.\n\nAs with the inclusion of older classics, the new emphasis on American\nworks did not become abundantly clear until the 1930s. The stock market\ncrash of October 1929 ended seven years of prosperity, but the ML\nentered the Depression in a strong position. As Cerf wrote in 1929, “The\nModern Library is no longer an experiment; it has become an institution\nin the book world. . . . These ubiquitous books . . . at one time or\nanother have penetrated into nearly every American home and into the\nlibraries of many readers in other countries” (“The Modern Library,”\n*Publishers’ Weekly*, 9 February 1929, p. 657; published anonymously but\nwritten by Cerf). Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen titles, bringing the total number of\nactive titles to 167. No titles were discontinued. Minor discrepancies\nbetween the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML\njackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles\nprojected for January publication on fall lists.\n\n**Format and printing**\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and the last line of the title page as\nPUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Adler’s title\npage was used with two different torchbearers. The six titles published\nJanuary–March had torchbearer B; the thirteen titles published\nApril-December reverted to Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2. The imitation leather bindings used since 1917 had never been altogether\nsatisfactory. Castor oil used in manufacturing the imitation leather\ncaused the bindings to emit a fishy odor in warm weather. Cerf and\nKlopfer began to think seriously about abandoning the imitation leather\nbindings in 1928. After experimenting with various binding cloths, they\ndiscovered a natural finish balloon cloth manufactured by the Siegbert\nBook Cloth Corporation that seemed to meet their requirements. They\nprepared samples of the new binding, with semi-flexible covers, and\nshowed them to several leading booksellers and department store buyers.\nThe response was favorable, and they decided to go ahead.\n\nThe balloon cloth binding was officially introduced with the Modern\nLibrary’s January 1929 publications, Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry\n1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology* (169) and Gustave Flaubert’s\n*Salammbô* (170). The old spine and cover design continued to be used\nthrough March, but this was a temporary expedient. Shortly after they\ndecided to substitute balloon cloth for imitation leather, Cerf and\nKlopfer asked Rockwell Kent, who had created the Random House device in\n1927, to make a “simple . . . but characteristic Kentian design for the\nback-strip” (Cerf to Kent, 11 December 1928). Kent more than fulfilled\nhis commission. He not only drew a striking new spine for Modern Library\nbook, but redesigned the torchbearer and created new endpapers as well.\n\nKent began with the idea of putting the torchbearer at the base of the\nspine, but decided that the figure was too attenuated for the space\navailable. Still, he felt that the torch idea should be kept and wanted\nto use a sizable spot of gold to make the spine distinctive. His first\nsolution was a design incorporating a candle. To Klopfer he wrote:\n\n> After, I assure you, making more designs for that book-back than there\n> are published works in the Modern Library; after considering and\n> rejecting innumerable pictorial designs, nudes, phallic symbols, and\n> so forth, as either inappropriate to book covers or indigestible to\n> middle western and New England patrons of your publications; I have\n> conceived and executed the somewhat trite, but I feel appropriate,\n> device which I enclose, and if you feel that in employing a candle as\n> part of it I have gone as far in suggestion as may be permitted,\n> please realize that I have shown some restraint in not making that\n> candle of the horrid dipped variety, so much in vogue in modern days\n> (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929).\n\nThe candle was never used. Cerf had warned Kent that the balloon cloth\nwould not take readily every kind of design, and the candle may have\nbeen too detailed to be stamped clearly. At that point Kent decided that\nnothing could be done with the original design and discarded it.\n\nThree weeks later he sent in an entirely new design. The new design, he\nnoted, “should not only work out better in stamping but . . . in every\nway pleases me more” (Kent to Klopfer, 16 February 1929). Intended for\nthe base of the spine, it consisted of an elegantly styled grape vine\nwith intertwined branches, leaves, and bunches of grapes. Beneath the\nroots of the vine the words “Modern Library” were lettered in sans-serif\ncapitals. Kent recommended that the lettering for the title and author\nat the head of the spine be drawn by hand. “You can get much more\nsatisfactory spacing in that way,” he wrote. “There are innumerable\nprofessional letterers, any of whom can do this every month for you,\npromptly and at little cost” (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929). The ML\ndoes not appear to have adopted this suggestion.\n\nFor the front cover of the binding Kent redrew Bernhard’s torchbearer.\nHe thought Bernhard’s figure was “good in design, but too grotesque to\nbe in keeping with the serious nature of the Modern Library.” Kent drew\na more graceful, floating figure, with the torch, instead of being held\naloft, carried in front of the runner with the flare trailing over the\nrunner’s head. He omitted the words “Modern Library” which had encircled\nBernhard’s figure on the grounds that it was sufficient to have them on\nthe spine. He also made two other changes in the figure. Bernhard’s\nfigure faced left, toward the spine. Kent thought this a violation of\ncommon sense and precedent in book design and turned it around. He also\naltered its sex. Bernhard’s figure was assumed to be feminine; around\nthe Modern Library office it was known as “a dame running away from\nBennett Cerf.” Kent made his version neuter. “I defy you to discover the\nfigure’s sex,” he told Klopfer. “That’s modern enough for you” (ibid).\n\nKent’s binding design was introduced with *The Cabala* by Thornton\nWilder, the Modern Library’s April 1929 title. Bernhard’s torchbearer\nwas not completely superseded by Kent’s figure. It never again appeared\non the binding or endpaper, but it continued to be used on Modern\nLibrary title pages and on many of the jackets.\n\nKent’s work for the Modern Library was a remarkable achievement in book\ndesign. The combination of smooth balloon cloth and Kent’s spine and\nfront cover designs produced what were perhaps the handsomest volumes\nthe Modern Library ever published. Unfortunately, Kent’s design appears\nto have been overly ambitious for books that retailed at ninety-five\ncents. The extra gold it required increased the Modern Library’s binding\ncosts by half a cent per copy. That half cent doomed the design, and it\nwas used in its complete form for less than two years.\n\nThe balloon cloth bindings were available in four colors: red, blue,\ngreen, and brown. The Modern Library published each title simultaneously\nin all four bindings. Two endpaper designs were used in 1929. Lucian Bernhard’s endpaper\nprinted in light yellowish brown remained in use through March. A new\nendpaper designed by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April in\nconjunction with his new binding. Copies of the first printing of\nThornton Wilder, *The Cabala* (175), which was published in April but\nprobably printed in March, exist with both endpapers. The paste-down and\nfree endpapers both featured Kent’s torchbearer at the center,\nsurrounded by a pattern of open books and the initials “ml”. The\nconjunct endpapers were identical except that the two torchbearers faced\neach other. For the first year Kent’s endpapers were available in four\ndifferent colors—light grayish red (18), dark yellowish pink (30), light\nreddish brown (42), and pale green (149)—and were color coordinated with\nthe balloon cloth bindings. Red bindings had light grayish red\nendpapers, blue and green bindings had pale green endpapers, and brown\nbindings had dark yellowish pink or light reddish brown endpapers.\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were printed in moderate\norange (53) and were used with all four binding colors. Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the\nWorld* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the\nlarger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that\nfall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper, with the central panels\nwith Kent’s torchbearer unchanged but with the surrounding pattern of\nopen books and the initials “ml” extended to fill the larger space, was\nintroduced in spring 1940.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll 1929 titles except *The Memoirs of Casanova* (185) were originally\npublished in uniform typographic jacket D. The Casanova jacket has an\ninset illustration of Casanova in left profile holding a candlestick in\none hand and opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle\ncasts a shadow of a satyr on the door. *The Memoirs of Casanova* appears\nto be the first ML title to have been published initially in a pictorial\njacket without the option of a uniform typographic jacket.\n\nAn unknown number of ML titles were available in optional pictorial\njackets as well as the uniform typographic jacket. 95 cents. *Dating keys:* (Spring) Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* xChaucer,\n*Canterbury Tales*. (Fall) Chaucer, *Canterbury Tales* xHemingway, *Sun\nAlso Rises*. Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel *All Quiet on the Western Front*,\nwith sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929\nbest-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of\n$5,000 to $10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in\nthe ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre,\nLittle, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of *All Quiet on the\nWestern Front* was published by Grosset & Dunlap, which distributed its\nhardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast,\nML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and\nthe book departments of major department stores.\n\nIn another long shot, Cerf offered a $6,000 advance against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to\nLowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his\ncopyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive\nreprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s\ndeath, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.\n\nCerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford’s novel *The Honorable\nPeter Stirling*, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset\n& Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book\n(Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley\nanthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11\nDecember 1929).\n\nHendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, *Tolerance* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1925), noting that it was “the sort of book to appeal to the\nfree-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor”\n(Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press\nsuggested André Tridon’s *Psychoanalysis*, originally published by B. W.\nHuebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both\nsuggestions were rejected.\n\nSeveral months after Edmond Rostand’s *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174)\nappeared in the ML, Duffield & Co. inquired if the ML would be\ninterested in Rostand’s later play *Chantecler* or Paul Verlaines’s\n*Poems*. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in *The\nHistory of Mr. Polly* by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24\nOctober 1929).\n\nAlbert Mordell sent his book, *The Erotic Motive in Literature* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no\nplace in the ML because its “appeal is special, and many statements that\nwould have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today” (Cerf to\nMordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell’s book revived in the\n1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier\nBooks and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several\ntranslations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and\nthe first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\n**Christmas gift boxes**\n\nThe ML produced three Christmas gift boxes in 1929. Each set consisted\nof three ML titles in a slipcase. The books had specially designed\npictorial jackets and were advertised as “specially boxed and bound in\ngay colors, with picture jackets” (ML ad, *PW* 116, 21 September 1929,\np. 1265). *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Modern Novels*\nwere new; *Three Great Renaissance Romances* was first offered as a\nChristmas gift box in 1928. The Keratol bindings used in 1928 were\nreplaced by colored balloon cloth which the ML had introduced as its\nstandard binding earlier in the year. The pictorial jackets used for\n*Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Renaissance Romances*\nwere later adapted for use on regular ML printings. Hynd’s pictorial\njackets for the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box were exceptional\nexamples of expressionist graphics but may have been too edgy for the\nML’s mainstream audience. Their use was limited to the 1929 gift box;\nthey were never adapted for use on copies of the books sold separately.\nThe retail price of each set was $2.85. The 1929 gift boxes were the\nlast, though unsold boxes continued to be listed in ML catalogs. The\nthree sets were:\n\n1\\. *Three Great French Romances*: Zola, *Nana*; Gautier, *Mademoiselle\nde Maupin*; Flaubert, *Madame Bovary*.\n\n2\\. *Three Great Renaissance Romances:* Cellini, *Autobiography*;\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*; Symonds, *Life of\nMichelangelo*.\n\n3\\. *Three Great Modern Novels*: Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*;\nButler, *Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *Return of the Native*.

Cerf and Klopfer\nincreased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added\nDefoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto\nCellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928\nwhen Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and\nRabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles\npublished in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156),\nSmollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury\nTales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of\nthese works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York\nSociety for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them\nin the eyes of the shallowest modernist.

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1930 1930 The Modern Library’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City\nPublishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in\nhard-cover reprints, was announced on 4 April. The Sun Dial Library had\nbeen in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary\nworks similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it\nincluded fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun\nDial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American\nseries that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf\nregarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April\n1930).\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library gave the Modern Library access to a\nnumber of titles that Cerf and Klopfer had tried to secure from\nDoubleday in the past. The series included major works by Joseph Conrad,\nAldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, William McFee, and Christopher\nMorley, all of whom were Doubleday authors. Other desirable titles in\nthe series included Katherine Mansfield’s *Garden Party*, Bram Stoker’s\n*Dracula*, and H. G. Wells’s *Tono-Bungay*.\n\nAs part of the agreement the Modern Library secured reprint rights to\nfour Doubleday titles—Arnold Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Aldous\nHuxley’s *Point Counter Point*, W. Somerset Maugham’s *Of Human\nBondage*, and Horace Walpole’s *Fortitude*—that were not part of the Sun\nDial Library. Cerf and Klopfer had been trying to secure reprint rights\nto these titles for several years. The Modern Library agreed to pay\nDoubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy for these four titles—two\ncents more than Cerf and Klopfer were then paying for any other book in\nthe ML with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men* (159). The four\ntitles were added to the Modern Library between September 1930 and\nJanuary 1931.\n\nEleven of the 53 titles in the Sun Dial Library were added to the ML\nbetween 1931 and 1937: Conrad, *Lord Jim* (210); Mansfield, *The Garden\nParty* (214); Morley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (213); McFee, *Casuals of\nthe Sea* (223); Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225); Stoker, *Dracula* (231);\nConrad, *Victory* (238); Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (248); Huxley,\n*Antic Hay* (233); Maugham, *Moon and Sixpence* (283); and Collins, *The\nMoonstone* (G31). All of these except *The Moonstone* appear to have\nbeen protected by copyright and could not have been included in the ML\nwithout the permission of Doubleday, Doran.\n\nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library was a straight cash transaction.\nThe Modern Library acquired the entire stock of Sun Dial Library books,\nabout 87,000 volumes, and got the right for five years to add any title\nfrom the series for which Doubleday, Doran controlled the copyright. No\nplates were involved since Garden City Publishing Co., like other\nreprint publishers, printed from the original publishers’ plates. The\ntotal cost was just under $25,000. This represented the exact\nmanufacturing cost of each volume, a royalty of ten cents a copy, and an\nadditional payment of $5,000.\n\nThe books were transferred to the Modern Library’s warehouse at the\nWolff Bindery in New York. Cerf estimated that no more than half of the\nbooks could be sold at full price. Cerf and Klopfer hoped at first to\nsell enough books at the regular price to enable them to remainder the\nrest at the end of the year and still break even (Cerf to Crowder, 10\nApril 1930). Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, the big New York department\nstores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them\nat sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to\n60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned\nthe idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan\nCo. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were\nbeing offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55\npercent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big\naccount in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but\nCerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J.\nSmalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931).\n\nOther ways were found to dispose of the weakest titles. Many of them\nwere bartered for Modern Library advertising in college newspapers, and\nseveral booksellers agreed to accept Sun Dial Library books as the\nModern Library’s contribution toward cooperative advertising. By\nSeptember 1933 the Sun Dial Library stock was almost gone.\n\nCerf commented to the ML’s senior sales representative, “Considering the\ngeneral depression, our Modern Library sales seem to be holding up\nwonderfully. The new picture jackets help, and the Fall additions should\ncause general satisfaction, I believe” (Cerf to Crowder, 11 July 1930).\n\nThe ML ordered new typesettings and plates for three of its most popular\ntitles: Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Bennett, *Old Wives Tale*\n(207), and Stoker, *Dracula* (231).\n\nErnest Hemingway paid tribute to the ML’s format in December 1930. He\nhad shattered his arm in a serious car accident in early November and\nwas recuperating in Key West after spending seven weeks in a Billings,\nMontana hospital. In a letter to Cerf typed by his wife Pauline he\ngratefully described Modern Library books as “the proper size for\none-handed reading” (Hemingway to Cerf, 26 December 1930). Nineteen titles were added and four were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of active titles to 182. Minor discrepancies between the number\nof titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due\nprimarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January\npublication on fall lists. Fall 1930 jackets also list Merejkowski,\n\n*Peter and Alexis* (227), which was originally announced for August 1930\nbut was delayed until December 1931. All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages\non each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32\npages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side\nof the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). Except for Rockwell Kent’s *Wilderness* (205) all new titles had the\nfinal version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face\ntype and torchbearer A2, A3, or C1 (see individual entries).\n*Wilderness* had an individually designed title page featuring an\nillustration by Kent; torchbearer B appears on the verso of the title\npage. Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published in all four bindings.\nSee the illustration of Huysmans, *Against the Grain*, which shows four\ncopies of the fall 1930 first printing, each in a binding of a different\ncolor.\n\nRockwell Kent’s B1 binding with the grape vine design at the base of the\nspine and his torchbearer stamped in gold on the front panel was used in\nits full form through spring 1930. The additional gold required for the\nB1 binding increased the ML’s costs by half a cent per volume, and the\nbinding was discontinued after a single season.\n\nThe balloon cloth B2 binding was used for the first seven titles\npublished in fall 1930. The B2 binding is identical to B1 except for the\ntorchbearer, which is blind stamped on the front panel. Titles published\ninitially in the B2 binding are Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (197), Mencken,\n*Selected Prejudices* (198), Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199), Goethe,\n*Faust* (200), Walpole, *Fortitude* (201), Young, *The Medici* (202),\nand Huxley, *Point Counter Point* (203).\n\nBalloon cloth binding C replaced Kent’s original design for the last\nthree titles published in 1930: Plato, *Works* (204), Kent, *Wilderness*\n(205), and Huysmans, *Against the Grain* (206). Kent’s grape vine design\nis omitted from the spine, but his torchbearer, reduced in size from 36\nto 27 mm, is again stamped in gold on the front panel. Balloon cloth\nbinding C was used through April 1931 and was superseded by balloon\ncloth binding D in May 1931.\n\nEarly in 1930 Klopfer asked H. Wolff, the ML’s bindery, to look into the\npotential savings of using imitation gold (“oriental tissue”) instead of\ngenuine gold on the bindings, noting that it would have to save at least\na penny per book to make the change worthwhile (Klopfer to Bert Wolff,\n23 January 1930). Wolff indicated that imitation gold would save .003\nper copy or $3.00 per thousand—a savings of $1,500–1,800 a year (Wolff\nto Klopfer, 20 January 1930). As a test Klopfer asked that the ML’s May\ntitle, *Oriental Romances* (196), be stamped in imitation gold. Wolff\nmistakenly used imitation gold on the ML’s entire current binding order\nof 118,404 volumes instead of genuine gold as specified in the contract\n(RH Box 766, Wolff folder). Balloon cloth binding B2 with the\ntorchbearer blind stamped on the front panel appears to have been the\nsolution to the problem.\n\n**Library Edition**\n\nTwenty-five ML titles were offered in special bindings for the library\nmarket. The flexible balloon cloth bindings used for volumes sold in\nstores did not withstand repeated readings and thus were not well suited\nto library use. Volumes in the “Library Edition” were bound in sturdy\nblue buckram over stiff boards with headbands at the head and foot of\nthe spine. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings in the regular ML, the\nbindings were reinforced with mull, also known as crash—a strip of\nsturdy starched fabric that was glued over the folded gatherings at the\nspine, with flaps extending about half an inch on each side that were\nglued to the inside of the front and back boards. The titles were:\n\n*American Poetry* *1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology*, ed. Aiken\n(169.1)\n\nBeebe, *Jungle Peace* (116)\n\n*Best Ghost Stories* (67)\n\n*Best Russian Short Stories*, ed. Seltzer (18)\n\nBrontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120)\n\nCarroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass,\nThe Hunting of the Snark* (111)\n\nCellini, *Autobiography* (132)\n\nDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (171)\n\nDouglas, *South Wind* (114)\n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed. Starrett (155)\n\nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (21)\n\nHardy, *Return of the Native* (126)\n\nHudson, *Green Mansions* (90)\n\nIbsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People* (6)\n\nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (128)\n\nMelville, *Moby Dick* (124)\n\nMeredith, *Diana of the Crossways* (14)\n\nMeredith, *Ordeal of Richard Feverel* (144)\n\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154)\n\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (9)\n\nSchreiner, *Story of an African Farm* (142)\n\nSterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158)\n\nSymonds, *Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti* (164)\n\nWilde, *Picture of Dorian Gray* (1)\n\nWilde, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*\n(76)\n\nFifteen of the titles were ones that Cerf and Klopfer added between fall\n1925 and 1928; ten had originally appeared in the Boni & Liveright\nseries. The attempt to market ML books to libraries was not a success,\nprobably because the small size of the volumes and the narrow margins\ndid not allow for rebinding.\n\nBuckram bindings for the library market were again made available for\nmany ML titles in the 1960s, more than twenty years after the ML\nintroduced its larger format. This time the optional buckram bindings\nappear to have been successful. Rockwell Kent endpapers used in spring 1930 were available in three\ndifferent colors and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth\nbindings. Blue and green bindings continued to be paired with pale green\n(149) endpapers; brown bindings examined had light reddish brown (42)\nendpapers; and red bindings had endpapers in light orange (52).\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were in moderate orange (53).\nModerate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from\nfall 1930 through spring 1939, except for the oversize volume, John\nReed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935: 280) and three spring 1939\ntitles—Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317), Isak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic\nTales* (320), and *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTen of the 1930 titles were published in individually designed pictorial\njackets. Seven appeared in uniform typographic jacket D. Maugham, *Of\nHuman Bondage* (199) was published in uniform typographic jacket E;\nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (203) had a non-pictorial jacket designed\nby E. McKnight Kauffer. 95 cents. (Spring) Hemingway, *Sun Also Rises* xGoethe, *Faust*. (Fall) Goethe,\n*Faust* xConrad, *Lord Jim*. Cerf wanted to include John Galsworthy’s *Forsyte Saga* in the Modern\nLibrary but realized that Scribner’s was unlikely to grant reprint\nrights. He wrote Maxwell Perkins in 1930, “I eagerly await hearing of\nMr. Scribner’s reaction to my suggestion for the *Forsyte Saga*. I hope\nthat I did not move him to physical violence. I am convinced the idea is\nnot as ridiculous as it very likely appears at first blush” (Cerf to\nPerkins, 4 December 1930). Perkins replied that there was no possibility\nof granting reprint rights (Perkins to Cerf, 4 December 1930). Nine\nyears later Cerf offered an advance of $7,500 to publish *The Forsyte\nSaga* as a Giant (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939). Galsworthy’s\nsequence of three novels and two interludes never appeared in the ML.\n\nCerf contacted John W. Luce & Co. about rights to a John Millington\nSynge anthology (Cerf to Mr. Schaff, 23 June 1930). Cerf contacted\nLongman’s for the rights to H. Rider Haggard’s *She*, J. C. Van Dyke’s\n*History of Painting*, and G. F. Young’s history from 44 B.C. to 1453\nA.D., *East and West through Fifteen Centuries* (Cerf to J. Ray Beck, 25\nSeptember 1930). The only one of these titles that was ever added to the\nML was *She*—and that was over 25 years later, when Haggard’s *She &\nKing Solomon’s Mines* (492) appeared in the ML in 1957.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Goethe’s *Faust* and *The Sayings of Confucius* (Crowder to\nCerf, 12 April 1930 and 30 September 1930). *Faust* (200) was published\nin the ML that fall. *The Wisdom of Confucius* (312) appeared in the ML\nin 1938 and became one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. V. F.\nCalverton, who edited *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183)\nfor the ML in 1929, offered to edit *Tales of E. T. A. Hoffman* for the\nseries; Cerf indicated that the book was a possibility in the future\n(Cerf to Calverton, 10 December 1930).\n\nThe ML decided not to publish Guillaume Apollinaire’s *La Rome des\nBorgia* after a reader’s report judged it pornographic and valueless as\nhistory. The reader commented, “The whole simply stinks of obscenity and\nabnormality” (“Ray” to Klopfer, 18 February 1930).\n\nFerris Greenslet urged Cerf to publish a ML edition of Alain-Fournier’s\nnovel *The Wanderer* (*Le Grand Meaulnes*), which was originally\npublished in Paris in 1913 and appeared in an English translation\npublished by Houghton Mifflin in 1928, fourteen years after the young\nauthor’s death in action in the First World War. “I hope very much that\nyou are going to feel like doing something about THE WANDERER, both\nbecause we would like the business and because I personally have a\nprofound interest in extending the reputation of Alain Fournier”\n(Greenslet to Cerf, 5 September 1930). Cerf appears to have been\nskeptical about its sales potential. Roger L. Scaife, who would move\nfrom Houghton Mifflin to Little, Brown & Co. a short time later, replied\nto Cerf: “You may be right about THE WANDERER. The story took hold of us\nhere so strongly that we thought it a gem that should be preserved and\nsold year after year. Whether that is possible or not, I do not know.\nYour judgment is understandably better than mine in this case” (Scaife\nto Cerf, 6 October 1930). A new English translation by Frank Davison was\npublished in 1959 under the title *The Lost Domain* by Oxford University\nPress in its World’s Classics series and reprinted in Penguin Modern\nClassics as *Le Grand Meaulnes* in 1966. A third English translation by\nRobin Buss appeared in Penguin Classics in 2007 under the title *The\nLost Estate*.\n\nThe Marxist poet and novelist Isidor Schneider, who was in charge of\nadvertising at Horace Liveright, Inc., and whose wife, Helen Berlin, had\nbeen Cerf and Klopfer’s first secretary, recommended Ivan Goncharov’s\n*Oblomov* for the ML. The Natalie Duddington translation, published by\nMacmillan the previous year, was the first complete translation in\nEnglish. Schneider, who later served as literary editor of the *New\nMasses*, considered *Oblomov* one of the world’s ten best novels\n(Schneider to Cerf, 1 April 1930; Schneider Special Manuscript\nCollection, Columbia University Library). The Duddington translation was\npublished in Everyman’s Library in 1932, but *Oblomov* was never added\nin the ML.

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1931 1931 It took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest\nlevels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales\nfluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears\nto have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream\nbooks sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML\nsales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for\nSeptember 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s\nhistory up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of\nBooks,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).\n\nModern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to\ninclude works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to\naccommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in\nfall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1),\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3).\nThe Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm)\nwith hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the\nvolumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for\none dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were\nideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate\nsuccess.\n\nIn contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and\nKlopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint\ncollapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers\nfor their collections. One collector, whose library included a large\nnumber of Kelmscott Press books, including *The Works of Geoffrey\nChaucer*, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden\nCockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically\neverything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales\nrepresentatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was\nasked for suggestions, he could only reply, “I don’t know a soul who\nwants to buy a lot of press books today” (Carl Smalley to Cerf and\nKlopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933\nRandom House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of\nthe original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells’s *Time\nMachine* designed by W. A. Dwiggins ($12.50 list) was available for\n$2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne ($42.00 list)\nwas reduced to $10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides\n($85.00 list) was $15.00.\n\nCerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under\nthe Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for “specials”\nintended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML\nplates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on\ngood quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt\ntops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of $2.50. The\nventure was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title\nwere printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in\nmajor cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did\nnot do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that\nthey would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nRH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but\nthe books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML\nplates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50\ncents. Twenty-one titles were added to the regular ML in 1931 and five were\ndiscontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 198. Minor\ndiscrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on inside\npanels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including\ntitles projected for January publication on fall lists. The new ML\nGiants series was introduced in fall 1931 with three titles: Tolstoy,\n*War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo,\n*Les Misérables* (G3). All new titles except Conrad, *Lord Jim* (230) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Lord Jim* was 6⅞\nx 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm) with the leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in. (171 x\n113 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and torchbearer A2, A3, or A6 (see\nindividual entries). Beginning in January 1931 Cerf and Klopfer added\ntheir names to the imprint:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprints of three 1931 titles—Fielding, *History of Tom Jones*\n(208), Boccaccio, *Decameron* (209), and Balzac, *Droll Stories*\n(221)—differed from the standard format. *The History of Tom Jones* had\na colon instead of a dot between Cerf and Klopfer’s names; *The\nDecameron* and *Droll Stories* reverted to the two-line format without\nCerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding C, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and the 2-line imprint MODERN LIBRARY stamped\nin gold at the base of the spine, was used through April 1931. Balloon\ncloth binding D, with the front panel as binding C and the stylized\ninitials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine, was\nintroduced in May and remained in use through spring 1939.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings.\n\nThe Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation, which supplied some or all of the\nML’s balloon cloth, decided to liquidate. Holliston Mills, Inc., took\nover Siegbert’s stock, trademarks, and patent rights. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTwelve of the 1931 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Five were published in uniform typographic jacket D\nand three in uniform typographic jacket E. The individually designed\njacket of Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225) features the 2-line title\nsandwiched between six strong yellow green bands, simulating a barrel\nlabeled TONO BUNGAY. 95 cents. (Spring) Conrad, *Lord Jim* xBalzac, *Droll Stories*. (Fall) Balzac,\n*Droll Stories* xDreiser, *Sister Carrie*; Giants through G3. Cerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* in the ML, possibly as a\nreplacement for *Soldiers* *Three* which was dropped from the series in\n1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran\nwas not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17\nFebruary 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson\nDoubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. *Kim* (433) did not\nappear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams,\n*Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres*, the trade edition of which was\noriginally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there\nwas very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced\nedition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931).\nHerschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co.,\nasked why Gogol’s *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead\nSouls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to\nit. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf,\nundated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). *Dead Souls* (290) was\npublished in the ML in 1936.\n\nCerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur\nSchnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a\npotential replacement for Schnitzler’s novel *Bertha Garlan* (38) which\nwas discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a\ncollection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title *Little Novels* in\n1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or\nCerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* (256), published in April 1933, he included\nSchnitzler’s story “The Fate of the Baron” from the Simon and Schuster\ncollection.\n\nCerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon’s *Memoirs of a Fox Hunting\nMan*, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was\ninterested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML’s format,\nand he had reservations about Sassoon’s popularity in the United States.\nHe eventually declined: “Maybe something will come along to increase\nSassoon’s popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will\nallow us to reopen negotiations on this book” (Cerf to Coward, 10\nFebruary 1931; 9 July 1931).\n\nR. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested *Wolfgang Goethe*, a\ntwo-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML\nGiants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied,\n“Cheers! What a <u>lousy</u> idea” (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931;\nunderlining in original).\n\nWhen M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion\nof a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, “I have the very definite\nfeeling that ed. & Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of\nthe reprints of Mr. Bromfield’s books” (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October\n1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar & Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell’s\n*Moon-Calf*, *The Briary-Bush*, or *Janet March*, which were then the\nproperty of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, “I frankly don’t think\nthat Dell’s old books are read widely enough today to justify their\ninclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be\nbelonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I\nwrong?” (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22\nDecember 1931).

Modern Library sales\nfluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears\nto have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream\nbooks sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML\nsales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for\nSeptember 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s\nhistory up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of\nBooks,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).

Random\nHouse was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library,\nInc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933,\nfollowing the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer\nturned seriously to trade publishing.\n\nML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide\nexceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes\npublished in 1932 sold for $1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages\nper volume.\n\nThe ML published a full-page ad in *Publishers’ Weekly* that lampooned\nthe publishing industry adage, “You can’t sell books like soap.”\nAdapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed “They\nFloat!” and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with\nfive Modern Library books—*Of Human Bondage*, *Swann’s Way*, *The Magic\nMountain*, *Droll Stories*, and *Sanctuary*—floating on the surface of\nthe water (*PW*, 14 May 1932, p. 2015). Twenty-four titles were added and fifteen were discontinued, bringing\nthe number of titles in the regular ML to 207. Six of the discontinued\ntitles (two by Maupassant and four by Wilde) were repackaged as three\nvolumes to offer better value. Chekhov, *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other\nStories*, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more\ncomprehensive collection, *The Stories of Anton Tchekov*, edited by\nRobert Linscott). Three new titles in ML Giants, including Gibbon,\n*Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* in two volumes, brought the\nnumber of Giants to six titles in seven volumes. *Decline and Fall of\nthe Roman Empire* was expanded to three volumes in 1946.

Nearly all new titles published\nbetween 1932 and the introduction of the ML’s larger format in fall 1939\nhad pictorial jackets. Uniform typographic jacket D was used on newly\npublished titles for the last time in spring 1932. The final examples of\nits use, *Poems of Longfellow* (235) and Franklin, *Autobiography and\nSelections from His Other Writings* (236), provoked an angry letter from\nCerf, who had apparently given instructions that the jacket was no\nlonger to be used for new titles. 95 cents. (Spring) Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* xDickens, *Pickwick Papers*; Giants\nthrough G5. (Fall) Dickens, *Pickwick Papers* xLewis, *Arrowsmith*;\nGiants through G7. Cerf approached Arthur Pell at Liveright, Inc., about including a volume\nof plays by Eugene O’Neill in ML Giants (Cerf to Pell, 16 November\n1932). Nothing came of this initiative. O’Neill became a Random House\nauthor the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O’Neill’s\n*Nine Plays* (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added\nto the Giants in 1941.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens’s *Crock\nof Gold* (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs,\nthe president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the\npresident of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML\nreprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, “We\nare simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a\ncheap edition we would do it ourselves” (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).\n\nCerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge\nplays, saying “If we can’t get this from you by peaceable means in the\nnext two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston\nunderworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with\nlighted matches until you sign on the dotted line” (Cerf to Schaff, 16\nNovember 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to\n*Kim* (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to\nconsider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Edmund Wilson’s *Axel’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative\nLiterature of 1870–1930*, which had been published by Charles Scribner’s\nSons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with\nWilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested\nadding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed\npublishing under a new title such as *Literary Essays* or *Essays on\nModern Authors*. He also asked for an advance of $500 (Wilson to Cerf,\n28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays\nhe had considered adding to *Axel’s Castle* into a new book (Wilson to\nCerf, 6 November 1933).\n\nDale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a\none-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm\nof Albert & Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes\ncomprising Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, would welcome some\nready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in\n1930, and the firm “was in major trouble” by the early 1930s (“Albert\nand Charles Boni” in *American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980*,\np. 57).\n\nThe ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, *Swann’s Way* (1928)\nand *Within a Budding Grove* (1930), and would add *Guermantes Way* in\n1933. Cerf thought that Warren’s suggestion was an excellent idea except\nfrom the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked\nWarren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris\nGreenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. “We\nhave had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire\nProust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might\nbe able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that\nanything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as\npossible. Something <u>must</u> break in this situation before the\nsummer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining\nin original). Five months later he indicated, “I have not given up hopes\nof buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything\ndevelops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you\nimmediately” (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure\n*Remembrance of Things Past* a year or so later. The Random House\nedition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf\ndescribed it as “one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934” (Cerf,\n*At Random*, p. 99).\n\nWarren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of\nProust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but\nadded that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust\nif the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather’s *My Antonia*,\nwhich he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to\nWarren, 13 September 1943).

The change of name to Horace Liveright, Inc., was largely due to\nconfusion with the firm, Albert & Charles Boni, which the Boni brothers\nestablished in 1923.\n\nLiveright borrowed money repeatedly from Arthur Pell, the firm’s\ntreasurer, giving him stock in the firm as collateral. By 1930 he had\nlost control of the firm of which he had been co-founder. When Pell\nemerged as the firm’s majority shareholder he forced Liveright to leave.\nLiveright moved to Hollywood where he worked briefly at Paramount and\nthen Pathé Studios before returning to New York in the summer of 1931,\nwhere he died two years later at the age of forty-nine. In December 1931\nPell changed the name of the firm to Liveright, Inc. Pell did what he\ncould to avert the slide into bankruptcy, but on 4 May 1933 three of its\ncreditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the firm\n(Gilmer, pp. 232-33). Other publishers rushed in to sign up the leading\nLiveright authors. Robinson Jeffers received thirteen telegrams from\npublishers the day the bankruptcy was announced (Melrich V. Rosenberg to\nCerf, 17 September 1933). Even more sought after was Eugene O’Neill,\nwhose plays, Cerf once noted, “sold like novels” (Gelb and Gelb, p.\n768). Cerf set out to get both authors, though he thought the odds\nagainst getting O’Neill were about fifteen to one (Cerf to Crowder, 23\nMay 1933).\n\nO’Neill relied on his friend Saxe Commins, who had recently become his\neditor at Liveright, to advise him on the choice of a new publisher.\nAfter examining the offers, Commins indicated a preference for Cerf and\nRandom House. As he explained later,\n\n> The reason for the choice was that I had known Bennett professionally\n> during the Liveright days and recognized in him the potential of an\n> imaginative, resourceful, adventurous and most trustworthy publisher.\n> From my first meeting with his partner, Donald S. Klopfer, I was\n> impressed by his quiet confidence, his reliability, and his good\n> sense. Subsequently . . . I was to learn of his many attributes, not\n> the least of which is his complete selflessness (Commins, quoted in\n> Dorothy Commins, *What Is an Editor?*, p. 26).\n\nCerf was invited to fly down to Sea Island, Georgia, to meet with\nO’Neill and Commins. O’Neill signed with Random House in June; Jeffers\nsigned a day or so later. One of the first acts of the reorganized\nLiveright Publishing Corporation was to deliver the plates of its books\nby O’Neill and Jeffers to the ML’s printers (Liveright Publishing, Inc.,\nto the Modern Library, Inc., 9 August 1933; reproduced in Egleston, pp.\n107–08).\n\nCerf and Klopfer also considered trying to get Theodore Dreiser, the\nmost important novelist on the Liveright list. After O’Neill and Jeffers\nsigned with Random House Klopfer composed a letter to Dreiser making an\noffer, but the letter, dated 20 June 1933, appears never to have been\nsent. The original as well as the carbon copy remains in the Random\nHouse Collection at Columbia University. One can only speculate why Cerf\nand Klopfer changed their minds. Cerf did not like Dreiser personally,\nand Dreiser was a notoriously difficult author to deal with. He\ndistrusted publishers in general and Jewish publishers in particular. In\nthe end, over a year after the Liveright bankruptcy, he signed with\nSimon and Schuster. He completed nothing of importance during the eight\nacrimonious years he remained with the firm. By 1939 he owed Simon and\nSchuster over ten thousand dollars in unearned advances and other\ncharges (Madison, p. 108).\n\nIn addition to O’Neill and Jeffers, Random House acquired the editorial\nservices of Saxe Commins. One of O’Neill’s conditions for coming to\nRandom House was that his editor come with him. Random House needed a\nfull-time editor if it was to become seriously involved in trade\npublishing, and Commins was developing into one of the best book editors\nof his generation. Already the editor of Eugene O’Neill, at Random House\nhe was to become renowned as the editor of William Faulkner and also of\nW. H. Auden, Isak Dinesen, Sinclair Lewis, James Michener, Budd\nSchulberg, Irwin Shaw, Stephen Spender, and many others. Commins started\nat Random House on 9 July 1933 and remained editor-in-chief until his\ndeath in 1958, a quarter of a century later.\n\nAfter merging two volumes by Maupassant into one and four volumes by\nWilde into two in 1932, the ML continued its efforts to make ML books a\nbetter value by adding *Erewhon Revisited* to its edition of Samuel\nButler’s *Erewhon* (146b). Thirteen new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of titles in the regular ML to 211. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants series; by the end of 1933 the Giants included\neleven titles in twelve volumes. All new titles except Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (254) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Arrowsmith* was ⅜\ninch taller and wider to accommodate the Harcourt, Brace plates.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type; torchbearer A2 was used on all but two new\ntitles. Ludwig, *Napoleon* (255) had torchbearer A7 and Louÿs,\n*Aphrodite* (257) had torchbearer C2. All new titles had the 3-line\nimprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprint of Louÿs, *Aphrodite* (257) differs from other 1933 titles\nin the first line of the imprint, which has a colon rather than a dot\nbetween Cerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll newly published titles had individually designed pictorial jackets\nexcept Gertrude Stein’s *Three Lives* (261) which had a distinctive\nnon-pictorial jacket designed by Ernst Reichl. Reichl was also\nresponsible for designing the Random House edition of Joyce’s *Ulysses*,\npublished in January 1934.\n\nBeginning in August with Brontë, *Jane Eyre* (160), descriptive text\nabout the work replaced generic information about the series on the\nfront jacket flaps of newly published ML titles. The flap text was\nwritten by Saxe Commins, who joined the firm as editor in July. 95 cents. (Spring) Lewis, *Arrowsmith* xStein, *Three Lives*; Giants through G10.\n(Fall) Stein, *Three Lives* xCaldwell, *God’s Little Acre*; Giants\nthrough G12; jackets: 225 (=spring, fall 1934). Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include George Bernard Shaw’s plays in the ML\nand offered Dodd, Mead a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy for a volume consisting of *Man and Superman*, *St. Joan*, and\n*Androcles and the Lion* (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 8 February 1933). Shaw\nopposed inexpensive reprints of his works and kept tight control of his\ncopyrights, and it was only after his death in 1950 that the ML was able\nto include two volumes of his plays. (Shaw temporarily relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints in 1946, when he allowed Penguin Books to\npublish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of\n100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.) The only\nwork by Shaw that appeared in the ML during his lifetime was his early\nnovel, *An Unsocial Socialist* (15), which was published before the U.S.\nextended copyright protection to the works of foreign authors.\n\nWilla Cather was another author who was ambivalent about inexpensive\nreprints of her works. She allowed *Death Comes to the Archbishop* (219)\nto be included in the Modern Library in 1931 but subsequently asked\nKnopf not to renew the reprint contract. When Cerf tried to add Cather’s\n*My Antonia* to the series in 1933 Houghton Mifflin turned him down,\nprobably at Cather’s request (Dale Warren to Cerf, 30 October 1933).\n\nCerf contacted Farrar and Rinehart about including Hervey Allen’s\n*Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants in 1935 or 1936 (Cerf to John Farrar, 11\nAugust 1933). The historical novel sold 300,000 copies in its first six\nmonths and led the fiction best-seller list for two years (1933‑1934).\nFarrar and Rinehart does not appear to have authorized any reprint\nedition, not even by Grosset & Dunlap, the leading publisher of reprint\neditions for the mass market before the advent of paperbacks in 1939.\nCerf waited for five years and tried again in 1938 (see 1938 Titles\nsought, suggested, declined).\n\nCerf expressed interest in reprinting Ogden Nash’s selection from P. G.\nWodehouse’s works, *Nothing but Wodehouse* (Doubleday, Doran, 1932),\npossibly as a Giant—the volume ran to more than 1,000 pages—but\nDoubleday, Doran was reprinting it in a cheap edition of their own.\n\nOn a different note, Klopfer asked Max Eastman, whose Marx’s *Capital,\nThe Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings* (246) had been published in\nthe ML three months earlier, to translate the complete works of Lenin\nfor the ML, noting that it would be “a perfect follow-up book for the\nMarx” and “would create a great feeling of ill-will in this country, all\nof which we are very much for.” Five days later he wrote, “I am waiting\nwith baited breath to hear the length of the complete works of Lenin,\nwhen you would be able to do it, and how much you would want to do a new\ntranslation” (Klopfer to Eastman, 16 February and 21 February 1933).\nEastman replied that a volume of Lenin could be any length. He asked for\nan advance of five hundred dollars and a fee of one cent per word for\nthe translation. He noted, “Lenin’s style is an extraordinary\nphenomenon—you can feel the locomotive force of the man’s will in almost\nevery sentence—and it has never been reproduced in English” (Eastman to\nKlopfer, 16 March 1933). Klopfer responded that the ML would like a book\nof about 100,000 words (Klopfer to Eastman, 17 March 1933).\n\nEastman received the advance he asked for, but nearly a year went by\nbefore he began working on the Lenin book. Cerf wrote in April 1934,\n“These are times in which that book could sell marvelously well, and it\nwould be a shame to dilly-dally until somebody beats us to the gun. I\nbeseech you to get to work on it” (Cerf to Eastman, 4 April 1934). But\nEastman made little progress. Other work got in the way, and in August\nhe wrote to Cerf agreeing to an annulment of the contract. Eastman kept\nthe advance, which they agreed would be regarded as an advance for a\nfuture project (Eastman to Cerf, 30 August 1934). Cerf and Klopfer gave\nup the idea of including a Lenin volume in the ML. The only subsequent\nbook of Eastman’s to be published by Random House was *Love and\nRevolution: My Journey through an Epoch* (1964)*.*\n\nRobert de Graff, the president of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary\nGarden City Publishing Co., suggested Clemence Dane’s novel *Legend* for\nthe ML. Dane was the pseudonym of the English novelist, playwright, and\nscreenwriter Winifred Ashton. Cerf replied that he didn’t think she\nwould have much of a sale in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 27 January 1933;\nCerf to de Graff, 30 January 1933). Michael S. Mill, a publisher’s sales\nrepresentative, suggested a volume of Anthony Trollope; Cerf replied\nthat the ML would get around to it in the next couple of years (Cerf to\nMill, 28 July 1933). Trollope’s *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (292)\nwas added to the ML in 1936.\n\nFollowing the publication of Keats and Shelley’s *Complete Poetical\nWorks* (G4) in the new ML Giants series, Cerf and Klopfer considered a\nGiant devoted to the complete poems of Lord Byron. Robert Linscott of\nHoughton Mifflin Co. provided sales figures for the firm’s Cambridge\nEdition of *The Complete Poetical Works* *of Lord Byron* (1905). Trade\nsales for the three-year period 1930–32 totaled 1370 copies. Klopfer\nthanked him and noted, “I think that that conclusively proves we would\nnot be warranted in making a Giant of a complete Byron” (Klopfer to\nLinscott, 13 April 1933). The ML published Byron’s *Don Juan* (420) in\n1949 and *Selected Poetry* (465) in 1954.

For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles,\nlike ‘Droll Stories’ or ‘The Decameron,’ was on the list. Most\ninteresting was the popularity of ‘Selected Writings of Karl Marx,’\nedited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is\nstill selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.” The ten best sellers\nfor the year were: Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*, Faulkner,\n*Sanctuary*, Marx, *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other\nWritings*, Lawrence, *Sons and Lovers*, Maugham, *Of Human Bondage*,\nMann, *The Magic Mountain*, Merejkowski, *The Romance of Leonardo da\nVinci*, Dostoyevsky, *The Brothers Karamazov*, Cather, *Death Comes for\nthe Archbishop*, and Rostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (“Modern Library Best\nSellers,” *PW*, 13 January 1934, p. 148).

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1934 1934 Cerf and Klopfer published the first authorized American edition of\nJames Joyce’s *Ulysses* in January 1934. The book appeared under the\nRandom House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The\nModern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of\nthe firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back\ncopies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and\nCompany, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate\nSylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and\ntourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at\ncustoms.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell\n*Ulysses* before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of\nthe Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the\nwork bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to\nbe seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court,\nSouthern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and\nattorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random\nHouse. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized\nthe literary stature of *Ulysses* and concluded that “nowhere does it\ntend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into\nthe United States was overturned.\n\nThe Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey’s decision, a foreword\nby Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at\n$3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH\nedition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over\n$30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). *Ulysses* (G50) was\nadded to ML Giants in 1940.\n\nOther trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint\nincluded a four-volume edition of Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*,\nGertrude Stein’s *Four Saints in Three Acts*, volumes of poetry by W. H.\nAuden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play\n*Merrily We Roll Along*, and William Saroyan’s *Daring Young Man on the\nFlying Trapeze*.\n\n**Printing technologies: letterpress and offset lithography**\n\nAll ML books before 1934 appear to have been printed from letterpress\nplates. Letterpress is a relief technology. The printing surface is\nraised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal,\nLinotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which\nis cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface\nis inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates\ncast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the\nnineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than\none printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of\nstanding type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was\na metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each\npage allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways,\ndepending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or\nthirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early\n1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was\nlikely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus\nsaving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher\nanticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The\nML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings.\nAll ML books were printed from plates.\n\nWhen the ML reprinted copyrighted works it tried whenever possible to\nuse the original publisher’s letterpress plates or duplicates of the\noriginal plates. The original plates were usually designed for a\nfull-sized trade edition, not the ML’s compact format. This explains why\nmany ML books printed from the original publisher’s plates had\nuncomfortably narrow margins. In some cases the only way the ML could\nprint from the original publisher’s plates was to cut off the running\nheads, as it did with Anatole France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163). The\nintroduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 enhanced the appearance\nof ML books and made it easier to print from original publishers’\nplates.\n\nOffset lithography is a planographic technology where the printing area\nof a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed\ninto the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and\netching). A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is\nbased on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a\nlithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink;\nnon-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink.\nOffset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to\nbe printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a\npreviously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed\nfrom metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of\nletterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed\nsheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the\nnumber of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives\nare placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The\nplate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts\ndifferently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the\nprinting and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing\npossible” (Marshall Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2d ed., 1979, p. 132).\nLetterpress printing typically involves a separate plate for each page;\noffset plates typically print an entire side of a sheet at a time.\nModern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates\nfor each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant\nprinting methodology, some printers appear to have stored the\nlithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates\nwere stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic\nprinting were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not\nuntil the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by\nthis method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a\nmajor book-printing industry” (p. 136).\n\nUnlike relief plates, lithographic plates are lightweight and flexible.\nThey are attached to one cylinder of the printing press. The plate is\ntreated so that the printing areas accept greasy printer’s ink and repel\nwater. In the press, the plate is coated with a thin film of water,\nwhich prevents ink from adhering to non-printing areas; another roller\napplies printer’s ink which adheres to the images to be printed.\n\nLithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or\n“offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed\ndirectly to paper. The inked image is “offset” to a second cylinder\ncovered with a rubber blanket which in turn transfers the image to paper\ncarried by a third cylinder. Lee indicates in *Bookmaking: The\nIllustrated Guide to Design/Production/Editing* (2nd ed., 1979),\n“Several advantages are gained by printing on a rubber blanket first\ninstead of directly on paper: (a) the plates last longer, (b) less water\ncomes in contact with the paper, (c) the resilient rubber cylinder\npermits printing finer copy on rougher paper, and (d) the speed is\nincreased” (p. 137).\n\nSince letterpress printing transfers ink directly from relief plates or\nstanding type to paper, the type surface is wrong reading so that the\nprinted image will be right reading. The extra step in offset\nlithography means that lithographic plates are right reading and can be\nread in the same way that a printed page is read. The inked image on the\noffset cylinder is wrong reading, and the image transferred to paper is\nright reading.\n\nThe ML occasionally resorted to offset lithography before the 1960s when\nthe original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the ML’s\nformat. At that period offset lithography was more expensive than\nletterpress printing and the quality was considered to be inferior, but\nit allowed the ML to avoid the cost of a new typesetting. The ML could\nphotograph the pages of a printed book, reduce the dimensions of the\ntype page photographically, and make offset plates from the negatives.\n\nThe first ML book printed by offset lithography appears to have been\nFrank Norris’s *The Pit* (272), published in August 1934. Parkway\nPrinting Co., the ML’s regular printers, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955, and the ML had the book printed by Polygraphic\nPrinting Co. of America, a New York shop that specialized in offset\nlithography. Other ML titles printed from offset lithographic plates\nbefore the mid-1960s include Newton, *Amenities of Book Collecting*\n(1935: 287), Malraux, *Man’s Fate* (1936: 294), Whitman, *Leaves of\nGrass* (1940: G48), Bemelmans, *My War with the United States* (1941:\n343), and Thurber, *The Thurber Carnival* (1957: 496). The introduction\nof the ML’s larger format in 1939 allowed later printings of *Man’s\nFate* to be made from the original publisher’s letterpress plates.\n*Man’s Fate* was the only ML title printed in succession from offset\nplates, letterpress plates, and then again from offset plates when the\nML switched to offset lithographic printing for most of its titles in\nthe mid 1960s.\n\nThe cost of printing by offset lithography dropped below that of\nletterpress printing around 1963. Over the next few years the ML\nconverted most of its books to offset. Today nearly all commercially\npublished books are printed by offset lithography, and letterpress\nprinting is largely confined to small presses that print books in\nlimited editions from handset type.\n\nSeveral ML books published in the “reissue” format in the 1980s reverted\nto letterpress printing, presumably to capture price breaks for using\nidle letterpress equipment after most book publishers had switched to\noffset lithography. Some of these were printed from letterpress plates\nthat were worn and battered from decades of use; the appearance of these\nbooks is distinctly inferior to those printed from offset plates. When\nthe ML switched to offset printing in the mid-1960s, it tried to\nphotograph first ML printings or the earliest printings it could find in\norder to avoid worn type. Thirteen new titles were added and twelve were discontinued, bringing\nthe number of titles in the regular ML to 212. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants; by the end of 1934 the Giants included sixteen\ntitles in seventeen volumes. All new titles were published in the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format in\nballoon cloth binding D with the Kent endpaper in orange. Each title was\navailable in red, blue, green, and brown cloth with the top edge stained\nthe same color as the binding. All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and torchbearer A2. All new titles had the\n3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S.

Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World*\n(1935) and three spring 1939 titles, all of which were published in the\nlarger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning fall 1939. An\nenlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940.

(Fall) Heyward, *Porgy*\nxHamsun, *Growth of the Soil*; Giants through G17; jackets: 225 (=fall\n1933, spring 1934). *Note:* Titles scheduled for January publication\nwere printed late in the preceding year; ML lists inside the jackets and\nat the end of the volumes are typically those of the preceding fall. Cerf made another attempt to secure James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* for\nthe ML (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 19 March 1934). Six years\nearlier Macmillan had turned down an advance of $4,000 against royalties\nof 12 cents a copy—more than the ML paid for all but a select handful of\ntitles. *The Crock of Gold* was still selling too well in its original\nAmerican edition for Macmillan to consider a reprint. It never appeared\nin the ML.\n\nLittle, Brown turned down an offer by Cerf to reprint *Mutiny on the\nBounty* by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Alfred R. McIntyre of\nLittle, Brown indicated that he doubted if anyone would be allowed to\npublish an inexpensive reprint of the book (Cerf to McIntyre, 20 July\n1934; McIntyre to Cerf, 23 July 1934). Cerf was undeterred and made\noffers for the *Bounty* trilogy.\n\nCerf was also beginning to think about a book on Judaism. He wrote to\nArnold Zweig soliciting his suggestions for the series and indicated,\n“In particular, I would like to do some history of the Jews in the\nModern Library. Have you any suggestions along this line?” (Cerf to\nZweig, 24 July 1934). He repeated his interest two years later in a\nletter to Harold Guinzburg of Viking Press (Cerf to Guinzburg, 3 March\n1936). It took twenty years for this goal to be accomplished. Two books\non Judaism compiled for Random House, *The Wisdom of Israel*, edited by\nLewis Browne (1945) and *Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People*,\nedited by Leo W. Schwarz (1956) were reprinted in ML Giants in 1956 and\n1962.\n\nDale Warren of Houghton Mifflin Co. suggested a ML edition of Dorothy\nRichardson’s *Pilgrimage*, the lengthy novel sequence published in the\nU.S. by Alfred A. Knopf. He noted that “the whole stream of\nconsciousness business was really started by Dorothy Richardson” and\nadded, “I should think you could buy the rights for a song, and get some\nsale—although you would of course be making one of those superb gestures\nfor which the Cerf-Klopfer twins are justly noted” (Warren to Cerf, 30\nJanuary 1934). Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when\nhe was in Boston in September. “My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin\nhave a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are\ntrying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like\nourselves” (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934).\n\nAaron Sussman of Spier & Sussman, the ML’s advertising agency, suggested\na complete edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes’s *Breakfast Papers*\n(Sussman to Cerf, 14 November 1934). Cerf replied, “We steered clear of\nHolmes and his pals as far as the Modern Library is concerned because\nwe’ve had such rotten luck with Franklin and Longfellow volumes. It\nmakes me believe that people who want this sort of thing are not\ninclined to look for it in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Sussman, 15\nNovember 1934). Sales of *The Poems of Longfellow* (235) and *The\nAutobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other\nWritings* (236) improved in the 1940s and 1950s, when Longfellow ranked\nin the first quarter of ML and Giant titles and Franklin ranked in the\nsecond quarter.

The book appeared under the\nRandom House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The\nModern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of\nthe firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back\ncopies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and\nCompany, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate\nSylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and\ntourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at\ncustoms.

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1936 1936 The most important step in Random House’s growth as a trade publisher\ncame in 1936 when Cerf and Klopfer acquired the publishing firm Harrison\nSmith and Robert K. Haas. Smith and Haas had been in business for just\nover five years, but both men had solid experience in publishing. Smith\nhad been an editor at Harcourt, Brace & Co., where one of his authors\nwas Sinclair Lewis. Shortly before the Wall Street crash he joined the\nEnglish publisher Jonathan Cape in establishing the firm Jonathan Cape\nand Harrison Smith in New York. He left that firm in October 1931 to go\ninto business with Haas, who had been a founder of the Book-of-the-Month\nClub and served as its president for five years. Smith and Haas\npublished many important books, but the early 1930s was a difficult time\nto launch a new publishing firm and Smith and Haas remained financially\ninsecure. When Cerf and Klopfer suggested a merger with Random House\nthey agreed. Haas recalled the circumstances as follows:\n\n> We had a small, but I think extraordinarily distinguished, list. We\n> did everything but make money. We were not quite in the black, but it\n> was coming; we had been doing better each year. . . . Then one day\n> Bennett Cerf who had been an acquaintance, although not an intimate\n> friend, of mine for some years . . . asked if we would consider\n> merging with them, because they were anxious to get a list of trade\n> books. . . . That appealed to me very much because I thought the\n> Modern Library was the finest list of books of its kind in the whole\n> world (Haas interview, “The Book-of-the-Month Club,” Oral History\n> Research Office, Columbia University, 1954–55, pp. 963–64).\n\nThe merger gave Random House a ready-made trade list that included such\nauthors as William Faulkner, Isak Dinesen, André Malraux, Robert Graves,\nMaurice Hindus, Edgar Snow, and Louis Fischer. It also gave Random House\na children’s department under the direction of Louise Bonino and a\nchildren’s list that included Jean de Brunhoff’s Babar books.\n\nThe firm’s corporate name changed from The Modern Library, Inc., to\nRandom House, Inc. The Modern Library became a subsidiary of its\noffspring. Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners of Random\nHouse. Cerf was president, Haas was vice-president, Klopfer was\ntreasurer, and Smith was secretary. Cerf described the reorganization in\na letter to Gertrude Stein:\n\n> The actual structure of the new firm leaves one-third of the business\n> belonging to me, one-third to Donald, and the other one-third to be\n> divided between the two new partners. This means, of course, that in a\n> pinch we will always be running the show. As a matter of fact,\n> however, both of the new partners are not only very charming men, but\n> are extremely competent and highly regarded by the publishing world. I\n> am absolutely sure that everything will work out beautifully (Cerf to\n> Stein, 28 February 1936, Random House Collection).\n\nThe transition is documented in the title leaves of ML books published\nbetween January and May 1936. January and February titles include Cerf\nand Klopfer’s names on the title page as part of the imprint; beginning\nin March Cerf and Klopfer’s names are omitted from the imprint. Original\nML introductions are copyrighted under the name The Modern Library,\nInc., through April. Beginning in May 1936 Random House, Inc., becomes\nthe copyright holder, and the names of all four owners are recorded on\nthe verso of the title page (see examples under “Title Page” below).\n\nSmith remained at Random House for less than a year. The firm did not\nneed a fourth partner, and Smith had a flair for forgetting dates and\nlosing manuscripts that Cerf found irritating (Cerf, *At Random*, p.\n123). He once described Smith as “the only man who ever mislaid six\nmanuscripts simultaneously in the same desk” (Cerf, “Trade Winds,”\n*Saturday Review of Literature*, 18 April 1942, p. 20). When Smith\nresigned as of 1 January 1937 he commented, “I have discovered that the\ncombined staff of both houses was so completely and fully manned on the\neditorial side that it did not leave enough active work for me in the\nfuture” (Harrison Smith to Fletcher Pratt, 30 December 1936, Random\nHouse Collection). He later became the publisher of *Saturday Review of\nLiterature*.\n\nAfter Smith’s departure Cerf, Klopfer and Haas each owned one-third of\nRandom House and the Modern Library. Haas, who was eight years older\nthan Cerf and twelve years older than Klopfer, remained an active\npartner until his retirement in 1956.\n\nThe acquisition of Smith and Haas was the second of three events in the\n1930s that were of major importance in the development of Random House\nas a trade publisher. The first was the acquisition of Eugene O’Neill\nand the hiring of Saxe Commins as editor in 1933 after the bankruptcy of\nLiveright, Inc. The third was the arrival of Lewis Miller in August\n1936.\n\nMiller came to Random House from Garden City Publishing Co., the\nDoubleday reprint subsidiary, where he had been sales manager and played\nan important role in the success of the firm’s full-sized reprints, Star\nDollar Books. He moved to Random House to develop a reprint line under\nthe resurrected Carlton House imprint, but that venture was unsuccessful\nand in January 1938 he became sales manager for Random House and the\nModern Library. He was one of the best sales managers in the business\nand it was in that capacity that he played a major role in the\ndevelopment of Random House. He remained with the firm until his\nretirement in 1967. Klopfer once stated that Miller was “responsible for\nRandom House being as big a firm as it was” (Klopfer, interview with\nGBN, 1 June 1977). Ten new titles were added and ten titles were discontinued. The number\nof titles in the regular ML remained stable at 213, making 1936 the\nfirst year in which the number of titles in the regular series did not\nincrease. Six new titles were published in ML Giants series, bringing\nthe Giants to twenty-eight titles in thirty volumes. All new titles except Glasgow, *Barren Ground* (289) and James,\n*Portrait of a Lady* (291) were published in the standard format with\nthe binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed\nto 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Barren Ground* was ¼ inch taller and\nwider to accommodate the Doubleday, Doran plates; *Portrait of a Lady*\nwas ¼ inch taller to accommodate the Houghton, Mifflin plates. All new\ntitles were published in balloon cloth binding D with the Kent endpaper\nin orange. Each title was available in red, blue, green, and brown cloth\nwith the top edge stained the same color as the binding.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm).

All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type; six title pages had torchbearer A2 and four\nhad torchbearer A3.

An\nenlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The\ncentral panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the\nsurrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to\nfill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll but three 1936 titles except were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Dostoyevsky, *The Possessed* (288), James, *Portrait\nof a Lady* (291), and James, *Varieties of Religious Experience* (296)\nwere published in individually designed non-pictorial jackets. The front\nflap of each jacket included descriptive text about the work written by\nSaxe Commins. 95 cents. (Spring) Gogol, *Dead Souls* xMalraux, *Man’s Fate*; Giants through G27;\njackets: 242.

Two years after Little, Brown rejected his earlier offer to include\n*Mutiny on the Bounty* in the ML, Cerf tried again to secure reprint\nrights to the novel. By this time the second and third volumes of\nCharles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall’s Bounty trilogy—*Men Against the\nSea* and *Pitcairn’s Island—*had been published, and the motion picture\nversion of *Mutiny on the Bounty* starring Charles Laughton and Clark\nGable had been released. Cerf offered a $2,500 advance against royalties\nof 10 cents a copy for a ML edition to be published in spring 1937. He\nwrote, “We have discovered that by putting the first volumes of the\nProust set in the Modern Library, we have boosted the sale of the\ncomplete set enormously, and I honestly believe that by making *Mutiny\non the Bounty* available to a new audience, you would find the sales of\nthe trilogy increased in exactly the same manner” (Cerf to Alfred\nMcIntyre, Little, Brown, 5 October 1936). Little, Brown was not\npersuaded.\n\nAnother popular book for which the ML was unable to get reprint rights\nwas Ralph Roeder’s *Man of the Renaissance*, which had been published by\nViking Press in 1933 (Haas to Marshall Best, Viking Press, 14 September\n1936).\n\nAlfred McIntyre of Little, Brown suggested a ML edition of\nLouis-Ferdinand Céline’s *Journey to the End of Night* (McIntyre to\nCerf, 10 February 1936), but the Little, Brown edition was nearly two\ninches taller than the ML’s format and the original plates could not\nhave been used. Cerf responded, “Under ordinary circumstances, I would\nbe strongly inclined to add the book to the regular Modern Library\nseries because I think it is good enough for it, but the plate\ndifficulty seems insurmountable” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 March 1936). It\nwould have been possible to photograph the Little, Brown edition, reduce\nthe type page photographically, and print by offset lithography—as New\nDirections did for at least some paperback printings of *Journey to the\nEnd of Night* three or four decades later—but in the 1930s offset\nlithography was more expensive than letterpress printing, the quality\nwas not as good, and the ML resorted to it reluctantly. Céline’s novel\nnever appeared in the ML.\n\nRoss G. Baker of Bobbs-Merrill suggested Robert Nathan’s *Woodcutter’s\nHouse*, which the firm had published in 1927. Cerf replied, “We\ndiscussed this book several times before . . . and decided that it is\nnot sufficiently popular to warrant its inclusion in the series, despite\nits obvious merit. It is true that Knopf is doing a great deal of\nballyhoo for Nathan these days, but unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to\nbe doing very much for his older titles” (Cerf to Baker, 4 August 1936).\n\nRaymond Healy, who had been hired in 1935 as the ML’s sales\nrepresentative on the West Coast, suggested that the ML publish a\ncookbook. Cerf replied, “We <u>have</u> thought of putting a cookbook in\nthe Modern Library, but decided that we had better stick more to the\nliterary line . . . and let people like Blue Ribbon and Star Dollar do\ncookbooks and the like” (Cerf to Healy, 3 April 1936; underlining in\noriginal). Around the same time Healy reported that “the trade is now\nasking us for an Emerson in the Modern Library. Personally, I think the\nold Gent was a stick in the mud but I relay the request to you anyhow”\n(Healy to Cerf, 6 April 1936). The ML published Emerson’s *Complete\nEssays and Other Writings* (334) in 1940. Dostoyevsky, *The Possessed* (1936) 288\n\nGlasgow, *Barren Ground* (1936) 289\n\nGogol, *Dead Souls* (1936) 290\n\nJames, *Portrait of a Lady* (1936) 291\n\nTrollope, *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (1936–1940); *Barchester\nTowers & The Warden* (1940– ) 292\n\nHorace, *Complete Works* (1936) 293\n\nMalraux, *Man’s Fate* (1936) 294\n\nRichardson, *Maurice Guest* (1936) 295\n\nJames, *Varieties of Religious Experience* (1936) 296\n\nThackeray, *History of Henry Esmond* (1936) 297 The most important step in Random House’s growth as a trade publisher\ncame in 1936 when Cerf and Klopfer acquired the publishing firm Harrison\nSmith and Robert K.

Cerf sought several titles in 1937 for which the original publishers\nwere unwilling to grant reprint rights. Little, Brown rejected Cerf’s\noffer for a ML edition of Emily Dickinson’s poetry (Alfred R. McIntyre,\nLittle, Brown & Co., to Cerf, 26 May 1937). Houghton Mifflin declined an\noffer to add *The Rise of Silas Lapham* by William Dean Howells (Cerf to\nRobert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 18 October 1937; Linscott to Klopfer,\n4 January 1938). The ML was able to publish *Selected Poetry of Emily\nDickinson* (410) in 1948 and *The Rise of Silas Lapham* (442) in 1951.\n\nCerf decided not to publish a ML edition of Thomas Wolfe’s *Of Time and\nthe River* (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 21 October 1937).

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1938 1938 The spring 1938 RH catalogue was indicative of the growing importance of\nRH’s trade list. It included Isak Dineson’s *Out of Africa*, William\nFaulkner’s *Unvanquished*, Robert Graves’s *Count Belisarius*, Edgar\nSnow’s *Red Star Over China*, and John Strachey’s *What is to be Done?*\nOther titles included *The Public Papers* and *Addresses of Franklin D.\nRoosevelt* in five volumes and *The Complete Greek Drama*, a two-volume\nset in the Lifetime Library, a series of mainly ancient classics that\nbegan the previous year with *The Complete Dialogues of Plato*.\n\nIt was a list that even other publishers found impressive. Albert Knopf\nwrote to Cerf: “I have just been looking over with admiration and\nrespect your new catalogue. You are publishing a lot of interesting\nbooks and building on a solid foundation” (Knopf to Cerf, 26 January\n1938). Philip Van Doren Stern of Simon & Schuster was equally impressed,\nand perhaps a bit envious (Stern to Cerf, 26 January 1938).\n\n> I want to congratulate you on your really magnificent list.

You will certainly have a successful year with books like\n> these and you are building up a backlist that will give your house a\n> solid foundation of real honest-to-God titles in the years to come. .\n> . .\n>\n> P.S. This is no Dale Carnegie crap \\[*How to Win Friends and Influence\n> People*, then enjoying a huge success, was a Simon & Schuster\n> publication.\\] I mean every word of it. Eight new titles were added and five were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of titles in the regular ML to 219. Five new titles were\npublished in the Giants series; by the end of 1938 ML Giants included\nforty titles in forty-two volumes. All new titles in the regular ML except Walter D. Edmonds, *Rome Haul*\n(310) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring\n6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107\nmm). *Rome Haul* was ¼ in. taller and wider to accommodate the Little,\nBrown plates.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in fall 1939. The new binding\nmeasured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177\nx 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with\nthe binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in.

All new titles in the regular ML had the final version of Elmer Adler’s\ntitle page with the title in open-face type; four had torchbearer A2 and\nfour had torchbearer A3. All new titles had the 2-line imprint:\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World*\n(1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger\nformat that the ML adopted for all titles beginning in fall 1939. These\nfour titles had blank endpapers. Since endpapers were printed from\nplates designed for the standard balloon cloth format, titles like\nEdmonds, *Rome Haul*, which were slightly larger than the standard\nballoon cloth format had endpapers with unprinted outer edges. An\nenlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The\ncentral panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the\nsurrounding pattern of open books and the initials “ml” was extended to\nfill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Four had\npictorial jackets; Steinbeck, *Of Mice and Men* and *The Wisdom of\nConfucius* had non-pictorial jackets. Two titles had predominately\nnon-pictorial jackets: the blue background of Canfield, *The Deepening\nStream*, was patterned to suggest water currents, and Proust, *Cities of\nthe Plain*, featured a small left-profile silhouette of the author. 95 cents. (Spring) Confucius, *Wisdom* xProust, *Cities of the Plain*; Giants\nthrough G40; jackets: 257. (Fall) Proust, *Cities of the Plain* xStone,\n*Lust for Life*; Giants through G42; jackets: 262. Cerf wanted to add a historical novel to the ML. He wrote Doubleday,\nDoran about Kenneth Roberts’s *Arundel*, which dealt with Benedict\nArnold’s expedition to Quebec during the Revolutionary War. He noted\nthat he understood that Roberts was not keen about having his books in\nreprint editions but argued that the ML should “be considered in a\nrather different category than the ordinary reprint. We have got one\nbook or more by almost every important American novelist in the series\nnow” (Cerf to Malcolm Johnson, Doubleday, Doran, 12 May 1938). Cerf then\nwrote to Roberts himself, offering an advance of $1,500 against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated, “In these days and times, a\n$1500.00 advance is a heavy one, but I feel so confident that ARUNDEL\nwould sell like blazes in the Modern Library series that I think the\nadvance would be earned in far less than the usual time and that,\ntherefore, the book would sell in the Modern Library series very\nsteadily for many years to come” (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 May 1938).\nDoubleday, Doran agreed to Cerf’s terms, but Roberts was unconvinced. He\nindicated that he was not certain that *Arundel* should be available in\na cheap edition, and subsequently wrote that he had decided “to wait a\nwhile longer before allowing a cheap edition of any of my books”\n(Roberts to Cerf, 21 November 1938).\n\nShortly thereafter Cerf wrote Hervey Allen about including his\nhistorical novel *Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants (Cerf to Hervey Allen, 6\nDecember 1938). He first expressed interest in *Anthony Adverse* five\nyears earlier, shortly after it was published (see 1933 Titles sought,\nsuggested, declined). *Anthony Adverse* sold 300,000 copies in its first\nsix months and led the fiction bestseller lists in 1933 and 1934.\nNothing came of Cerf’s initiative. Like Roberts’s *Arundel*, *Anthony\nAdverse* does not appear to have been published in an inexpensive\nreprint edition.\n\nCerf approached Little, Brown yet again about a ML edition of Charles\nNordhoff and James Norman Hall’s *Bounty* trilogy, but Alfred McIntyre\nof Little, Brown indicated that the books were still selling too well in\ntheir original editions to consider an inexpensive reprint (Cerf to\nMcIntyre, 19 April 1938; McIntyre to Cerf, 20 April 1938). That fall\nCerf wrote again:\n\n> What we want at the moment is a real leader or two for our Modern\n> Library list for the next year. We can get all the sound\n> run-of-the-mill titles, but it is a different problem to find another\n> item like our Freud or Jean Christophe to head next year’s list. This\n> brings me around once again to the question of the Bounty trilogy. If\n> we were to offer you $5000.00 cash on signing of the contract for an\n> edition of 50,000 copies of the trilogy, to be published in the Spring\n> of 1939 as a Modern Library Giant at $1.25, would you be inclined to\n> consider the proposal? The understanding would be that after 50,000\n> copies had been exhausted, we could not print another edition in this\n> format without a brand new contract with you. Frankly, I think this\n> would be a wonderful title for the Modern Library and that it would\n> establish the authors on a higher literary plane than they have ever\n> occupied before (Cerf to McIntyre, 7 September, 1938).\n\nThe advance was twice what Cerf had offered in 1936, though the royalty\nrate remained the same (see 1936 Titles sought, suggested, declined).\nMcIntyre replied that Little, Brown was publishing its own one-volume\nedition in October for the Christmas season and that it would be\nwithdrawn in January, after which Little, Brown would push the three\nseparate volumes (McIntyre to Cerf, 8 September 1938).\n\nIn 1940 Cerf tried again to secure the *Bounty* trilogy for the ML. On\nthat occasion he was told that Little, Brown was publishing a new\nedition of the trilogy with illustrations by N. C. Wyeth (Cerf to\nMcIntyre, 2 April 1940; McIntyre to Cerf, 6 April 1940). The edition\nwith Wyeth’s illustrations was published in October 1940.\n\nDuring a trip to England in fall 1938 Cerf met with George Bernard Shaw,\nwho had always opposed inexpensive reprint editions of his plays. On\nthis occasion Cerf reported in a letter to Random House, “Old boy spryer\nthan ever. All for us doing ‘9 Plays’ as Giant. Gotta get after Dodd,\nMead on this soon” (Cerf Papers Box 71, Cerf European trip (1) folder.\nCerf to Random House, undated). *Nine Plays* included *Mrs. Warren’s\nProfession*, *Arms and the Man*, *Candida*, *The Devil’s Disciple*,\n*Caesar and Cleopatra*, *Man and Superman*, *Fanny’s First Play*,\n*Androcles and the Lion*, and *Saint Joan*. However, when Cerf contacted\nDodd, Mead after his return, he indicated that the two firms would have\nto find a formula satisfactory to both, given the number of editions of\nShaw’s works that Dodd, Mead published. Since Dodd, Mead had no cheap\nedition of *St. Joan*, he suggested a ML edition of that play with “one\nor 2 lesser efforts. Perhaps Candida or Caesar & Cleopatra” (Cerf to\nHoward Lewis, Dodd, Mead & Co., 2 December 1938). There is no further\ncorrespondence in the archives about a ML reprint of Shaw’s plays. Shaw\nmay have changed his mind, or Dodd, Mead may have vetoed the idea. It\nwas only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to publish two\nvolumes of his plays: *Four Plays* (1953) and *Saint Joan, Major\nBarbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956).\n\nHenry Hoyns of Harper and Brothers suggested a ML edition of Paul\nHorgan’s novel *The Fault of Angels*, which had won the Harper Prize\nwhen it was published in 1933. Cerf replied that he did not think there\nwould be sufficient sales to justify a ML edition (Hoyns to Cerf, 4\nFebruary 1938; Cerf to Hoyns, 17 February 1938). Pearson, *Studies in Murder* (1938) 309\n\nEdmonds, *Rome Haul* (1938) 310\n\nSteinbeck, *Of Mice and Men* (1938) 311\n\nConfucius, *Wisdom of Confucius* (1938) 312\n\nGeorge, *Progress and Poverty* (1938) 313\n\nWebb, *Precious Bane* (1938) 314\n\nCanfield, *Deepening Stream* (1938) 315\n\nProust, *Cities of the Plain* (1938) 316 The spring 1938 RH catalogue was indicative of the growing importance of\nRH’s trade list. It included Isak Dineson’s *Out of Africa*, William\nFaulkner’s *Unvanquished*, Robert Graves’s *Count Belisarius*, Edgar\nSnow’s *Red Star Over China*, and John Strachey’s *What is to be Done?*\nOther titles included *The Public Papers* and *Addresses of Franklin D.\nRoosevelt* in five volumes and *The Complete Greek Drama*, a two-volume\nset in the Lifetime Library, a series of mainly ancient classics that\nbegan the previous year with *The Complete Dialogues of Plato*.

      "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1939",
      "year": "1939",
      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1939 1939 The ML underwent a major change in format and design for the second time\nin its history. The first, in 1929, substituted balloon cloth bindings\nfor imitation leather and introduced Rockwell Kent’s binding and\nendpaper designs. (Balloon cloth began to be used in January 1929;\nKent’s binding and endpaper designs were introduced in April.) The\nballoon cloth format suffered from two problems. The semi-flexible\nballoon cloth bindings were attractive but did not stand up to heavy\nuse. And the 6½ x 4¼ inch (165 x 107 mm) page size, retained from Boni &\nLiveright days, sometimes made it difficult to print from original\npublishers’ letterpress plates, most of which were designed for a larger\nformat. Many of the volumes printed from original publishers’ plates had\nuncomfortably narrow margins. Sometimes the original plates were too\nlarge to be used by the ML.\n\nThe ML’s economic model assumed multiple printings, and all ML books\nwere printed from plates. For older titles in the public domain the ML\nusually ordered new typesettings from which new plates were made.\nCopyrighted works were printed whenever possible from the original\npublisher’s plates. In general, the ML expected to pay royalties or\ntypesetting and plate-making costs but tried whenever possible to avoid\npaying both. Royalties paid by the ML to the original publisher were\nregarded in part as a plate rental. In this respect the ML operated no\ndifferently than Grosset & Dunlap and other publishers of hardbound\nreprints of current books. Grosset & Dunlap differed from the ML in that\nits printings were closer in size to the original publishers’ editions,\nand it rarely had problems using original publishers’ plates.\n\nThe ML had several options when the original publisher’s plates were too\nlarge for its format. The most expensive option was to reset the work to\nfit its format and make new letterpress plates. When the ML did this for\ncopyrighted titles the original publisher occasionally agreed to forego\nroyalties in whole or part until the plates were paid for. A second\noption was to photograph a clean copy of the original publisher’s\nedition, reduce the size of the type page photographically, and print by\noffset lithography. The disadvantage of this approach was that before\nthe 1960s offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress\nprinting and the quality was inferior. Another option when the original\npublisher’s plates were only slightly too large for the ML’s format was\nto print from a duplicate set of plates with the headline removed.\nFinally, the ML could print a given title in a slightly larger format in\norder to accommodate the original publisher’s plates. The ML resorted to\nthis option on several occasions during the balloon cloth era, and\nonce—for Charles Jackson’s *The* *Lost Weekend* (406), a short-lived\ntitle published in 1948—after the introduction of its larger format in\nfall 1939.\n\nAnother problem with the balloon cloth format was that it made it harder\nto sell ML books to libraries. Many libraries did not buy ML books\nbefore the 1940s because the bindings did not stand up to heavy use and\nthe narrow margins made rebinding difficult.\n\nA new format that corrected both faults was introduced in September 1939\nwith *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) and John Steinbeck, *In Dubious\nBattle* (322). The page size was increased half an inch to 7 x 4¾ inches\n(176 x 120 mm). And the balloon cloth binding was replaced with a far\nmore durable binding constructed of stiff boards covered with smooth\nlinen. The new binding, designed by Joseph Blumenthal, is described\nbelow. Two spring 1939 titles, Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317) and\nIsak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales* (320), were published in the larger\nformat with balloon cloth bindings.\n\nThe introduction of the larger format for regular ML volumes meant that\nexisting jackets had to be replaced or redesigned. A few titles received\nenlarged versions of their existing jackets, but most were outfitted in\nnewly designed jackets. Two designers were responsible for most of the\nnew jackets that were introduced at this period. Joseph Blumenthal\ncreated a large number of elegant typographic jackets. The majority of\nnew pictorial jackets were by Paul Galdone, a Hungarian-born illustrator\nof children’s books who designed his first ML jackets in 1937. Many ML\nGiants also received new jackets to go with their new bindings, although\nthe size of the Giants remained unchanged.\n\nThe introduction of the new format involved reprinting backlist titles\nat an accelerated pace so the series could regain a uniform appearance\nas quickly as possible. It also presented the ML with the problem of\ndisposing of balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse. When\nthe first two titles in new format were published in September 1939,\nover 200 regular ML titles remained in the balloon cloth format. It\nwould be February 1941 before the ML could announce, “Every title in the\nMODERN LIBRARY (95¢) is now ready *in the new binding!*” (*PW* 139, 15\nFebruary 1941, pp. 814–15).\n\nAn arrangement with the Book-of-the-Month Club, which appears to have\nbegun in fall 1938, may have been conceived in part as a way of reducing\nthe inventory of balloon cloth titles. The Book-of-the-Month Club\noffered free Modern Library books, all in balloon cloth bindings and\n1930s jackets, to members who made advance deposits of $12 or more\nagainst future purchases. Two 16-page brochures titled “Free Books” are\nknown to exist. The first is undated, gives the Book-of-the-Month Club’s\naddress as 386 Fourth Avenue, New York, and includes Fitzgerald’s *The\nGreat* *Gatsby*—now one of the most sought-after ML titles (*MLC* 46, p.\n1). The second catalog, dated 3-39 (March 1939), uses the Club’s new\naddress, 385 Madison Avenue. The March 1939 catalog can be viewed online\nat <http://www.modernlib.com/General/brochures/BOMC/BOMC39.html>\n(accessed 24 August 2017). It lists 103 titles from the regular ML and\n42 Giants—half of the titles then in the series—along with books from\nfive other reprint series. *The Great Gatsby*, which had been\ndiscontinued at the end of 1938, is not included in the second catalog,\nalthough a large number of unsold copies remained in the ML warehouse.\nAny hint that the offer was essentially a remaindering operation was\navoided. Book-of-the-Month Club members were also given the option of\nbuying ML books at the regular price. The arrangement with the\nBook-of-the-Month Club suggests that the ML planned the transition to\nthe new format well in advance.\n\nMost of the 110,000 balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse\nin early 1941 were disposed of at a widely publicized sale at Macy’s,\nthe New York department store. Macy’s was one of the leading retailers\nof ML books, and it made a cash offer for the remaining stock of balloon\ncloth bindings. The sale was announced in a full-page ad in the Sunday\n*New York Times* (2 February 1941, p. 27). The ad listed 166 titles that\nwere available in quantities of 100 copies or more. Another 50 balloon\ncloth titles were available in smaller quantities. The sale price for\nbooks in the discontinued binding was 33 cents. Three books were 94\ncents; the price for twenty was $5.98. The sale began Monday morning at\n9:30, and the books sold out in less than a week.\n\nOnce the transition to the new format was complete, the ML invited\nbooksellers to return their remaining stock of balloon cloth titles for\nreplacement with volumes in the new format. Booksellers had a one-month\nwindow during which balloon cloth volumes could be exchanged. By\nFebruary 1941, 700 accounts had returned around 160,000 books and\nreceived an equal number of volumes in the Blumenthal format at no cost.\nTwo months later Cerf indicated that returns of balloon cloth volumes\nwere expected to run to more than 200,000 copies. At that time the ML\nhad not decided what would be done with the returned books, but the U.S.\nGovernment was expected to buy thousands of them for libraries in\ncantonments where new troops were billeted (*PW* 139, 8 February 1941,\np. 741; 15 February 1941, pp. 814–15; 5 April 1941, p. 1459).\n\nThe year that saw the introduction of the ML’s new format was also the\nyear that the twentieth-century paperback revolution spread to the\nUnited States. The paperback revolution in the English-speaking world\nwas launched by Allan Lane, who founded Penguin Books in 1935. Pocket\nBooks, Inc., established in 1939, was the first American publisher of\nmass-market paperbacks. It operated very differently from the ML. The 6½\nx 4⅛ inch (164 x 105 mm) format of mass-market paperbacks was smaller\nthan the ML’s original format. Pocket Books ordered new typesettings for\nall of its titles, printed its books on high-speed magazine presses in\nprint runs vastly larger than the ML’s, and priced the books at 25\ncents. Magazine wholesalers, who distributed the books to mass-market\noutlets such as drug stores and newsstands, treated paperback books as\nthey did magazines. Newly published titles were distributed monthly.\nCredit for unsold copies of the previous month’s books was secured by\ntearing off the front covers and returning the covers. The coverless\nbooks were then pulped. Eight new titles were added to the Modern Library and nine were\ndiscontinued, reducing the number of titles in the regular series to\n218. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of\n1939 ML Giants included forty-six titles in forty-eight volumes.\n\n**Format and design**\n\nTwo spring titles (Liddell Hart, *The War in Outline* and Walton, *The\nCompleat Angler*) were published in the ML’s standard balloon cloth\nformat with binding D measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves\ntrimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). The other two spring titles\n(Stone, *Lust for Life* and Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*) were in a\nlarger format with balloon cloth bindings measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x\n123 mm).\n\nFall titles were published in a newly designed binding with stiff boards\nmeasuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ in.\n(177 x 120 mm). The larger format remained standard for nearly all\ntitles published in the regular ML from fall 1939 through 1968. In 1969\na taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding\nmeasuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182\nx 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles in the regular ML had the final version of Elmer Adler’s\ntitle page with the title in open-face type; three had torchbearer C2\nand five had torchbearer A2. All new titles had the 2-line imprint:\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nAdler’s title-page design was used for the last time in fall 1939.\nBeginning in 1940 Modern Library title pages were individually designed\nby Joseph Blumenthal. The balloon cloth binding was used for the last time in spring 1939. A\nnew binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the Spiral\nPress, was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. Blumenthal’s\nbinding was designed for the ML’s new 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format and used\nsmooth linen over stiff boards. The new bindings were in red, blue,\ngreen, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting\ncolor on the spine and front cover over upon which lettering stamped in\ngold. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the\npanels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were\nusually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Unlike\nballoon cloth bindings, where a portion of each printing of a given\ntitle was bound in cloth of different colors, each printing of a given\ntitle was typically bound in a single color combination. Successive\nprintings sometimes had bindings in different color combinations. As\nBlumenthal recalled it, Cerf and Klopfer accepted the design on the\nfirst sketch he submitted (Blumenthal to GBN, 30 June 1978).\n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold.\nKent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the inset\npanel on the spine. There were two versions of the inset panel on the\nfront cover, both of which employed a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel. The first version of the outer frame, used on the\ntwo titles published in September 1939 and all titles published\n1940–1962, featured Kent’s torchbearer in gold below the inset panel at\nthe lower right.\n\nBlumenthal appears to have been dissatisfied with the front panel\ndesign, and the two October 1939 titles, Fielding, *Joseph Andrews*\n(323) and Fineman, *Hear, Ye Sons* (324), feature an alternative\nversion. The panel with the title and author is unchanged, but Kent’s\ntorchbearer was omitted, and the outer frame in gold is adjusted so that\nthe top is the same distance (10 mm) from the inner panel as the sides,\nand the bottom is 12 mm from the inner panel. The omission of the\ntorchbearer gave the front panel of the binding a more classic,\nuncluttered appearance—but there was nothing on the front panel to\nidentify the series or associate the volume with the ML. All previous ML\nbindings had included a ML device on the front panel. It is not known\nwhether Blumenthal or Cerf and Klopfer made the decision to revert to\nBlumenthal’s original front panel design. All subsequent ML books except\nthe first three Giants and titles in the short-lived Illustrated Modern\nLibrary series have included a ML device on the front panel of the\nbinding. Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in moderate orange was used for one 1939 title,\nthe first printing of Walton, *Complete Angler* (319). The only other\n1939 title in the 6⅝ x 4⅜ inch format for which the endpaper had been\ndesigned was Liddell Hart, *War in Outline* (318), which used a map from\nthe original edition as the front and back endpaper. The other two\nspring 1939 titles, Stone, *Lust for Life* and Dinesen, *Seven Gothic\nTales*, were published in the larger 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would be\nadopted for all ML titles in fall 1939. The first printings of *Lust for\nLife* and *Seven Gothic Tales* had plain cream endpapers, as did the\nfour titles published in fall 1939. The only previous ML volume in the\n7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, John Reed’s *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935),\nalso had plain cream endpapers. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper\nwas introduced in spring 1940.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Four\ntitles (Stone, *Lust for Life*; Liddell Hart, *War in Outline*; Walton,\n*Compleat Angler*; and Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle*) had pictorial\njackets, and four (Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*; Odets, *Six Plays*;\nFielding, *Joseph Andrews*; and Fineman, *Hear, Ye Sons*) had\nnon-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Joseph Andrews* and *Hear, Ye\nSons* may have been designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed\nbinding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed\ntitle pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number\nof non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many\nolder titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the\nML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed. 95 cents. (Spring) Stone, *Lust for Life* xOdets, *Six Plays*; Giants through G45;\njackets: 265. (Fall) Odets, *Six Plays* xChaucer, *Troilus and\nCressida*; Giants through G48; jackets: 268. Cerf asked Knopf for permission to publish Thomas Mann’s *The Magic\nMountain* as a Giant, adding “we would be willing to make a special\nroyalty deal on this one book, and would pay a whopping advance for it\nimmediately” (Cerf to Knopf, 7 February 1939). Mann’s novel had appeared\nin the regular ML in 1932, but Knopf declined to renew the five-year\nreprint contract and the ML edition had been out of print since May\n1938. Knopf rejected Cerf’s offer. Several subsequent reprint offers by\nthe ML were also unsuccessful. *The Magic Mountain* was not restored to\nthe regular ML until 1992, after Random House’s “relaunch” of the\nseries. By this time Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., had been a division of\nRandom House for 32 years.\n\nCerf inquired about the possibility of doing a volume by Edna St.\nVincent Millay in the ML (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27\nFebruary 1939). Macmillan rejected an offer for the one-volume edition\nof Sir James George Frazier’s *The Golden Bough*, originally published\nin 1922, noting that it still netted the firm between $1,300 and $1,800\na year (George P. Brett, Macmillan, to Cerf, 7 August 1939). Cerf\nexpressed interest in reprinting John Galsworthy’s *The Forsyte Saga*\n(published in one volume by Scribner’s in 1925) as a Giant, offering an\nadvance of $7,500 (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939), but Scribner’s\nhad no interest in authorizing a reprint edition.\n\nCerf also expressed interest in including A. L. Morton, *A People’s\nHistory of England* in ML Giants (Cerf to Morton, 9 November 1939), but\nthe book never appeared in the series. The American edition had been\npublished by Random House the previous year. The original edition was\npublished in Britain by Victor Gollancz and had been the May 1938 main\nselection of Gollancz’s Left Book Club.\n\nClifford Odets suggested a collection of the best eight, ten, or twelve\nAmerican plays ever written (Odets to Cerf, 20 September 1939). Howard\nMumford Jones suggested a volume by Anthony Trollope (Jones to Cerf, 8\nJune 1938), but the ML had published *The Warden & Barchester Towers*\n(292) three years earlier. It would be eight years before Trollope’s\n*Eustace Diamonds* (399) was added. John Farrar suggested Henry Seidel\nCanby’s *Age of Confidence*, which Farrar & Rinehart had published five\nyears earlier.\n\nCerf considered adding Gustavus Myers’s *History of the Supreme Court of\nthe United States* but decided that it did not quite fit into the Modern\nLibrary list (Cerf to Kerr & Co., 7 November 1939).\n\nGertrude Stein urged Cerf to add her two autobiographical works, *The\nAutobiography of Alice B. Toklas* (Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1933) and\n*Everybody’s Autobiography* (Random House, 1937) to the ML (Stein to\nCerf, undated). Cerf replied that he would love to see them as a Giant\nbut that “public demand for these books is practically non-existent”\n(Cerf to Stein, 8 August 1939). Stein’s *Three Lives* (261) had been\npublished in the ML in 1933, but sales were disappointing and it was\ndiscontinued at the end of 1940. It would be twenty-four years before\nanother book by Stein appeared in the regular ML. *The Selected Writings\nof Gertrude Stein* (547) was published in 1963, followed by *The\nAutobiography of Alice B. Toklas* (623) in 1980. However, *The\nAutobiography of Alice B. Toklas* was reprinted in Random House’s\nquality paperback series, Modern Library Paperbacks, in fall 1955. After\nRandom House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, the Knopf series\nVintage Books became the quality paperback imprint for the combined\nfirm, and later paperback printings of *The Autobiography of Alice B.\nToklas* appeared in Vintage Books. Stone, *Lust for Life* (1939) 317\n\nLiddell Hart, *War in Outline* (1939) 318\n\nWalton, *Compleat Angler* (1939) 319\n\nDinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales* (1939) 320\n\nOdets, *Six Plays* (1939) 321\n\nSteinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* (1939) 322\n\nFielding, *Joseph Andrews* (1939) 323\n\nFineman, *Hear, Ye Sons* (1939) 324 The ML underwent a major change in format and design for the second time\nin its history. The first, in 1929, substituted balloon cloth bindings\nfor imitation leather and introduced Rockwell Kent’s binding and\nendpaper designs. (Balloon cloth began to be used in January 1929;\nKent’s binding and endpaper designs were introduced in April.) The\nballoon cloth format suffered from two problems. The semi-flexible\nballoon cloth bindings were attractive but did not stand up to heavy\nuse. And the 6½ x 4¼ inch (165 x 107 mm) page size, retained from Boni &\nLiveright days, sometimes made it difficult to print from original\npublishers’ letterpress plates, most of which were designed for a larger\nformat. Many of the volumes printed from original publishers’ plates had\nuncomfortably narrow margins. Sometimes the original plates were too\nlarge to be used by the ML. [object Object]"

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1940 1940 By 1940, Cerf and Klopfer had been in charge of the ML for nearly\nfifteen years. Many titles inherited from Boni & Liveright were\ndiscontinued in the 1930s; by 1940, less than a third of the Boni &\nLiveright titles remained. ML Giants joined the regular ML series in\n1931. By spring 1940, regular titles and Giants together numbered 270\ntitles—two-and-a-half times the size of the series when Cerf and Klopfer\nacquired it.\n\nThe increased representation of American authors in the ML that began in\nthe 1930s continued. By 1940, 28 percent of the authors in the regular\nseries were Americans, compared to 20 percent in 1930. Even so, British\nauthors remained in first place, accounting for 36 percent of the\nregular series. There was a marked falling off of French authors from 18\npercent in 1930 to 11 percent in 1940. This decline reflected the large\nnumber of French titles—most of which were inherited from Boni &\nLiveright days—that were dropped during the 1930s.\n\nBy 1940, the regular ML was a series of predominately modern works. In\n1940, 22 percent of the titles were works dating from the preceding 20\nyears. In spring 1940, works first published between 1881 and 1900 made\nup just 15 percent of the regular ML series, compared with 34 percent in\n1930 and 26 percent in 1925.\n\nThe tendency toward making the ML more middlebrow was reflected in an\nincreased proportion of fiction. By spring 1940, fiction accounted for\n64 percent of the regular ML. That was the highest proportion of fiction\nthe ML would ever contain. Eleven new titles were added to the ML and nine were discontinued,\nbringing the number of titles in the regular series to 219. Six new\ntitles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1940 ML Giants\nincluded fifty-two titles in fifty-four volumes. Beginning in 1940, ML title pages were individually designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. Existing titles\nacquired new title pages as they were reprinted. Blumenthal created the\nnew title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s new format (7¼ x 4⅞\ninches, enlarged from 6⅝ x 4⅜ inches) was introduced in fall 1939 and\nused through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards and\nwere sturdier than the ML’s earlier bindings. Books were bound in red,\nblue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a\ncontrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red\nbindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings\nwere usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those\nof gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was\ntypically bound in a single color combination.\n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold.\nKent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on\nthe spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside\nthe colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left)\nwas stamped in gold on all titles published 1940–1962. An enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the\nML’s larger format, was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels\nfeaturing Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged; the surrounding pattern of\nopen books and “ml” initials was extended to fill the larger space. The\nspring endpapers, like earlier Kent endpapers, were in moderate orange;\nfall 1940 endpapers were in gray. Kent endpapers in gray remained in use\nthrough spring 1966. New titles published in fall 1966 and spring 1967\nhad Kent endpapers in light yellowish brown. New endpapers designed by\nS. Neil Fujita were introduced in fall 1967 as part of a comprehensive\nredesign of the series.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Five\ntitles (Sheean, *Personal History*; Marquand, *The Late George Apley*;\nForester, *The African Queen*; Porter, *Flowering Judas and Other\nStories*; and Emerson, *The Complete Essays and Other Writings*) had\npictorial jackets. Six (Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida*; Machiavelli,\n*The Prince and The Discourses*; Lewisohn, *The Island Within*; Forster,\n*A Passage to India*; *The Short Bible*; and Morley, *Human Being*) had\nnon-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Troilus and Cressida*,\nMachiavelli, Lewisohn, and Forster were clearly designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and\nwhose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940.\nBlumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML\nduring the 1940s, including many for older titles that required new\njackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of\nBlumenthal’s jackets were signed. 95 cents. (Spring) Chaucer, *Troilus and Cressida* xEmerson, *Complete Essays*;\nGiants through G51; jackets: 271 (=spring 1941). (Fall) Emerson,\n*Complete Essays* xHugo, *Hunchback of Notre Dame*; Giants through G54;\njackets: 274. Cerf expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost (Cerf to\nHolt & Co., 12 February 1940), but it would be 1946 before *The Poems of\nRobert Frost* (393) appeared in the ML. Cerf tried again to get Rudyard\nKipling’s *Kim* for the ML, offering an advance of $2,000 against 10\ncents a copy royalties for reprint rights (Cerf to Van Cartmell,\nDoubleday, Doran, 27 February 1940). It would be another decade before\nthe ML secured reprint rights to Kipling’s novel. Cerf also sought\nMarjorie Kinnan Rawlings’s *The Yearling*, which was published by\nCharles Scribner’s Sons in 1938, became the year’s best-selling novel,\nand won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. He indicated that he wanted\nto publish it in 1942 (Cerf to Max Perkins, 11 April 1940). Scribner’s\ndid not grant reprint rights to the ML until 1946. The ML edition of\n*The Yearling* (391) appeared late in 1946.\n\nSeveral other titles to which Cerf tried to secure reprint rights never\nappeared in the series. He offered advances of $1,000 against royalties\nof 10 cents a copy for *The Collected Poems of T. S. Eliot* and Lytton\nStrachey’s *Queen Victoria* (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 26 April 1940;\nCerf to Donald Brace, 3 May 1940). He had been trying to get *Queen\nVictoria* for the ML since 1928. He also wanted to publish William\nGraham Sumner’s *Folkways* as an ML Giant. He offered Ginn & Co., who\nfirst published it in 1906, a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. “Judging by our sales of similar volumes of the series,”\nhe wrote, “I think it fair to assume that we will sell these 10,000\ncopies within a year and a half, and that thereafter the book should\nsell between 2000 and 4000 copies every year. . . .” (Cerf to Richard\nThornton, Ginn & Co., 16 August 1940). Thornton declined the offer: “We\nstill have a fair sale for the book, and we have recently put out a\nspecial Centennial Edition \\[Sumner was born in 1840\\], which we have\nbeen giving extra promotion” (Thornton to Cerf, 25 September 1940).\n\nCerf received a suggestion for Alfred Thayer Mahan’s *Influence of Sea\nPower upon History*, but after seeing a copy he concluded it was “too\nspecial in its appeal—and dated, too—to be a likely candidate for ML”\n(Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 April 1940).

The next four years would be difficult, as publishers\nstruggled with a huge increase in demand for books coupled with scarcity\nof resources, including paper rationing, the absence of personnel who\nserved in the armed services, and other dislocations caused by the war.\nThe end of the war in August 1945 was accompanied by rapid inflation and\na wave of strikes that disrupted the return to a peacetime economy. It\nwould be September 1948 before the Modern Library could announce, “Every\ntitle in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now back in\nstock for the first time since the war” (Modern Library advertisement,\n*Publishers’ Weekly*, September 17, 1948, p. 1095). Ten titles were added to the ML and ten were discontinued. The number of\ntitles in the series remained at 219, the same as in 1940. Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by\nJoseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He\ncreated the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and\nmaking electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used\nsmooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or\ngray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the\nspine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black\nor dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of\ngreen bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were\nusually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a\nsingle color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover\nwere framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was\nstamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front\ncover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within\nwhich Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. The enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the\nML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through\nspring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers\nfeatured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by a pattern of open books and\n“ml” initials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through\nspring 1966.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTwo 1941 titles (Saroyan, *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* and\nBemelmans, *My War with the United States*) were originally published by\nRandom House; their ML jackets were adapted from the RH jackets. The\nSaroyan jacket was designed by Ernest Reichl, and the jacket for *My War\nwith the United States* featured an adaptation of one of Bemelmans’s\nillustrations.\n\nThe jacket for Steinbeck, *The Grapes of Wrath* incorporated a\nreproduction of Thomas Hart Benton’s lithograph “Departure of the Joads”\nfrom his Grapes of Wrath series. Paul Galdone was responsible for three\njackets: Hugo, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was an individually\ndesigned pictorial jacket; *Five Great Modern Irish Plays* and Lardner,\n*Collected Stories* featured a decorative non-pictorial design that was\nused on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s.\n\nPascal, *Pensées & The Provincial Letters*, had a typographic jacket\nthat was clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal. Three other\npredominately typographic jackets were probably also by Blumenthal, who\nsigned none of his jackets. *The Federalist* featured a decorative image\nof an American eagle, Proust’s *The Captive* had a small silhouette of\nProust in left profile that was also used on the other six titles of\n*Remembrance of Things Past*, and Plato’s *Republic* had an inset\nphotographic image of a bust of Plato. 95 cents.

Cerf expressed interest in Ernest Hemingway’s *For Whom the Bell Tolls*,\npublished by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1940: “This is one book above\nalmost any other that has been written in the past five years that I’d\nlike to see on the Modern Library list when the time comes” (Cerf to Max\nPerkins, 23 July 1941). The ML never secured reprint rights. In 1953\nScribner’s served notice that it was withdrawing all three Hemingway\ntitles in the ML—*The Sun Also Rises* (190), *A Farewell to Arms* (237),\nand *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* (G59)—in order to publish\ntheir own reprint editions in all English-speaking markets in North\nAmerica.\n\nConrad Aiken repeated his suggestion for a ML edition of his first\nnovel, *Blue Voyage*, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1927\n(Aiken to Cerf, 19 May 1941).

He was\ncommissioned as a captain in May 1942 and left for training in\nCalifornia at the end of month. He was away from Random House until\nafter the war. The war years were good ones for him. He was posted to\nEngland with the Eighth Air Force in October 1943 and served as an\nintelligence officer for a heavy bomber squadron—the job he wanted. When\nhe stopped by Random House to say his final goodbyes before leaving for\nLondon, Cerf thought he looked “happier and more excited than I have\never seen him in my life before” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19\nOctober 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\nEarly the following year he was promoted to major (Cerf, “Trade Winds,”\n*Saturday Review of Literature*, 12 February 1944, p. 19).\n\nCerf was four years older than Klopfer and too old for military service.\nHe remained a civilian, looking after Random House and playing an active\nrole in the Council on Books in Wartime, of which he was a director. “I\nget damned impatient plugging away at publishing,” he told a friend in\nthe service in 1943, “while all of you fellows are out there doing\nthings I’d like to be doing myself, but I may as well face the fact that\nI am 45, that I am nearsighted as a bat, and that somebody has to keep\nRandom House rolling along” (Cerf to Smart, 26 August 1943, Random House\nCollection).\n\nRandom House rolled through the war years with increasing momentum. The\nfirm was fortunate in that Klopfer was the only senior member who left\nto enter the service. Commins, several years older than Cerf, remained\nat Random House throughout the war, as did Haas, who was in his early\nfifties. It was Haas, however, who was touched most deeply by the war.\nHis son, a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy, was killed in action in\n1943.\n\nRandom House had grown slowly in the 1930s. Each year sales increased\nover the previous year, but the increases were often small. The firm’s\nsales did not reach a million dollars until 1941. Beginning with sales\nof $256,000 in 1926, it took Cerf and Klopfer fifteen years to reach the\nmillion-dollar figure. Thereafter, sales increased rapidly. Cerf wrote\nin 1943, “I think we have reached the major leagues as publishers now,\nand I damn well mean for us to stay there” (Cerf to Smart, 26 August\n1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\n\nPart of Random House’s wartime growth could be attributed to a series of\nbest-selling war books. The firm’s first big seller in this category was\nCecil Brown’s *Suez to Singapore*, about the sinking of the British\nbattleship *Prince of Wales* and the battle cruiser *Repulse* several\ndays after Pearl Harbor. It appeared in August 1942. Shortly thereafter\ncame Richard Tregaskis’s *Guadalcanal Diary*, published in January 1943.\nIt was the first Random House book to sell over 100,000 copies (Cerf,\n*At Random*, p. 163). Random House’s next big war book was *Thirty\nSeconds over Tokyo* by Ted W. Lawson.\n\nDuring the war Cerf began to be well-known to the public at large as a\nwriter and speaker. He took over the “Trade Winds” column in *Saturday\nReview of Literature* in February 1942. For the next fifteen years he\nenlivened the magazine’s pages with a weekly mixture of publishing\ngossip, jokes, and stories. He also began to compile what became a long\nseries of best-selling humor books. The first, *The Pocket Book of War\nHumor*, was an original paperback published by Pocket Books early in\n1943. It was a collection, edited by Cerf, of previously published\nmaterial. His objective in compiling it was to do something to dispel\nthe widespread despondency that followed the American loss of the\nPhilippines and Bataan (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 174). The book sold over a\nmillion copies.\n\nCerf’s next project was a collection of humorous anecdotes and stories,\n*Try and Stop Me*, published by Simon and Schuster in 1944. It became a\nbestseller and was widely distributed in an Armed Services Edition to\nmembers of the armed services around the world. “It was just the kind of\nbook they needed and appreciated—it made them laugh,” Cerf later\nrecalled (*At Random*, p. 181). He subsequently wrote many other humor\nbooks, but he always regarded *Try and Stop Me* as his best (*At\nRandom*, p. 180). The book led to a newspaper column syndicated to\nseveral hundred newspapers by King Features. Also called “Try and Stop\nMe,” it started as a serialization of the book, but when that material\nwas used up, Cerf supplied new stories and jokes to keep the column\ngoing. But Cerf never overestimated his own publications. In a 1945\nletter to Gertrude Stein, whom he had not seen since before the war, he\nwrote:\n\n> You write asking whether I have changed any since you saw me last. I\n> honestly don’t think I have. I am a bit grayer, of course, and don’t\n> get around a tennis court quite as fast as I used to, but I like to\n> think that my whole attitude to life hasn’t changed a bit. Certainly I\n> am getting more fun out of it today than I ever did before. Besides\n> the publishing, which has gone beautifully, I have been writing trivia\n> for magazines and in book form and, while I know it is utterly\n> unimportant drivel, people seem to like it and want more of it (Cerf\n> to Gertrude Stein, 17 March 1945, Random House Collection, Columbia\n> University Library).\n\nWhen a reader wrote Cerf in 1954 suggesting that his humor books be\nbrought together and published as a ML Giant, he responded that he was\nflattered. “But quite honestly,” he added, “I’m not good enough” (Cerf\nto Ralph Winans, 22 July 1954, Random House Collection).\n\nCerf was as engaging a speaker as he was a writer. His first major\nexposure came with tours of well-known writers selling war bonds for the\nTreasury Department. This was followed by a weekly radio program for the\nCouncil of Books in Wartime called “Books Are Bullets” in which he\ninterviewed authors of war books. The radio program led to lecture tours\nthrough the Colston Leigh Agency. By the early 1950s, through extensive\nlecturing and, even more so, as a result of his participation as a\nregular panelist on the Sunday evening television program “What’s My\nLine,” Cerf had become a celebrity. He enjoyed being a celebrity, and\nthe publicity he attracted brought enhanced recognition of Random House\namong the public at large.\n\n**War Production Board**\n\nThe War Production Board was established in January 1942, a few weeks\nafter the United States entered the war. Its purpose was to direct war\nproduction and assign priorities to the delivery of scarce materials.\nPaper use in the publishing industry was limited in the fall of 1942,\nwhen each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota based on its use\nof paper in 1941. Initially publishers were restricted to 90 per cent of\nthe amount of paper they used before the war. This was not a severe\nhardship, especially compared with Britain, where publishers in 1942\nwere having to get by with 37½ per cent of the paper they used in 1939\n(Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 29 August 1942,\np. 20). But the restrictions became increasingly severe as the war went\non. There was an additional 10 per cent cut in 1943, and a further 15\nper cent cut the following year (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 26 August\n1943; Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944, Random House Collection,\nColumbia University Library).\\]\\\\ Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by\nJoseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He\ncreated the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and\nmaking electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used\nsmooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or\ngray cloth with lettering in gold on inset rectangular panels in a\ncontrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red\nbindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings\nwere usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those\nof gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was\ntypically bound in a single color combination. The inset panels on the\nspine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer\n(facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The\npanel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored\ninner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped\nin gold. The enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the\nML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through\nspring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers\nfeatured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by pattern of open books and “ml”\ninitials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through\nspring 1966.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll 1942 jackets were individually designed except *Collected Stories of\nDorothy Parker* (353)*,* which used a decorative non-pictorial jacket\ndesigned by Paul Galdone that was used on six ML titles between fall\n1939 and the early 1940s. Galdone was also responsible for three other\njackets: Ward, *Oracles of Nostradamus* (346); Lewis, *Babbitt* (348);\nand Hellman, *Four Plays* (351). Joseph Blumenthal designed three\ntypographic jackets: Tacitus, *Complete Works* (350); Milton, *Complete\nPoetry and Selected Prose* (354); and Santayana, *Philosophy* (355). E.\nMcKnight Kauffer was responsible for three pictorial jackets: Wright,\n*Native Son* (349); Maurois, *Disraeli* (352); and Bellamy, *Looking\nBackward* (357). The designers of two pictorial jackets, Crane, *Red\nBadge of Courage* (347) and Byrne, *Messer Marco Polo* (356), have not\nbeen identified. 95 cents. (Spring) Lewis, *Babbitt* xMaurois, *Disraeli*; Giants through G58 with\nG21 *Sixteen Famous American Plays*; jackets: 281. (Fall) Maurois,\n*Disraeli* xDu Maurier, *Rebecca*; Giants through G60; jackets: 284.\n\n*Note:* New titles for fall 1942 have spring 1942 lists of ML titles\ninside the jackets. This oversight probably reflects the absence of\nKlopfer, who had been responsible for the printing and production of ML\nbooks before his departure in May to serve in the Air Force. Lists of ML\ntitles at the end of the volumes were not affected. Both of the fall\n1942 titles that include lists—Parker, *Collected Stories* (353) and\nMilton, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (354a)—have fall 1942 lists\nat the end of the volume Ward, *Oracles of Nostradamus* (1942) 346\n\nCrane, *Red Badge of Courage* (1942) 347\n\nLewis, *Babbitt* (1942) 348\n\nWright, *Native Son* (1942) 349\n\nTacitus, *Complete Works* (1942) 350\n\nHellman, *Four Plays* (1942–1960); *Six Plays* (1960) 351\n\nMaurois, *Disraeli* (1942) 352\n\nParker, *Collected Stories* (1942) 353\n\nMilton, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (1942) 354\n\nSantayana, *Philosophy of Santayana* (1942) 355\n\nByrne, *Messer Marco Polo* (1942) 356\n\nBellamy, *Looking Backward* (1942) 357\n\nPaul, *Life and Death of a Spanish Town* (1942) 358 The war brought many changes to Random House. Klopfer, who was\nthirty-nine, applied for a commission in the Air Force. He was\ncommissioned as a captain in May 1942 and left for training in\nCalifornia at the end of month. He was away from Random House until\nafter the war. The war years were good ones for him. He was posted to\nEngland with the Eighth Air Force in October 1943 and served as an\nintelligence officer for a heavy bomber squadron—the job he wanted. When\nhe stopped by Random House to say his final goodbyes before leaving for\nLondon, Cerf thought he looked “happier and more excited than I have\never seen him in my life before” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19\nOctober 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\nEarly the following year he was promoted to major (Cerf, “Trade Winds,”\n*Saturday Review of Literature*, 12 February 1944, p. 19).

Between 1942\nand 1943, sales of ML books increased from $339,902 to $596,454.\n\nThe war brought not only increased demand for books in general but also\nshifts in demand for certain types of books. Books dealing with the war\nitself were popular. But there also seems to have been increased demand\nfor books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry\nand philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a\ndisproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong\namong men in the service.\n\nThe Modern Library’s most notable new venture in the 1940s was a series\ncalled the Illustrated Modern Library. It was launched in 1943 in the\nmidst of the war. Each volume contained specially commissioned\nillustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell,\nSalvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz\nKredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes\nwere one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in\nindividually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943\nin time for the Christmas season. Fourteen additional titles were issued\nbetween 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library\ninitially sold for $1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war\nforced the discontinuation of the series. Seven titles were added to the series and three were discontinued,\nbringing the total number of titles in the list to 231. Titles published in 1943 were 7¼ x 4⅞ inch page size with individually\ndesigned title pages. Many of the title pages were designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, who set them at his Spiral Press and made electrotype plates\nfor the use of the Modern Library’s regular printers. The binding, also\ndesigned by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth\nlinen. Blumenthal’s binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or\ndark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped\nin gold. Kent’s torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on\nthe spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were\nbordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside\neach panel.\n\nThe bindings were red, blue, green, or gray. Unlike the balloon cloth\nbindings used from 1929 through spring 1939, each printing of a given\ntitle was available in only one color.\n\nRockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a\ncentral panel of 1¾ by 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer,\nsurrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the\ntorchbearers; for the rest of the endpapers, there were torchbearers on\nthe paste-down and free endpapers facing each other, light brownish gray\n(63); endpapers in medium orange (53). 95 cents McKeon had an idea for a collection entitled *Medieval Philosophers*.\nCerf asked Hoyns for reprint rights to Fosdick’s *On Being a Real\nPerson*, saying it was “one of the finest books that has been published\nin the past ten years,” and offering a $5,000 advance (Cerf to Hoyns, 12\nNovember 1943).\n\nHoyns suggested Silone’s *The Seed Beneath the Snow* and Algren’s *Never\nCome Morning* for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 20 May 1943).\n\nCerf declined to add an Elizabeth Bowen novel, noting “I don’t think\nthat there will be a sufficient demand for any of Elizabeth Bowen’s\nnovels to justify such an addition to the Modern Library series” (Cerf\nto Brown, 20 July 1943).

Barnes & Co., Inc.*\n\n*Distributed by Random House, Inc.*\n\nPaper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in\ndemand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable\nto satisfy the demand for books.\n\nThe War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry\nin fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota\nbased on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to\n90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions\nbecame increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional\n10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year.\n\nMost publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a\nfew—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In\nfall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the\ntextbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated\nModern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board\nrequirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series\nwhile RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles,\nincluding those noted above, were also published under this arrangement.\nThe ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several\nother publishers that had surplus paper.\n\nThe War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in\nMarch 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers\nwere able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from\ncollege text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for\nthe duration \\[of the war\\]. We counted on doing the same this year.\nWhen the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire\nproduction schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis\nBrowne, 4 April 1944).\n\nAll subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by\nRandom House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML\nstopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued\nto appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to\ngo out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The\nprofit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants\nwere paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML\nbooks, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length.\n\nA. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the\nIllustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was\nlimited. Random House continued to select titles for the series,\ncommission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate\nmaking, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were\nreprinted. Nine titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now\ncontained 239 titles. The 1943 format was unchanged for the 1944 publications. All new titles\nin the regular ML were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x\n118 mm).

The price\nincrease was the first for the regular ML since May 1920. The first new\ntitle published at $1.10 was Rawlings, *The Yearling* (391), but the\n$1.10 price was short lived. The retail price increased to $1.25 on 15\nApril 1947. The ML printed the list price at the top of the jacket flap,\nand first printings of titles published at 95 cents and $1.10 are\ncommonly found in price-clipped jackets.

(Fall) Balzac, *Père Goriot\n& Eugénie Grandet* xAristotle, *Introduction*; Giants through G70;\njackets: 316. William Rose, Jr., the president of Harper &Brothers, cancelled a\nproposed ML reprint of James Henry Breasted’s *The Conquest of\nCivilization* (1926; rev. ed., 1938), noting that the book was basically\na trade edition of Breasted’s textbook *Ancient Times* (Ginn & Co.,\n1916; 2nd ed., 1935). Ginn was concerned that a 95-cent ML edition would\nhurt sales of *Ancient Times* in college towns (Rose to Cerf, 5 July\n1946). Klopfer rejected a suggestion to include H. G. Wells’s *History\nof Mr. Polly* in the ML (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 9 September 1946). The\nML also decided against Sigmund Freud’s *Leonardo da Vinci* (Dodd, Mead,\n1932), which was not included in *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud*\n(Giant, 1938). A. A. Brill, who had translated *Leonardo da Vinci* and\nedited the Giant, sent a copy to Commins for consideration, indicating\nthat Dodd, Mead was willing to return all rights to the book (A. A.\nBrill to Commins, 4 October 1946). The length of *Leonardo da\nVinci*—just 130 pages—was a problem. It never appeared in the ML, but\nfifteen years later it was published in Vintage Books, Random House’s\nquality paperback series.

Saxe Commins, one of the\ngreat editors of his era, remained editor in chief of the Modern\nLibrary. Although officially in charge of the series at this period,\njudging from evidence in the Random House archives, his involvement was\nsmall.\n\nSales at Random House continued to grow. With Giants back in-stock after\nthe paper rationing of the war years, sales increased from their low in\n1945 of $92,085 to $544,632 in 1947. Sales of titles in the regular ML\nalso continued to increase; $834,907 in 1946 to $946,415 in 1947. Ten titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now\ncontained 260 titles. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a\ncontrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Two shades of gray\n(265 med.; 266 dk.) were used for the binding. The inset panels on the\nspine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer\n(facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The\npanel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored\ninner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped\nin gold. $1.10 (January–14 April); $1.25 (15 April–December). Three of the spring\ntitles (*Introduction to Aristotle*, *The Best Short Stories of Bret\nHarte*, and *The Eustace Diamonds*) were published at $1.10. *The Best\nof S. J. Perelman* (395) and Caldwell, *Tobacco Road* (397) did not\nappear until May and were published with $1.25 price stickers on the\njacket flaps. All fall titles were published at $1.25.\n\nThe $1.10 retail price introduced in November 1946 lasted for less than\nsix months. Costs continued to rise, and Klopfer advised Cerf in\nFebruary that another price increase was likely. Cerf, who was\nvacationing in Beverly Hills, replied: “If we <u>must</u> boost ML to\n$1.25, let’s get it over with, & for God’s sake alter jacket copy so\nthat price appears <u>only</u> on detachable flap. Some stores out here\nare selling ML <u>without</u> jackets to avoid squabbles on price. This\nain’t good!” (Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947; Cerf to Klopfer, 23\nFebruary 1947, underlining in original).\n\nBeginning in fall 1947 the retail price was printed on the top corner of\nthe jacket flap where it could be clipped off easily, and the price was\nomitted from the back panel of the jacket. Since most of the jackets in\nstores still bore the printed price of $1.10 or even 95 cents,\nbooksellers were supplied with gummed price-change stickers to be\naffixed to the flaps. These read: “As of April 15, 1947, the price of\nThe Modern Library in U.S.A. is $1.25 a copy. Other markings void. The\nModern Library, Inc.” Cerf continued to make offers for James Stephens, *The* *Crock of Gold*,\nbut was informed that Macmillan still planned to reissue it (James\nPutnam to Cerf, 8 May 1947). The Macmillan reprint appeared later that\nyear. He also wanted Lytton Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex* for the ML,\nbut the Harcourt, Brace edition was selling too well as a textbook. S.\nSpenser Scott of Harcourt, Brace wrote Cerf, “I am sure that you will\nagree that the Modern Library books do compete with the textbook\neditions—and well they should, because you have done a grand job on\ngetting them into college stores” (Scott to Cerf, 24 September 1947).\n\nCerf declined Wendell Wilkie’s *One World* when Manuel Siwek of Grosset\n& Dunlap suggested it for the ML (Cerf to Siwek, 10 June 1947). He also\nrejected Wallace Stegner’s novel *Big Rock Candy Mountain*, indicating\nthat the plates were too large for the regular series and that it\nwouldn’t have sufficient sales for Modern Library Giants (Cerf to\nCharles Duell, 2 October 1947).

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1949 1949 The postwar history of the Modern Library can be regarded as dating from\nthe beginning of 1949. That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two\nmajor developments: the continuing expansion and consolidation of the\npaperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that\nincreased the importance of the college market.\n\nCerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning. He\ntried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in\npaperback Pocket Book editions. When the ML had exclusive reprint rights\nto copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing\nthem. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books\nto publish two titles that deGraff wanted: Vincent Sheean’s *Personal\nHistory*, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving\nStone’s *Lust for Life*, which had been in the ML for less than a year.\n\nOften the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works.\nThe terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances\nin which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset & Dunlap\nor other hardbound reprint edition. Even if the ML had exclusive reprint\nrights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year\nintervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release\npaperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from\nthe ML when the contract expired.\n\nBefore the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback\neditions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier\nby the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously\naffect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality\npaperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library\nPaperbacks.\n\nRandom House responded to growth in the college market for quality books\nearlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950\nunder the direction of Jess Stein. Eleven new titles were added to the ML and five were discontinued,\nbringing the total number of titles in the regular series to 271. Modern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark\nblue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a\ngiven title was typically bound in a single-color combination. The inset\npanels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer Kent’s torchbearer\n(facing left) was stamped in gold. $1.25.

Morton Dauwen Zabel, professor of English at the University of Chicago,\nsuggested a ML edition of Joseph Conrad’s *Under Western Eyes*. He\nwrote, “I can think of no novel of Conrad’s outside of Lord Jim,\nVictory, and Heart of Darkness (all of them already included in the\nModern Library) which more deserves to be known. The general neglect of\nit, hitherto, is a shame” (Zabel to Jess Stein, 31 October 1949). Stein\nforwarded the suggestion to Cerf, but the general consensus was that\nthere was insufficient demand to justify a ML edition.

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1950 1950 In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library\nCollege Editions. All of the early titles were taken from the regular\nModern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold\ninitially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular\nModern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they\nwere issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward\nthe academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a\ndistinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new\nseries had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath\nBrooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson,\nRoyal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray,\nMark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and\nMorton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in\nregular Modern Library printings as well.\n\nMany of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken\nover the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often\nthan not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met.\nIn contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College\nEditions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They\nwere, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was\nbeginning to eat into the Modern Library’s college market with their\nregular Modern Library series.\n\nThat series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart & Co. in late\n1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics\naimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to\nseventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound\nvolumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were\nwell-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics.\n\nThe Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess\nStein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions\nfrom the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore\norders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and\nIllinois.\n\nThe Random House juvenile department, already well established with such\nauthors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to\nthe firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched\nin 1950. Nine new titles were added and four discontinued in the regular ML\nseries, bringing the total titles to 276. There were an additional 74\ntitles in the Giants. The Modern Library College Editions launched with\n41 titles of non-royalty-bearing works. Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards.

Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was\nstamped in gold. $1.25. (Spring) James, *Washington Square* xAlcott, *Little Women*; Giants\nthrough G74; jackets: 347. (Fall) Alcott, *Little Women* xCicero, *Basic\nWorks*; Giants through G75 with G57 Brooks, *Flowering of New England*;\njackets: 348. Gordon S. Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot’s\n*Middlemarch* for ML College Editions and offered to write an\nintroduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six\nmonths later: “You will find all the contemporary English critics like\nLeavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf’s\nopinion about *Middlemarch* as the great novel of the 19th Century. It\nis back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will\nbe a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and\nWorld’s Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by\nthe time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who\nhave anticipated the change in critical estimate” (Haight to Stein, 15\nJune 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML’s new paperback series, Modern\nLibrary College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published\nat the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, “There are some\ntitles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far\nare assured top sellers, while *Middlemarch*, although rated high\ncritically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as,\nsay, *Anna Karenina*. . . . The status of *Middlemarch* on our list here\nis simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at\nleast break even on *Middlemarch* we will include it” (Stein to Haight,\n20 June 1950). *Middlemarch* (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984.\n\nJess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph\nConrad’s *Nostromo* and *The Nigger of the Narcissus*, Theodore\nDreiser’s *An American Tragedy*, George Eliot’s *Adam Bede*, Oliver\nGoldsmith’s *Vicar of Wakefield*, three works by Henry James (*Daisy\nMiller*, *The American*, and *The Golden Bowl*), Franz Kafka’s *The\nCastle*, Jack London’s *Call of the Wild*, Lucretius’s *On the Nature of\nThings*, Frank Norris’s *The Pit*, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s *Quo Vadis*,\nIgnazio Silone’s *Bread and Wine*, Edmund Spenser’s *Faerie Queen*,\nHenri Stendhal’s *Charterhouse of Parma*, Mark Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn*, Edith Wharton’s *Ethan Frome*, Owen Wister’s *The\nVirginian*, and Emile Zola’s *Germinal* (Stein to Cerf, 10 October\n1950). The following titles on Stein’s list were published in the\nregular series or ML Giants: Conrad, *Nostromo* (1951: 438); Dreiser,\n*An American Tragedy* (1950: G89); Goldsmith, *Vicar of Wakefield and\nOther Writings* (1955: 476); Kafka, *The Castle* (1969: 610); and\nSpenser, *Selected Poetry* (1964: G104). Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn* was available as part of a ML Giant that included\n*Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as\na volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein’s list were former\nML titles that had been discontinued: James, *Daisy Miller; An\nInternational Episode* (1918: 60) and Stendhal, *Charterhouse of Parma*\n(1937: 298).\n\nSomerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James’s *[Principles\nof\nPsychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology)y*\n(Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume\nof Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to\nStein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been\nenthusiastic about the proposal.

The series maintained close ties with the regular Modern\nLibrary series during this time. Most titles continued to be selected\nfrom the regular Modern Library series and adapted with new\nintroductions for the college market. However, anthologies of works by\nBrowning, Byron, Keats, and Shelley were compiled especially for Modern\nLibrary College Editions. The Keats and Shelley anthologies were also\npublished in the regular Modern Library in spring 1951; the Browning and\nByron volumes were added to the regular series in 1954.\n\nTen additional titles were added to the College Editions in January,\n1951. In contrast to the initial group of forty-one non-royalty bearing\ntitles, several of those added in 1951 required royalty payments.\nDespite these additions, the Modern Library College Editions began to\nencounter difficulties in its second year. Production costs were going\nup and college enrollments temporarily declined as the pool of former\nsoldiers attending college on the G.I bill exhausted. The series did not\nfully recover until 1956. Thereafter, sales continued to be strong. The\nseries maintained its position in the 1960s when the regular Modern\nLibrary began to falter and continued throughout the 1970s after the\nregular series became moribund. Twelve new titles were added to the series and two titles were\nsuperseded by more current editions. This brought the total titles\navailable to 288. All new titles were published in the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff\nlinen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal, Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in\ngray, and the top edge stained to match the inset panels on the spine\nand front cover. Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. # The books were printed by Parkway Printing Co. and bound by H. Wolff Book Manufacturing Co.\n\nThe binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark\nblue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a\ngiven title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset\npanels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was\nstamped in gold. $1.25.

Priestley’s *The Good\nCompanions* (Klopfer to William Rose, 12 February 1951) and *Mark\nTwain’s America* by Bernard DeVoto.

Jess Stein, who came to Random House after the\nwar to work on *The American College Dictionary* and stayed to work with\nreference books and college texts, was the first to alert Random House\nof the implications of this development. He alerted Lewis Miller in the\nfollowing memo:\n\n> I now have a little more information about the Doubleday paperbacks\n> which were the subject of the rumor I heard yesterday. This new series\n> apparently will appear in April with 12 titles and prices will range\n> from 65¢ to 95¢.

The Scribner’s withdrawal was especially\ndifficult for the Modern Library, since the titles were the best-known\nworks of Ernest Hemingway. The firm had decided to promote its backlist\nmore vigorously. When plans were made to issue Hemingway’s works in a\nuniform edition, Scribner’s decided to terminate the Modern Library’s\nreprint contracts.\n\nCerf was dismayed at the news. Losing Hemingway from the Modern Library\nwas an unwelcome prospect. As Klopfer stated later, “The Modern Library\nhas enormous prestige as a series of literary books and there are very\nfew living American authors who deserve to be included in it, and\ncertainly Ernest Hemingway belongs there” (Klopfer to Darrow, 13 July\n1954). Eight titles were added and six were discontinued, bringing titles in\nthe list to 290. New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the\nstiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s\nendpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth\nwith inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue,\nred or green) on the spine and front cover.

He wanted to publish a ML edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s\n*Tender is the Night* (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, 10 April 1952). He also\nwanted to include a book by John Galsworthy in the series but was not\ninterested in any of the titles that Scribner’s were willing to\nconsider.

He also expressed interest in a volume of Frank\nO’Connor short stories (Cerf to O’Connor, 25 May 1953). Joseph Prescott\nsuggested Faulkner’s *Intruder in the Dust* for the ML (Prescott to ML,\n20 February 1953). Gordon S.

Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had\nbeen criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux’s\n1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes’s *Don\nQuixote*; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *Iliad* and *Odyssey*;\nConstance Garnett’s translation of Chekhov’s *Plays*; and anonymous\ntranslations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had\nsuperior translations of these and other works.\n\nIn March 1954, Klopfer received a letter from Milton Waldman of the\nBritish publishing firm Rupert Hart-Davis, who wrote that Lane had\nexpressed an interest in arranging for joint publication of various\nclassics with the Modern Library (Milton Waldman to Klopfer, 31 March\n1954). Jess Stein was given the job of examining the translations in\nPenguin Classics. He prepared a long memorandum for Klopfer in which he\nindicated which Penguin translations would be desirable for the Modern\nLibrary. However, nothing came of the negotiations with Lane and in\n1955, Random House launched the Modern Library Paperbacks. Eight titles were added and five were discontinued.

William Collins\nand Sons contacted the ML about sharing the cost of translating the\ngreat Russian novelists for the ML and their Pocket Classics (William\nCollins to Klopfer, 9 July 1954), but nothing appears to have come of\nthis. E. B. White wrote of a ML offer, “About the Bennett Cerf inquiry,\nI have no interest at the moment in collecting my ‘early work.’ Most of\nit is in collected form already, a lot of the rest of it isn’t worth\ncollecting, and I’m not in a collecting mood, nor do I want a Modern\nLibrary man to start picking around in my spotty past” (E. B.

A Random House memorandum in July outlined a\npossible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American\nmarket. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in\nAmerica, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin\nobligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library\nPaperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August,\nCerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on\nthe situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own\npaper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands”\n(Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at\nthis point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer\nwrote Lane:\n\n> Almost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just\n> a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we\n> were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I’ll be\n> delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as\n> an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to\n> Lane, 28 August 1958).\n\nBut the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House\nexpanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with\nViking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin.\n\nThe Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original\npublishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February\n1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the\nModern Library’s contract for Conrad’s *Victory* and put it into an\nAnchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because *Victory*\nwas only five years away from entering the public domain. But other\nsignificant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking\nPress withdrew James Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in\n1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn. Ten new titles were added to the series. Seven titles were discontinued.\nTchekov, *Plays* (1930) was superseded by Chekhov *Best Plays* and\nVoltaire’s *Candide* (1918) was superseded by Voltaire’s *Candide and\nOther Writings.* This brought the total in the title list to 305. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green, or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine. $1.45.

Cerf asked Richard Watts, Jr., to edit *New Voices in the European\nTheatre* as a companion volume to the 1955 anthology, *New Voices in the\nAmerican Theatre* (Cerf to Watts, 11 October 1956). Watts was interested\nbut the book never appeared. John W. Aldridge suggested ten possible ML\ntitles, including a Wodehouse reader, Ford Madox Ford’s *The Good\nSoldier*, Malcolm Lowry’s *Under the Volcano*, a volume of Nathanael\nWest’s novels, the basic writings of Alfred North Whitehead, a Sherlock\nHolmes collection in the Giants, a Giant anthology of great short\nnovels, and an anthology of fiction by younger postwar writers (Aldridge\nto Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Stein liked the Wodehouse and great short\nnovels ideas and noted that Macmillan had turned down earlier proposals\nfor a Whitehead collection (Stein memo to Haydn, undated). Cerf thought\nthe Wodehouse and Whitehead collections and the great short novels and\npostwar fiction anthologies had possibilities (Cerf to Aldridge, 22\nAugust 1956).

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1957 1957 As costs rose steadily in the years following the war, retail prices\ninevitably had to be increased. Publishers at this period, however,\nfeared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off\nraising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no\nalternative. The $1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes\nremained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954.\nIt increased to $1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1\nJanuary 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65.\n\nAs long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library\nvolumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the\nModern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents\nper copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the\nretail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers\nto whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties\nwere going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no\ngeneral policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to\nbe paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only\nwhen pressure from individual authors and publishers left no\nalternative.\n\nIn 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in\nroyalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of\nLittle, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions.\n\nRandom House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause\nconcerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the\nModern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed\nfigure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s\nown authors in the event of price increases.\n\nSales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing\nsteadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark\nfor the first time in 1957. Ten titles were added and six discontinued, bringing the total number of\ntitles to 309.\n\nMolière’s *Plays* (1924) and Ibsen’s *Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of\nthe People* (1917) were superseded. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine. $1.65. The new retail price went into effect on 1 January, along with\nhigher prices for ML Giants and other RH publications such as Landmark\nBooks and *The American College Dictionary*. (Spring) Caesar, *Gallic War* xLewis, *Cass Timberlane*; Giants through\nG80 with G45 *Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers* and G31 Werfel, *Forty\nDays of Musa Dagh*; jackets: 379 (=fall 1957). (Fall) Lewis, *Cass\nTimberlane* xDescartes, *Philosophical Writings*; Giants through G80\nwith G31 *Famous Science–Fiction Stories*; jackets: 379 (=spring 1957). Cerf rejected an idea for a collection of Mark Twain short stories and\nsketches, stating “I don’t think it would sell well in the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Linscott, 7 December 1957). Ibsen, Henrik, *Six Plays* (490)\n\nMaugham, W. Somerset, *Best Short Stories* (491)\n\nHaggard, H. Rider, *She & King Solomon’s Mines* (492)\n\nCaesar, Julius, *Gallic War and Other Writings* (493)\n\nMichener, James, *Selected Writings* (494)\n\nMolière, *Eight Plays*, translated by Morris Bishop (495)\n\nThurber, James, *Thurber Carnival* (496)\n\nLoomis, Roger Sherman and Lewis, Laura Hibbard, eds., *Medieval\nRomances* (497)\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, *Notebooks* (498)\n\nLewis, Sinclair, *Cass Timberlane* (499) As costs rose steadily in the years following the war, retail prices\ninevitably had to be increased. Publishers at this period, however,\nfeared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off\nraising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no\nalternative. The $1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes\nremained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954.\nIt increased to $1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1\nJanuary 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65. [object Object]"

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1958 1958 In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A.\nKnopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the\nModern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason\nEpstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at\nDoubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books\npioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other\npublishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a\nbrilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the\npublishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who\nalso admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and\ndifficult to work with.\n\nPart of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an\nindependent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library,\nwhich Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make\nhis fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after\nseveral years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for\nModern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern\nLibrary itself.\n\nDespite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of\nthe series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another\nperson, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have\nsaved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have\naccelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital\nup-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been\nabandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or\nbecause to do the job right would have been too expensive for the\npotential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of\ncontemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s\nimage as a series of indisputably significant books.\n\nEpstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a\nchange from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the\nModern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had\nalways been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial\nsuccess had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series\nmight have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at\na minimum. Nine titles were added and six were discontinued. Swift’s *Gulliver’s\nTravels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (1931) was superseded\nby Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings.* This brought the\nlist of available titles to 312. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine. $1.65 Moses Hadas suggested a ML reprint of the edition of ten plays of\nEuripides that he and John Harvey McLean had translated (Dial Press,\n1936), but Penguin Books and New American Library had both recently\npublished inexpensive new translations and Jason Epstein thought the ML\nshould wait (Epstein to Hadas, 14 November 1958). In the end the ML\nreprinted the University of Chicago Press’s *Complete Greek Tragedie*s,\nedited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore (4 vols., 1959; ML reprint,\n7 volumes, 1960–63). Eric Bentley suggested a book of six Lope de Vega\nplays (Bentley to Epstein, 16 November 1958). Klopfer rejected a\nsuggestion to publish a new edition of *Democracy in America* as a ML\nGiant (Klopfer to Lerner, 13 November 1958).

      "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1959 1959 During the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had\nbeen immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a\nsteady upward climb. As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on\nthe verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959,\npublishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book\nCompany, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin,\nMacmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12\nOctober 1959, p. 27).\n\nOn 2 October 1959, Random House became a public corporation: 222,060\nshares of Random House stock were placed on sale at $11.25 a share. Cerf\nand Klopfer remained firmly in control of the firm; the stock sold to\nthe public represented only 30 percent of Random House’s total stock. As\na result of the sale, Cerf and Klopfer each received a check for more\nthan a million dollars.\n\nMaking Random House a public organization changed the nature of the\nbusiness. Cerf has written:\n\n> Suddenly Random House embarked on its financial career and expansion.\n> This marked a big change, since the minute you go public, outsiders\n> own some of your stock and you’ve got to make periodic reports to\n> them. You owe your investors dividends and profits. Instead of working\n> for yourself and doing what you damn please, willing to risk a loss on\n> something you want to do, if you’re any kind of honest man, you feel a\n> real responsibility to your stockholders. It was a very important\n> decision (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 277–78).\n\nThe following year, Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and its\noutstanding quality paperback line, Vintage Books. But while Random\nHouse and publishing in general were thriving, the 1950s marked the end\nof the growth of the Modern Library. By the mid-1960s, interest in the\nModern Library on the part of the public was low and the series was in\nserious trouble. Ten titles were added and two were discontinued, bringing the total to\n320. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine. $1.65 Jason Epstein, who moved from Alfred A. Knopf to Random House around\nthis time, had many ideas for the ML. He expressed interest in Samuel\nJohnson’s *Lives of the Poets*. He asked William Barnett and Morton\nWhite to edit a book on modern philosophy for ML Giants, indicating that\nit could sell 15,000–20,000 copies a year (Epstein to White, 24 February\n1959). Mark Van Doren, who had edited *The Poetry of John Dryden*\n(Harcourt, Brace & Howe, 1920) nearly forty years earlier, declined an\ninvitation to edit a collection of Dryden’s works for the ML (Van Doren\nto Epstein, 20 May 1959). Epstein asked William Arrowsmith, whose\ntranslation of Petronius, *Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press,\n1959) had recently appeared, to translate *Aristophanes* for the ML,\nindicating that he thought it would earn annual royalties between $500\nand $1,000 (Epstein to Arrowsmith, 23 October 1959). He invited F. W.\nDupee to translate a selection of the works of the Marquis de Sade for\nthe ML; as a second choice he expressed interest in a translation of\nFlaubert’s *Sentimental Education* (Epstein to Dupee, 17 November 1959).\n\nCerf wanted to include the one-volume edition of James George Frazer’s\n*The Golden Bough* (Macmillan, 1922) in ML Giants and asked C. Edgar\nPhreaner Jr. to seek rights (Phreaner to Cerf, 27 July 1959). He offered\nLittle, Brown an advance of $6,000 for Edith Hamilton, *Mythology*,\noriginally published in 1942 (Cerf to Arthur Thornhill, 26 October\n1959), and he asked Professor William Alfred of Harvard University about\ntranslations for a volume of Middle English literature for the ML,\nsaying “It would be a good idea, I think, for the Modern Library to\ninclude an Anthology of this type” (Cerf to Alfred, 17 November 1959).\nNone of these works were added to the ML.\n\nSeveral of Epstein’s suggestions resulted in additions to the series: *A\nKierkegaard Anthology* (1959: 518), Dickens, *Our Mutual Friend* (1960:\n524), and the Bernard Guilbert Guerney translation of Turgenev, *Fathers\nand Sons* (1917: 20.2a), which replaced the Constance Garnett\ntranslation in the ML in 1961 (Epstein to Klopfer, 12 January 1959).\nOther titles suggested by Epstein included Goodspeed’s translation of\n*The Apocrypha* (1962: 541), *The Space Handbook* (ML Paperbacks,\nNovember 1959), and Bernard Malamud’s *The Magic Barrel* (ML Paperbacks,\nApril 1960).\n\nEpstein offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for\nreprint rights to the William Arrowsmith translation of Petronius,\n*Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press, 1959) but withdrew the offer\nwhen he discovered that a paperback edition would be published by Mentor\nBooks (Epstein to Fred D. Wieck, 30 November 1959). *An Anthology of\nRussian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak*, edited\nby Bernard Guilbert Guerney, was considered for the ML but was published\nin 1960 as a Random House trade book. Other titles considered included\nE. M. W. Tillyard, *The Elizabethan World Picture*; Jacob Bronowski,\n*The Common Sense of Science*; and *Five Plays* of Eugene O’Neill. *A\nDocumentary History of Communism*, edited by Robert V. Daniels, was\nconsidered for the ML but was postponed (Minutes of ML Meeting, 5\nFebruary 1959); it ended up being published in two volumes in Vintage\nBooks.\n\nEpstein wanted to strengthen the ML’s offerings of poetry. He suggested\nvolumes devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer, the Cavalier Poets (Thomas Carew,\nSir John Suckling, and Richard Lovelace) and collections of the poetry\nof Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Samuel\nJohnson, Christopher Smart, W. S. Landor, Robert Burns, Rudyard Kipling,\nThomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also suggested publishing\nseveral longer poems as separate ML volumes, including Wordsworth’s *The\nPrelude*, Browning’s *The Ring and the Book*, Edmund Spenser’s *The\nFaerie Queen*, and the narrative poems of William Butler Yeats (Epstein\nto Andrew Chiappe, 6 February 1959). None of these proposals came to\nfruition.\n\nCharles Singleton, professor of humanities studies at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, signed a contract to prepare a new translation of Dante’s\n*Divine Comedy* for the ML, for which he received a $3,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 6½ percent of the retail price. In the end the\nproject took longer than expected and expanded beyond the single volume\nthat the ML anticipated. Singleton’s edition was published in six\nvolumes by Princeton University Press between 1970 and 1975. Each of the\nthree parts—*Inferno*, *Purgatorio*, and *Paradiso—*consisted of a\nvolume containing the Italian text and Singleton’s translation and a\nvolume of commentary by Singleton.\n\nEpstein was also looking for new translations of several works that were\nalready in the ML. The Ennis Rees translations of Homer’s *Iliad* (1929:\n186.2) and *Odyssey* (1929: 187.2), published by Random House in 1960\nand 1963, replaced the 19th-century translations of Lang, Leaf and Myers\nand Butcher and Lang in the ML between 1962 and 1964. The Samuel Putnam\ntranslation of Cervantes, *Don Quixote*, published by Viking Press in\ntwo volumes in 1949, replaced the Ozell revision of the Motteux\ntranslation in 1964 in the regular ML and ML Giants.\n\nOther works that Epstein wanted to include in the ML were *Hindu,\nBuddhist, and Confucian Traditions* by Theodore de Bary, *Japanese\nPlays* by Donald Keene, and the forthcoming edition of Pushkin’s *Eugene\nOnegin,* translated with commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (Bollingen\nFoundation, 1964). Also being sought were new translations of Homer’s\n*Odyssey* and *Iliad* and the University of Chicago’s translations of\nGreek Drama (Epstein to Cerf, 3 September 1959). The ML reprinted the\nChicago edition of *The Complete Greek Tragedies* in seven volumes\nbetween 1960 and 1963.\n\nAndrew Chiappe suggested Livy’s *Hannibal’s Campaign*, Tolstoy’s\n*Essays*, Balzac’s *Lost Illusions*, and Terence’s *Comedies* (Chiappe,\nNovember 1959). Epstein intended to add Sir Philip Sidney’s *Arcadia*,\nfor which he paid William G. Miller $500 for editing work (Epstein to\nMiller 9 November 1959). Of these only Tolstoy, *Selected Essays* (1964:\n564) and Balzac, *Lost Illusions* (1967: G109) appeared in the ML.\n\nKlopfer asked Macmillan for reprint rights to Margaret Mitchell’s *Gone\nwith the Wind* for ML Giants. Macmillan considered the offer seriously\nbut Bruce Brett, the president of the firm, concluded that “this is not\nthe time for it” (Brett to Klopfer, 15 December 1959).\n\nJohn Clive, whose *Macaulay: The Shaping of a Historian* would be\npublished by Knopf in 1973, suggested a ML selection of Macaulay’s\nworks. Epstein declined the proposal, noting that ML titles had to sell\n“a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 copies a year for a considerable period,\nwhich means that it has to be assigned to undergraduates in fairly\nsubstantial numbers” (Epstein to Clive, 15 September 1959). *Modern Library Dictionary* (1959–1970) 509\n\nAuden, *Selected Poetry* (1959–1971) 510\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein, *Six Plays* (1959– ) 511\n\nWeidman, *I Can Get It for You Wholesale* (1959–1971) 512\n\nJung, *Basic Writings* (1959– ) 513\n\nBierstedt, ed., *Making of Society* (1959–1974) 514\n\nVasari, *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects*\n(1959–1970) 515\n\nSalinger, *Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516\n\nHoward, *World’s Great Operas* (1959–1970) 517\n\nKierkegaard, *Kierkegaard Anthology* (1959– ) 518 During the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had\nbeen immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a\nsteady upward climb. As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on\nthe verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959,\npublishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book\nCompany, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin,\nMacmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12\nOctober 1959, p. 27).
