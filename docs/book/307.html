<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
When the completed trilogy, <em>U. S. A.</em>, of which <em>The 42nd Parallel</em>
is the introductory novel, will have been published in the Modern
Library, John Dos Passos will have gained the distinction of being
represented by four titles in the series. <em>Three Soldiers</em> (No. 205),
his war novel, has been in active demand for years. Following the
publication of <em>The 42nd Parallel</em>, <em>1919</em> and <em>The Big Money</em> will be
issued in successive seasons. By this plan, John Dos Passos’ original
intention of maintaining the unity of the three novels will be
fulfilled. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1930; rights subsequently
acquired by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. ML edition of <em>The 42nd Parallel</em>
printed from plates made from a new Harcourt, Brace typesetting with
revisions by the author. The plates were subsequently used for the
one-volume edition of <em>U.S.A.</em> published by Harcourt, Brace in January
1938 and reprinted in ML Giants in 1939. Published 10 November 1937.
<em>WR</em> 13 November 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall
1940 after the ML published <em>U.S.A.</em> as a Giant (G42).</p>
<p>The ML signed a contract with Harcourt, Brace to publish <em>The 42nd
Parallel</em>, <em>Nineteen Nineteen</em>, and <em>The Big Money</em> in the regular ML in
the fall seasons of 1937, 1938, and 1939 (Cerf to Dos Passos, 23 June
1937). The ML appears to have offered a $1,000 advance against royalties
of 10 cents a copy for each volume. Cerf indicated after signing the
reprint contract, “I am really delighted that we are going to have these
books in the Modern Library. John Dos Passos is exactly the kind of
author that we can sell in this series” (Cerf to Donald Brace, 13 May
1937).</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace reset <em>The 42nd Parallel</em>, incorporating corrections of
a large number of typographical errors submitted by Dos Passos. The ML
edition was the first printing from the new typesetting. Dos Passos had
also made extensive revisions for the ML edition of <em>Three Soldiers</em>
(248).</p>
<p>Cerf asked Dos Passos to write a short foreword to the ML edition of
<em>The 42nd Parallel</em>, noting that he believed his foreword to the ML
edition of <em>Three Soldiers</em> (248) “materially helped the sale of the
book.” He offered the usual $50 fee with the apology that the ML
couldn’t afford more but enclosed a ML list and invited Dos Passos to
select any books he wanted (Cerf to Dos Passos, ibid.). Dos Passos
eventually selected about a hundred titles. He promised to send a short
introduction and noted, “I’m not quite sure whether this is the time to
spill the fact that the narratives will be collected into a one volume
novel under the name of <em>U.S.A.</em> or not” (Dos Passos to Cerf, 4 July
1937).</p>
<p>The introduction to the ML edition, dated July 1937, begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The 42nd Parallel</em> is the first volume of <em>U. S. A.</em>, a long
narrative which deals with the more or less entangled lives of a
number of Americans during the first three decades of the present
century. The volumes that follow are called <em>1919</em> and <em>The Big
Money</em>.</p>
<p>In an effort to take in as much as possible of the broad field of the
lives of these times, three separate sequences have been threaded in
and out among the stories. Of these <em>The Camera Eye</em> aims to indicate
the position of the observer and <em>Newsreel</em> to give an inkling of the
common mind of the epoch. Portraits of a number of real people are
interlarded in the pauses in the narrative because their lives seem to
embody so well the quality of the soil in which Americans of these
generations grew.</p>
<p>This method was used with the idea of coping with the particular job
in hand rather than from any generalized theory about novelwriting
[<em>sic</em>]. In fact I don’t think any such theory holds water. The
shape of a piece of work should be imposed, and in a good piece of
work always is imposed, by the matter. That’s more or less of a
commonplace of a considerable body of literary criticism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML later renegotiated the reprint contract so that the trilogy could
appear as a Giant rather than separate volumes in the regular ML.
<em>U.S.A.</em> (G42) was published as a Giant in February 1939, and <em>The 42nd
Parallel</em> was discontinued as a separate volume in fall 1940.</p>

The ML appears to have offered a $1,000 advance against royalties\nof 10 cents a copy for each volume. Cerf indicated after signing the\nreprint contract, “I am really delighted that we are going to have these\nbooks in the Modern Library. John Dos Passos is exactly the kind of\nauthor that we can sell in this series” (Cerf to Donald Brace, 13 May\n1937).\n\nHarcourt, Brace reset *The 42nd Parallel*, incorporating corrections of\na large number of typographical errors submitted by Dos Passos. The ML\nedition was the first printing from the new typesetting. Dos Passos had\nalso made extensive revisions for the ML edition of *Three Soldiers*\n(248).\n\nCerf asked Dos Passos to write a short foreword to the ML edition of\n*The 42nd Parallel*, noting that he believed his foreword to the ML\nedition of *Three Soldiers* (248) “materially helped the sale of the\nbook.” He offered the usual $50 fee with the apology that the ML\ncouldn’t afford more but enclosed a ML list and invited Dos Passos to\nselect any books he wanted (Cerf to Dos Passos, ibid.). Dos Passos\neventually selected about a hundred titles. He promised to send a short\nintroduction and noted, “I’m not quite sure whether this is the time to\nspill the fact that the narratives will be collected into a one volume\nnovel under the name of *U.S.A.* or not” (Dos Passos to Cerf, 4 July\n1937).\n\nThe introduction to the ML edition, dated July 1937, begins:\n\n> *The 42nd Parallel* is the first volume of *U. S. A.*, a long\n> narrative which deals with the more or less entangled lives of a\n> number of Americans during the first three decades of the present\n> century. The volumes that follow are called *1919* and *The Big\n> Money*.\n>\n> In an effort to take in as much as possible of the broad field of the\n> lives of these times, three separate sequences have been threaded in\n> and out among the stories. Of these *The Camera Eye* aims to indicate\n> the position of the observer and *Newsreel* to give an inkling of the\n> common mind of the epoch. Portraits of a number of real people are\n> interlarded in the pauses in the narrative because their lives seem to\n> embody so well the quality of the soil in which Americans of these\n> generations grew.\n>\n> This method was used with the idea of coping with the particular job\n> in hand rather than from any generalized theory about novelwriting\n> \\[*sic*\\]. In fact I don’t think any such theory holds water. The\n> shape of a piece of work should be imposed, and in a good piece of\n> work always is imposed, by the matter. That’s more or less of a\n> commonplace of a considerable body of literary criticism.\n\nThe ML later renegotiated the reprint contract so that the trilogy could\nappear as a Giant rather than separate volumes in the regular ML.\n*U.S.A.* (G42) was published as a Giant in February 1939, and *The 42nd\nParallel* was discontinued as a separate volume in fall 1940.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (1932–1963) 248\n\nDos Passos, *U.S.A.* (1939–1962) G42",
