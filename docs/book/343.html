<p><strong>LUDWIG BEMELMANS. MY WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES. 1941–1948. (ML 175)</strong></p>
<h4><a href='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/revision/343.html'>343. First printing (1941)</a></h4>
<p>Ludwig Bemelmans | My War with the United States | Illustrated by the
Author | The Modern Library | New York | [drawing of fort and cannon
with turret of fort extending upward to the left of place of
publication]</p>
<p>Pp. [<em>2</em>], [1–8] 9–151 [152–158]. [1–10]<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>[<em>1</em>–<em>2</em>] blank; [1] half title; [2] blank; [3] title; [4]
COPYRIGHT, 1937, BY LUDWIG BEMELMANS | FIRST <em>Modern Library</em> EDITION,
1941; [5] Contents; [6] blank; [7] fly title; [8] blank; 9–10
Foreword; 11–151 text; [152–158] blank. <em>Note:</em> <em>First</em> statement
retained on all printings. The first printing is on thicker paper than
most of the later printings, and there is no list of titles inside the
jacket.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), moderate yellow
(87) and black on cream paper with drawing of a fort and cannon in black
and moderate greenish blue against moderate yellow background; lettering
in black except last two words of title in moderate greenish blue
outlined in black. Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition
with a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN
LIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot
of the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML
jacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the
Bemelmans drawing on the title page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own
foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ <em>My War with the United States</em> fulfils
that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It
persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American
Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and
wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its
illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and
civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a
reprint edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. [3],
[5]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the
Viking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published
October 1941. <em>WR</em> 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued fall 1948.</p>
<p>The verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,
“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway
Printing Company Paper by Richard Bauer &amp; Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The
ML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset
department before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that
specialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its
standard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible
that Parkway subcontracted the job.</p>
<p>There are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a
ML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were
printed from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset
printing.</p>
<p>The jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and
the inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings
of the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring
1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so
they could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.</p>
<p>The ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl
Harbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings
are on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to
enhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset
lithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of
wartime paper shortages.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and

First printing (1941)\n\nLudwig Bemelmans | My War with the United States | Illustrated by the\nAuthor | The Modern Library | New York | \\[drawing of fort and cannon\nwith turret of fort extending upward to the left of place of\npublication\\]\n\nPp. \\[*2*\\], \\[1–8\\] 9–151 \\[152–158\\]. \\[1–10\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\n\\[*1*–*2*\\] blank; \\[1\\] half title; \\[2\\] blank; \\[3\\] title; \\[4\\]\nCOPYRIGHT, 1937, BY LUDWIG BEMELMANS | FIRST *Modern Library* EDITION,\n1941; \\[5\\] Contents; \\[6\\] blank; \\[7\\] fly title; \\[8\\] blank; 9–10\nForeword; 11–151 text; \\[152–158\\] blank. *Note:* *First* statement\nretained on all printings. The first printing is on thicker paper than\nmost of the later printings, and there is no list of titles inside the\njacket.\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), moderate yellow\n(87) and black on cream paper with drawing of a fort and cannon in black\nand moderate greenish blue against moderate yellow background; lettering\nin black except last two words of title in moderate greenish blue\noutlined in black. Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition\nwith a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN\nLIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot\nof the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML\njacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the\nBemelmans drawing on the title page.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own\n> foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ *My War with the United States* fulfils\n> that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It\n> persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American\n> Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and\n> wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its\n> illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and\n> civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a\n> reprint edition.\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. \\[3\\],\n\\[5\\]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published\nOctober 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1948.\n\nThe verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,\n“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway\nPrinting Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The\nML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that\nspecialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its\nstandard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible\nthat Parkway subcontracted the job.\n\nThere are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a\nML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were\nprinted from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset\nprinting.\n\nThe jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and\nthe inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings\nof the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring\n1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so\nthey could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.\n\nThe ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl\nHarbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings\nare on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to\nenhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset\nlithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of\nwartime paper shortages.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and\nGiant titles.",

The first printing is on thicker paper than\nmost of the later printings, and there is no list of titles inside the\njacket.\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), moderate yellow\n(87) and black on cream paper with drawing of a fort and cannon in black\nand moderate greenish blue against moderate yellow background; lettering\nin black except last two words of title in moderate greenish blue\noutlined in black. Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition\nwith a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN\nLIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot\nof the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML\njacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the\nBemelmans drawing on the title page.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own\n> foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ *My War with the United States* fulfils\n> that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It\n> persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American\n> Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and\n> wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its\n> illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and\n> civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a\n> reprint edition.\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. \\[3\\],\n\\[5\\]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published\nOctober 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1948.\n\nThe verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,\n“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway\nPrinting Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The\nML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that\nspecialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its\nstandard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible\nthat Parkway subcontracted the job.\n\nThere are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a\nML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were\nprinted from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset\nprinting.\n\nThe jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and\nthe inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings\nof the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring\n1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so\nthey could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.\n\nThe ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl\nHarbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings\nare on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to\nenhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset\nlithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of\nwartime paper shortages.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and\nGiant titles."
