<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Readers of <em>The General</em> and <em>Captain Horatio Hornblower</em> will welcome
the revival of <em>The African Queen</em> in the Modern Library series. In
C. S. Forester’s happiest vein, this fabulous tale maintains from
first page to last its breathless excitement. An asthmatic steam
launch carries a timid Cockney and a maidenly English missionary on a
river in Central Africa to the adventure of their lives. Romance
triumphs over fate, tropical heat and whizzing bullets. <em>The African
Queen</em> is a story to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a
lifetime. (<em>Fall 1940</em>)</p>
<p>Front flap reset with last sentence revised:</p>
<p>“<em>The African Queen</em> is a story of high adventure and suspense, to be
read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime.” (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1935, with the last
four chapters of the British edition omitted. ML edition (pp. [1]–275)
printed from Little, Brown plates with the last four chapters restored.
Chapters 16–19 (pp. 276–[308]) printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published September 1940. <em>WR</em> 14 September 1940. First
printing: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf had never read <em>The African Queen</em>. He asked Little, Brown for a
copy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about
an hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that
it was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B.
McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown
royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years
before the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.</p>
<p>Forester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters
omitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the
foreword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in
writing another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the
end of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end
without calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was
called for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and
it was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I
really appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked
of its last two [<em>sic</em>] chapters. . . . So it is with very great
pleasure that I welcome this reissue of <em>The African Queen</em> for the
opportunity it gives me of presenting the book in the form in which I
first pictured it” (p. [<em>8</em>]).</p>

ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–275)\nprinted from Little, Brown plates with the last four chapters restored.\nChapters 16–19 (pp. 276–\\[308\\]) printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First\nprinting: 5,000 copies.\n\nCerf had never read *The African Queen*. He asked Little, Brown for a\ncopy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about\nan hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that\nit was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B.\nMcIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years\nbefore the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.\n\nForester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters\nomitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940).
