<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Included in every list of great books are Cicero’s orations. For a
long time the editors of the Modern Library have cherished the hope of
bringing into the series not only the orations, but the essays and
letters of Cicero within the compass of a single compact volume. Only
when Professor Hadas provided the means by which the writings of one
of the greatest of the Romans could be presented in the best of a
variety of translations was this aim achieved. Now such essays as “On
Moral Duties,” “On Old Age,” “Scipio’s Dream” and “On the Character of
the Orator” and the orations “Against Catiline” and the “Second
Philippic,” as well as a generous assortment of Letters, make a volume
of immense value to the scholar and general reader alike. (<em>Spring
1951</em>)</p>
