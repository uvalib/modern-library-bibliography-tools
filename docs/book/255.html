<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Of the vast library of books devoted to the deeds and personality of Napoleon Bonaparte, none has had such an immense popular success as Emil Ludwig’s vibrant biography. The reason is not far to seek. Upon the framework of historical fact, Ludwig has re-created the whole miraculous cycle of Napoleon’s life and has imbued it with the passion and imagination that motivated the career of the little Corsican. It is a book of courage and violence, as vivid and as stirring as Napoleon’s victories and ultimate humiliation. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eden and Cedar Paul translation originally published in U.S. by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1926. ML edition printed from Liveright plates made from a new typesetting which appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published March 1933. <em>WR</em> 25 March 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The original B&amp;L plates were too large for the ML’s format.</p>
<p><em>Napoleon</em> sold 7,309 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

(*Spring 1933*)   \n\n> Front flap:<br> Of the vast library of books devoted to the deeds and personality of Napoleon Bonaparte, none has had such an immense popular success as Emil Ludwig’s vibrant biography. The reason is not far to seek. Upon the framework of historical fact, Ludwig has re-created the whole miraculous cycle of Napoleon’s life and has imbued it with the passion and imagination that motivated the career of the little Corsican. It is a book of courage and violence, as vivid and as stirring as Napoleon’s victories and ultimate humiliation. (*Spring 1939*)   \n\nEden and Cedar Paul translation originally published in U.S. by Boni & Liveright, 1926. ML edition printed from Liveright plates made from a new typesetting which appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published March 1933. *WR* 25 March 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.   \n\nThe original B&L plates were too large for the ML’s format.   \n\n*Napoleon* sold 7,309 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\n#### 255b.

(*Spring 1933*)   \n\n> Front flap:<br> Of the vast library of books devoted to the deeds and personality of Napoleon Bonaparte, none has had such an immense popular success as Emil Ludwig’s vibrant biography. The reason is not far to seek. Upon the framework of historical fact, Ludwig has re-created the whole miraculous cycle of Napoleon’s life and has imbued it with the passion and imagination that motivated the career of the little Corsican. It is a book of courage and violence, as vivid and as stirring as Napoleon’s victories and ultimate humiliation. (*Spring 1939*)   \n\nEden and Cedar Paul translation originally published in U.S. by Boni & Liveright, 1926. ML edition printed from Liveright plates made from a new typesetting which appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published March 1933. *WR* 25 March 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.   \n\nThe original B&L plates were too large for the ML’s format.   \n\n*Napoleon* sold 7,309 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\n"
