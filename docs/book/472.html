<p>Front flap:<br> The basic concepts of present-day psychoanalysis—both as to theory and to therapy—are contained in this book. Beginning with Freud’s cornerstone formulations, the <em>Outline of Psychoanalysis</em> presents a clear and accurate picture of all the major developments in the field. Here the reader will find authoritative statements by Freud, Adler, Jung, Reich, Abraham, Sullivan, Horney, Alexander, and other distinguished figures too numerous to list.
For an understanding of man’s nature and development, his goals and difficulties, his driving forces and defenses—for this and more, the reader will do well to know the substance of this book. (Spring 1955)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Outline of Psychoanalysis</em>, edited by J. S. Van Teslaar (108). Published spring 1955. <em>WR</em> 25 June 1955. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The revision of <em>An Outline of Psychoanalysis</em>, originally published in 1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision of <em>An Outline of Abnormal Psychology</em> (172). Clara Thompson, Executive Director of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology, was recommended by Gardner Murphy shortly after he agreed to revise <em>An Outline of Abnormal Psychology</em> (Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953).</p>
<p>Thompson and her fellow editors tried to present “the many approaches which go to make up a science such as psychoanalysis” (p. [ix]) but ran into major obstacles in securing permissions. W. W. Norton, the publisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to allow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton expressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the original editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not to have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to Stein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was disturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing (Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by these authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to include them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word.</p>
<p>Anna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to appear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections by their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The Emotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.” Gitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative table of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by &amp; large, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of psychoanalysis.” He continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel, Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the standpoint from which I view it. . . .
Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the “interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book, <em>The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense</em>. “My reason for this,” she wrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the other contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter would create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July 1954). Stein replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In planning the <em>Outline of Psychoanalysis</em>, we have tried to represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to a proper view of psychoanalysis. The other category in the collection is controversial material. We have tried to present some impression of the differing viewpoints that now exist. . . . Consequently, many people who differ on a scientific basis with each other will appear in this volume without there being any suggestion that one is right and the other wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He offered to include a statement in the book “explaining that many different viewpoints are represented here and that the presence of any particular writer’s material . . . does not imply an endorsement of the views expressed by other writers in the book” (Stein to Freud, 8 July 1954). But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your arguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part” (Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954).</p>

(Spring 1955) \n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, edited by J. S. Van Teslaar (108). Published spring 1955. *WR* 25 June 1955. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nThe revision of *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*, originally published in 1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision of *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* (172). Clara Thompson, Executive Director of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology, was recommended by Gardner Murphy shortly after he agreed to revise *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* (Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953). \n\nThompson and her fellow editors tried to present “the many approaches which go to make up a science such as psychoanalysis” (p. [ix]) but ran into major obstacles in securing permissions. W. W. Norton, the publisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to allow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton expressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the original editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not to have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to Stein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was disturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing (Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by these authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to include them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word. \n\nAnna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to appear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections by their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The Emotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.” Gitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative table of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by & large, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of psychoanalysis.” He continued: \n\n> All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel, Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the standpoint from which I view it. . . . \n> Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the “interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954). \n\nAnna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book, *The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense*. “My reason for this,” she wrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the other contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter would create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July 1954). Stein replied: \n\n> In planning the *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, we have tried to represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to a proper view of psychoanalysis. The other category in the collection is controversial material. We have tried to present some impression of the differing viewpoints that now exist. . . . Consequently, many people who differ on a scientific basis with each other will appear in this volume without there being any suggestion that one is right and the other wrong. \n\nHe offered to include a statement in the book “explaining that many different viewpoints are represented here and that the presence of any particular writer’s material . . . does not imply an endorsement of the views expressed by other writers in the book” (Stein to Freud, 8 July 1954). But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your arguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part” (Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \n*Outline of Psychoanalysis,* ed.
