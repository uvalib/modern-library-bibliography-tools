<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“No more savage book was ever written,” says Carl Van Doren of
<em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>. Far from being the children’s book that
simple-minded people have made it, Swift’s fierce satire burns with
hatred and revenge. It is a book for adults who must perceive beyond
the record of imaginary travels among pygmies and giants an account of
mankind in all its silly, vicious and hypocritical posturings.
Included in this volume are Swift’s bitter comedies <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>
and <em>The Battle of the Books</em>. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
March 1931. <em>WR</em> 28 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained.
Superseded 1958 by <em>Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings</em> (502).</p>
<p>The text of <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>, according to the Prefatory Note, “is
substantially that of the second edition, with the corrections in Ford’s
interleaved copy” (p. v). The text of <em>Tale of a Tub</em> and <em>Battle of the
Books</em> “is based on that of the fifth edition published in 1710.
Together with the original notes from this edition are given a few from
Hawkesworth’s edition of Swift’s Works (1755–75) and from Sir Walter
Scott’s (1814); these are marked respectively with the initial H and S”
(p. vi). Van Doren received the ML’s standard $50 fee for writing the
introduction.</p>
<p><em>Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books</em> sold
5,463 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not
rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> As 212b with deep brown (56) in place of moderate blue and
series and torchbearer in deep green (142).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
At whatever age <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> may be read, it opens new worlds
to the imagination. For the child this chronicle of fabulous travels
among pygmies and giants is an adventure in strange encounters and
dramatic conflicts. For the adult it is a commentary and revelation on
the mind and behavior of mankind in all its frauds and attempts at
honesty, its fatuous and earnest struggles to live in some kind of
amity and its preposterous posturings. It is fierce satire with rich
meanings for every age and circumstance; it is pure fantasy and
startling reality that explores and exposes the frailty of man.
Included in this volume are Swift’s bitterly ironic comedies <em>A Tale
of a Tub</em> and <em>The Battle of the Books</em>. (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in light greenish blue (172) and deep purple (224)

background in light greenish blue. Front flap reverts to 212a text.
(<em>Fall 1955</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.
