<p>Front flap:<br>
The few, exquisitely wrought tales written by Katherine Anne Porter
have firmly established her reputation as one of the masters of the
short-story form. Critics have vied with one another in lavishing
their praise for the crystalline quality of her prose, and her public
has grown in ever-widening circles, until now the devotees of her
writings include the most discriminating readers in America.
<em>Flowering Judas and Other Stories</em> takes an honored place on the
Modern Library shelf as a collection of short tales worthy of the
illustrious company of great writers already represented in the
series. (<em>Fall 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B (ML 284):</em> Pictorial in pale green (149), deep red (13) and
black on cream paper with illustration from jacket A reduced in size and
printed in deep red and black at lower right with portion of design
uncolored; lettering in black on background printed in pale green at top
and deep red at foot. Front flap as jacket A through second sentence;
third sentence replaced by the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Flowering Judas and Other Stories</em> and <em>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</em>
(Number 45) are the two collections of tales by Katherine Anne Porter
in the Modern Library. Both rank high in the honored company of
world-famous writers of short stories represented in the series.
(<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1935. ML edition (pp.
[<em>9</em>]–285) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published September
1940 as ML 88. <em>WR</em> 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1950; restored spring 1953 as ML 284. Discontinued
1970/71.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $250 advance, and Porter received $25 for
her introduction. In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a
copy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was
pleased that <em>Flowering Judas</em> was to be included in the series. She
wrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I
hope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a
buyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library
a God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have
more.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly,
a kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book;
authors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little
on the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8
May 1940).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943.
There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier
that year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book
sells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of
letting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).</p>
<p>When Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint
series, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was
terminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S.
Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400
copies of <em>Flowering Judas</em> in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it
would take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3
June 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued
in fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s
<em>Light in August</em> (429), which was published in the series shortly after
<em>Flowering Judas</em> was discontinued.</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including <em>Flowering Judas</em>
in Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring
1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and
assigned <em>Flowering Judas</em> a new number (ML 284). Some copies of the
1946 ML printing that remained in the warehouse were sold in the spring
1953 jacket.</p>

Discontinued\n1970/71.\n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $250 advance, and Porter received $25 for\nher introduction. In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was\npleased that *Flowering Judas* was to be included in the series. She\nwrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I\nhope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a\nbuyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library\na God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have\nmore.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly,\na kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book;\nauthors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little\non the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8\nMay 1940).\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943.\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier\nthat year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book\nsells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of\nletting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).\n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was\nterminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S.\nSpencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400\ncopies of *Flowering Judas* in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it\nwould take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3\nJune 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued\nin fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s\n*Light in August* (429), which was published in the series shortly after\n*Flowering Judas* was discontinued.\n\nHarcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including *Flowering Judas*\nin Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring\n1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and\nassigned *Flowering Judas* a new number (ML 284). Some copies of the\n1946 ML printing that remained in the warehouse were sold in the spring\n1953 jacket.\n\n#### 333b.
