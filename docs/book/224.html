<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
After centuries, the derisive phrase “It’s a Marco Polo,” to indicate
a gross exaggeration, has been revised to convey the highest tribute
for accuracy and veracity. The merchant-traveller from Venice was the
first to cross the entire continent of Asia and to open one of the
main routes to China. The record of his adventures and explorations is
as fabulous as the truth. His is a travel book that time has
substantiated. Readers have enjoyed it with a zest worthy of the
Venetian nomad himself. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
