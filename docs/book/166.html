<em>Swann’s Way</em> is the first volume of Marcel Proust’s life work,
<em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>. Independently, it is a unique and
stimulating novel, but in a larger sense, it is an overture to a
magnificent symphony, announcing its theme and mood and bringing into
being its empire of notable character creations. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Swann’s Way</em>, the first volume of Proust’s great seven-volume
masterpiece <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>, was first published in
France in 1913, at Proust’s own expense. The most popular of his
books, it stands alone as a unique recreation of what was actually
Proust’s own childhood. Swann, the focal character, is the son of a
stockbroker and has entered into an “unfortunate” marriage. Marcel,
the narrator, remembers that his family’s guests during the early
period of his life were practically limited to Swann, who, like the
other people in Marcel’s early memories, seemed to him to be
“abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great
chestnut-tree.”</p>
<p>“If I think of it,” says Marcel at the end of <em>Remembrance of Things
Past</em>, “the substance of my experience came to me through Swann.”</p>
