<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>  <em>Swann’s Way</em>, the first volume of Proust’s great seven-volume masterpiece <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>, was first published in France in 1913, at Proust’s own expense. The most popular of his books, it stands alone as a unique recreation of what was actually  Proust’s own childhood. Swann, the focal character, is the son of a stockbroker and has entered into an “unfortunate” marriage. Marcel, the narrator, remembers that his family’s guests during the early period of his life were practically limited to Swann, who, like the  other people in Marcel’s early memories, seemed to him to be “abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree.”   If I think of it,” says Marcel at the end of <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>, “the substance of my experience came to me through Swann.”</p>

Independently, it is a unique and stimulating novel, but in a larger sense, it is an overture to a magnificent symphony, announcing its theme and mood and bringing into being its empire of notable character creations. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. in two volumes by Henry Holt & Co., 1922, using imported sheets of the Chatto & Windus edition. Published in one volume by Albert & Charles Boni, 1930; using plates made from a new typesetting. ML edition printed from Boni plates. Published November 1928. *WR* 1 December 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1977–1982.  \n\nKlopfer initially offered royalties of 5 cents a copy, then increased the offer to 8 cents (Klopfer to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 23 March 1928 and 29 March 1928).  \n\nThe ML edition sold nearly 30,000 copies during its first four years with annual sales as follows: 11,874 copies; 8,854 copies; 5,395 copies; and 3,513 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *Swann’s Way* was high in the third quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. Sales increased significantly during the early 1950s. It ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952  \n\n#### 166.1b.

The most popular of his books, it stands alone as a unique recreation of what was actually  Proust’s own childhood. Swann, the focal character, is the son of a stockbroker and has entered into an “unfortunate” marriage. Marcel, the narrator, remembers that his family’s guests during the early period of his life were practically limited to Swann, who, like the  other people in Marcel’s early memories, seemed to him to be “abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree.”   If I think of it,” says Marcel at the end of *Remembrance of Things Past*, “the substance of my experience came to me through Swann.”  \n\nPublished fall 1977 at \\$5.95.
