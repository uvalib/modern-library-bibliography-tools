<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Best American Humorous Short Stories</em>, ed. Alexander Jessup (1920). Published fall 1945. <em>WR</em> 17 November 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Linscott became a Random House editor in 1944 after a long career at Houghton Mifflin. His work on <em>Best American Humorous Short Stories</em> was not part of his regular responsibilities, and he received a $250 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy (Cerf to Linscott, 19 January 1945). Jessup’s anthology had an average sale of 1,500–2,000 copies a year before the Second World War. Linscott expected the revised edition to sell over 5,000 copies in the first year and then gradually decline to the same level as the earlier anthology. He predicted a total sale of 20,000–30,000 copies before it needed to be revised again (Linscott to R. Hawley Traux, <em>New Yorker</em>, 1 March 1945).</p>
<p><em>Best American Humorous Short Stories</em> sold 3,643 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

(*Fall 1945; [Fall 1963]*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Best American Humorous Short Stories*, ed. Alexander Jessup (1920). Published fall 1945. *WR* 17 November 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nLinscott became a Random House editor in 1944 after a long career at Houghton Mifflin. His work on *Best American Humorous Short Stories* was not part of his regular responsibilities, and he received a \\$250 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy (Cerf to Linscott, 19 January 1945). Jessup’s anthology had an average sale of 1,500–2,000 copies a year before the Second World War. Linscott expected the revised edition to sell over 5,000 copies in the first year and then gradually decline to the same level as the earlier anthology. He predicted a total sale of 20,000–30,000 copies before it needed to be revised again (Linscott to R. Hawley Traux, *New Yorker*, 1 March 1945). \n\n*Best American Humorous Short Stories* sold 3,643 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. \n\n",
