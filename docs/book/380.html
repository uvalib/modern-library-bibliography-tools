Forty-three stories are included in this collection; the work of

Thurber and S. J. Perlman, and including such top-flight performers as
Dorothy Parker, Ring Lardner, Donald Ogden Stewart, Robert Benchley,
Frank Sullivan, Sally Benson and Arthur Kober. It’s an all-star cast
that contains [±offers] the best work of the present-day humorists,
and as many selections from those of the past as the average
contemporary is likely to enjoy. (<em>Fall 1945; [Fall 1963]</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Best American Humorous Short
Stories</em>, ed. Alexander Jessup (1920). Published fall 1945. <em>WR</em> 17
November 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Linscott became a Random House editor in 1944 after a long career at
Houghton Mifflin. His work on <em>Best American Humorous Short Stories</em> was
not part of his regular responsibilities, and he received a $250 advance
against royalties of 3 cents a copy (Cerf to Linscott, 19 January 1945).
Jessup’s anthology had an average sale of 1,500–2,000 copies a year
before the Second World War. Linscott expected the revised edition to
sell over 5,000 copies in the first year and then gradually decline to
the same level as the earlier anthology. He predicted a total sale of
20,000–30,000 copies before it needed to be revised again (Linscott to
R. Hawley Traux, <em>New Yorker</em>, 1 March 1945).</p>
<p><em>Best American Humorous Short Stories</em> sold 3,643 copies during the
12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the
second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

His work on *Best American Humorous Short Stories* was\nnot part of his regular responsibilities, and he received a $250 advance\nagainst royalties of 3 cents a copy (Cerf to Linscott, 19 January 1945).\nJessup’s anthology had an average sale of 1,500–2,000 copies a year\nbefore the Second World War. Linscott expected the revised edition to\nsell over 5,000 copies in the first year and then gradually decline to\nthe same level as the earlier anthology. He predicted a total sale of\n20,000–30,000 copies before it needed to be revised again (Linscott to\nR. Hawley Traux, *New Yorker*, 1 March 1945).\n\n*Best American Humorous Short Stories* sold 3,643 copies during the\n12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles.",
