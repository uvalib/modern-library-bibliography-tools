<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> In response to many urgent requests, the editors of the Modern Library add Izaak Walton’s classic to the series. The great work of the immortal fisherman is given a handsome format in an edition that is well within the purse of the humblest Walton devotee. All the quaint humor and serene wisdom, the lyric moods and the enormous fund of information on the fisherman’s art are here, complete and unabridged. <em>The Compleat Angler</em> is a book to be treasured by readers of every age. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1939. <em>WR</em> 8 April 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1958.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Keynes’s “Life of Izaak Walton” is reprinted from the Nonesuch Press edition of Walton’s complete works (<em>The Compleat Angler, The Lives of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, Herbert &amp; Sanderson, with Love and Truth &amp; Miscellaneous Writings</em>), published in 1929 in 1100 copies, 500 of which were distributed in the U.S. by Random House. The ML edition includes none of the illustrations from the Nonesuch Press edition, but both 319a and 319b retain Keynes’s reference to “the portrait by Jacob Huysman, from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved” (p. 12); a footnote indicates that the portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The revised “Life of Izaak Walton” in 319c omits the words, “from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved.” Keynes also refers to a pastel portrait of Walton by Edmund Ashfield. A footnote in 319a and 319b states, “Now in the possession of Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York”; the footnote in 319c reads, “Formerly in the possession of the late Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York” (p. 12).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 2,617 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing <em>The Compleat Angler</em> in the fourth quarter of ML titles during that 18-month period. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br> All the quaint humor and serene philosophy, the lyrical moods and the enormous fund of information on the angler’s art are here, complete and unabridged, for the devotees of the rod and hook and line, and for all other civilized readers. <em>The Compleat Angler</em>, now three hundred years young, is still the fisherman’s guide and companion; it has been through three centuries a source of joy and wisdom to contemplative men. Izaak Walton’s classic is a book to be treasured by readers of every age and inclination—fishermen and nonfishermen. It is the compleat balm for troubled minds and a refuge of quiet in a noisy world. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keynes’s “The Life of Izaak Walton” (pp. 3–13) was revised and reset in 1948. The printing with the spring 1949 jacket is probably the first from the reset plates. The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s mother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed Keynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton, survived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of Stafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A footnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter from Arthur M. Coon of Cornell University in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> (25 December 1937).</p>
<p>The fall 1952 printing of the jacket was the last in three colors. The fall 1954 jacket in two colors (black and strong green) may have been a response to rising costs of color printing or declining sales of <em>The</em> <em>Compleat Angler</em>. The ML edition of <em>The Compleat Angler</em> was discontinued at the end of 1957.</p>

(168 x 110 mm) with Kent endpaper in orange.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in strong brown (55), brilliant greenish blue (168), and black on linen-finish cream paper depicting a fisherman seated by a stream with trees overhead and a stone bridge and church steeple in the background, all in strong brown with highlights of greenish blue on the river; “COMPLEAT ANGLER” in decorated capitals highlighted in brilliant greenish blue, other lettering in black or brilliant greenish blue. Signed: Galdone, with signature running vertically at right of the riverbank.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> In response to many urgent requests, the editors of the Modern Library add Izaak Walton’s classic to the series. The great work of the immortal fisherman is given a handsome format in an edition that is well within the purse of the humblest Walton devotee. All the quaint humor and serene wisdom, the lyric moods and the enormous fund of information on the fisherman’s art are here, complete and unabridged. *The Compleat Angler* is a book to be treasured by readers of every age. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1939. *WR* 8 April 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1958.  \n\nGeoffrey Keynes’s “Life of Izaak Walton” is reprinted from the Nonesuch Press edition of Walton’s complete works (*The Compleat Angler, The Lives of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, Herbert & Sanderson, with Love and Truth & Miscellaneous Writings*), published in 1929 in 1100 copies, 500 of which were distributed in the U.S. by Random House. The ML edition includes none of the illustrations from the Nonesuch Press edition, but both 319a and 319b retain Keynes’s reference to “the portrait by Jacob Huysman, from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved” (p. 12); a footnote indicates that the portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The revised “Life of Izaak Walton” in 319c omits the words, “from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved.” Keynes also refers to a pastel portrait of Walton by Edmund Ashfield. A footnote in 319a and 319b states, “Now in the possession of Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York”; the footnote in 319c reads, “Formerly in the possession of the late Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York” (p. 12).  \n\nThe ML edition sold 2,617 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing *The Compleat Angler* in the fourth quarter of ML titles during that 18-month period. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 319b.

The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s mother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed Keynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton, survived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of Stafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A footnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter from Arthur M.

The great work of the immortal fisherman is given a handsome format in an edition that is well within the purse of the humblest Walton devotee. All the quaint humor and serene wisdom, the lyric moods and the enormous fund of information on the fisherman’s art are here, complete and unabridged. *The Compleat Angler* is a book to be treasured by readers of every age. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1939. *WR* 8 April 1939. First printing: Not ascertained.
