<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>The Enormous Room</em> is a book of immense proportions. Only in a narrow
sense is it an indictment of war. The filth and the futility of war
are pitilessly revealed, but even more is it a revelation of the
debasement and glory of youth. Written with a fiery imagination and
the keenest sensitiveness, it is none the less a book of the most
spontaneous realism, and as such holds through the years a place by
itself among the few important books produced by the World War. (<em>Fall
1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1922. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Published January 1934. <em>WR</em> 27
January 1934. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.</p>
<p>Cerf rejected <em>The Enormous Room</em> when Cummings’s agent suggested a ML
edition in 1928: “I never considered E. E. Cumming’s [<em>sic</em>] ‘Enormous
Room’ because, in my opinion, it is one of the most over-rated books of
our time” (Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt &amp; Brandt, to Cerf, 18 April 1928;
Cerf to Baumgarten, 21 April 1928). He later changed his mind.</p>
<p>Cummings’s bibliographer wrote in 1960: “Cummings’ ‘Introduction’, his
father’s ‘Foreword’ and the restoration, under the direct supervision of
the author, of the original manuscript text makes the ‘Modern Library’
edition . . . the most authoritative edition issued to date” (Firmage,
p. 5).</p>
<p><em>The Enormous Room</em> sold 2,749 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
Among the few important novels which have survived since the end of
World War One, <em>The Enormous Room</em> still holds a distinguished place
in American fiction. Although it reveals the filth and futility of war
pitilessly, it is not essentially a war novel; it is, rather, an
affirmation of the aspirations and an interpretation of the thwartings
of young men confronted by the fierce reality of battle, the taut
periods of preparation for conflict and the grim aftermath of trial by
fire. Written with imagination and sensibility, <em>The Enormous Room</em> is
a novel spontaneous in realism and rewarding in insights into the
enduring spirit of youth. (<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>

Signed:\nBrienza.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> *The Enormous Room* is a book of immense proportions. Only in a narrow\n> sense is it an indictment of war. The filth and the futility of war\n> are pitilessly revealed, but even more is it a revelation of the\n> debasement and glory of youth. Written with a fiery imagination and\n> the keenest sensitiveness, it is none the less a book of the most\n> spontaneous realism, and as such holds through the years a place by\n> itself among the few important books produced by the World War. (*Fall\n> 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Published January 1934. *WR* 27\nJanuary 1934. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.\n\nCerf rejected *The Enormous Room* when Cummings’s agent suggested a ML\nedition in 1928: “I never considered E. E. Cumming’s \\[*sic*\\] ‘Enormous\nRoom’ because, in my opinion, it is one of the most over-rated books of\nour time” (Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, to Cerf, 18 April 1928;\nCerf to Baumgarten, 21 April 1928). He later changed his mind.\n\nCummings’s bibliographer wrote in 1960: “Cummings’ ‘Introduction’, his\nfather’s ‘Foreword’ and the restoration, under the direct supervision of\nthe author, of the original manuscript text makes the ‘Modern Library’\nedition . . . the most authoritative edition issued to date” (Firmage,\np. 5).\n\n*The Enormous Room* sold 2,749 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 265b.
