<p>Statement on p. [iv]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text followed in this abridgement is that edited by George
Birkbeck Hill, revised and enlarged by L. F. Powell, in six volumes,
published by the Oxford University Press from 1934 to 1950. A few
changes in punctuation have been made to meet the exigencies of
abridgment.</p>
<p>The Powell-Hill <em>Johnson</em> is one of the monuments of scholarship,
probably <em>the</em> great edition of any English classic. The reader who
wishes to read the entire <em>Life of Johnson</em> is, of course, referred to
this edition. We are grateful to the Oxford University Press for their
gracious permission to use the Powell-Hill text in this abridgment.
[<em>The Life of Samuel Johnson</em> comprises vols. 1–4 of the Powell-Hill
edition; vols. 5–6 are Boswell’s <em>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</em>
and Johnson’s <em>Diary of a Journey into North Wales</em>.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial on coated white paper with multi-color illustration
of a London street scene with Samuel Johnson engaged in conversation at

panel at top. Signed: F. K. [Fritz Kredel].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few men in history have ever been known as intimately as Samuel
Johnson. Famous in his own time for his wit and wisdom, he has had the
rare good fortune to gain a posthumous extension of personality and
influence over a period of more than one hundred and sixty years.
James Boswell’s boast that Johnson would “be seen in this work more
completely than any man who has ever yet lived” has been borne out in
the greatest biography in the English language. To give the modern
reader the spirit and substance of Johnson’s life and times, Bergen
Evans, Professor of English at Northwestern University, has winnowed
out the obscurities and irrelevances of the full text and kept its
essence. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML abridgment. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published 25 May 1952. <em>WR</em> 7 June 1952. First printing: Not
ascertained. Also published in MLCE. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in
MLCE.</p>
<p>The ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge
Boswell’s <em>Life of Samuel Johnson</em>. Pottle indicated that he was badly
behind schedule with Boswell’s <em>Journal</em> for McGraw-Hill and added, “I
have no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’s <em>Life of
Johnson</em>. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that
to abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will
buy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is
that the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is,
that they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of
Boswell’s <em>Life of Johnson</em> will continue to be for textbook use in
schools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the
best offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text <u>with a good
index</u>” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951;
underlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition of
<em>The Life of Samuel Johnson</em> (G2) which lacked an index.</p>
<p>Stein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was
Bergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’s <em>Tristam
Shandy</em> in MLCE (1950) and was the author of <em>The Natural History of
Nonsense</em> (1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis
Kronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein
memo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in
the project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on
Johnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography, <em>Samuel Johnson</em> (Henry Holt,
1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have
written and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29
June 1951).</p>
<p>Stein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words.
“There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and
there is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment
of Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein
to Evans, 10 July 1951).</p>
<p>Evans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’s <em>Life of Samuel
Johnson</em> (G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the
first 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal
number of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is
notoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the
errors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from
Malone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from
the definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized
its use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to
about half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The
permission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.</p>
<p>Evans told Stein in a long letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m <u>enthusiastic</u> about this project. I have cut the book down
to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious
significance and without having to make any changes whatever except,
perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for
commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that
no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read
this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to
tell you what had been omitted.</p>
<p>What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but
most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing
Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and
no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of
Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal
comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly
unknown to the common reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts,
then hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing
of her own &amp; has a good, philosophic mind &amp; a sense of style but no
particular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go
through the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to
cut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I
let the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson
canon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had
cut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its
interest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from
over 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text
again, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000,
I believe, nothing <u>whatever</u> of any value or significance . . .
was taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it
with a nail file &amp; took out parenthetical interjections that were
irrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either
the sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and
sections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves
uninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some
unimportant person.”</p>
<p>He concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything
like it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . <u>No</u> solid
thought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly
readable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it
might have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951;
underlining in original).”</p>
<p>Evans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952.
Proofreading was done at Random House.</p>

To give the modern\n> reader the spirit and substance of Johnson’s life and times, Bergen\n> Evans, Professor of English at Northwestern University, has winnowed\n> out the obscurities and irrelevances of the full text and kept its\n> essence. (*Fall 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML abridgment. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting.\nPublished 25 May 1952. *WR* 7 June 1952. First printing: Not\nascertained. Also published in MLCE. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in\nMLCE.\n\nThe ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge\nBoswell’s *Life of Samuel Johnson*. Pottle indicated that he was badly\nbehind schedule with Boswell’s *Journal* for McGraw-Hill and added, “I\nhave no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’s *Life of\nJohnson*. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that\nto abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will\nbuy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is\nthat the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is,\nthat they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of\nBoswell’s *Life of Johnson* will continue to be for textbook use in\nschools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the\nbest offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text <u>with a good\nindex</u>” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951;\nunderlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition of\n*The Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2) which lacked an index.\n\nStein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was\nBergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’s *Tristam\nShandy* in MLCE (1950) and was the author of *The Natural History of\nNonsense* (1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis\nKronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein\nmemo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in\nthe project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on\nJohnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography, *Samuel Johnson* (Henry Holt,\n1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have\nwritten and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29\nJune 1951).\n\nStein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words.\n“There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and\nthere is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment\nof Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein\nto Evans, 10 July 1951).\n\nEvans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’s *Life of Samuel\nJohnson* (G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the\nfirst 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal\nnumber of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is\nnotoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the\nerrors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from\nMalone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from\nthe definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized\nits use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to\nabout half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The\npermission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.\n\nEvans told Stein in a long letter:\n\n> I’m <u>enthusiastic</u> about this project. I have cut the book down\n> to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious\n> significance and without having to make any changes whatever except,\n> perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for\n> commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that\n> no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read\n> this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to\n> tell you what had been omitted.\n>\n> What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but\n> most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing\n> Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and\n> no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of\n> Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal\n> comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly\n> unknown to the common reader.\n\nEvans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts,\nthen hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing\nof her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no\nparticular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go\nthrough the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to\ncut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I\nlet the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson\ncanon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had\ncut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its\ninterest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from\nover 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text\nagain, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000,\nI believe, nothing <u>whatever</u> of any value or significance . . .\nwas taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it\nwith a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were\nirrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either\nthe sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and\nsections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves\nuninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some\nunimportant person.”\n\nHe concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything\nlike it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . <u>No</u> solid\nthought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly\nreadable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it\nmight have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951;\nunderlining in original).”\n\nEvans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952.\nProofreading was done at Random House.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (Giant, 1931) G2\n\nJohnson, *Johnson’s Dictionary: A Modern Selection* (1965) 572\n\nJohnson, *Johnson Reader* (1966) 580\n\n***Fall***",
