<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>No writer of our time has so vividly dramatized the living spirit of
revolution, nor so completely identified himself with the struggle for
a new social order as André Malraux. <em>Man’s Fate</em>, dealing with the
1925–1927 uprising in China, is, indeed, more than a novel of the
fierce conflicts that tore a vast country asunder; it is a revelation
of man’s courage and heroism in the face of imminent annihilation.
Winner of the Goncourt Prize for 1933, <em>Man’s Fate</em> established André
Malraux as one of the leading novelists of France and the world.
(<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chevalier translation originally published by Harrison Smith and Robert
Haas, 1934, two years before Random House acquired the firm. ML edition
(294a, pp. [<em>7</em>]–360) printed from offset plates photographically
reduced from the Smith and Haas edition with page numerals “v–vi”
removed from contents pages; 294b–c (pp. v–360) printed letterpress from
Smith and Haas/RH plates; 294d printed from offset plates
photographically reduced from the Smith and Haas edition. Published
September 1936. <em>WR</em> 26 September 1936. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1973/74. Published in Vintage Books, February 1969.</p>
<p><em>Man’s Fate</em> was the first Smith and Haas title added to the ML after
Cerf and Klopfer absorbed the firm in April 1936.</p>
<p>The Smith and Haas edition measured 8⅜ x 5¾ inches with a type page of
6⅜ by 3⅝ inches. The plates were far too large for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch
format. To include <em>Man’s Fate</em> in the series the ML would either have
to reset the text and make new letterpress plates or photograph a clean
copy of the Smith and Haas edition, reduce the type page
photographically, and print by offset lithography. The quality of offset
lithographic printing in the 1930s was inferior to letterpress and the
cost of each print run was higher, but photographing an existing book
was significantly cheaper than making a new typesetting. There were at
least two printings of 294a from offset plates, including a September
1939 printing of 3,000 copies.</p>
<p>The introduction of the larger ML format in fall 1939 made it possible,
with uncomfortably narrow margins, to use the original letterpress
plates for subsequent ML printings (294b–c). With a top margin that
averaged about ¼ in. (6 mm), letterpress printings in the 1940s, 1950s,
and early 1960s were not examples of fine bookmaking. The ML reverted to
offset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing
dropped below that of letterpress. <em>Man’s Fate</em> is the only ML title to
have been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress,
and again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are
photographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making
printings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of
comfortable margins and freshness of the type.</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or
to Gallimard, the French publisher of <em>La Condition humaine</em>.</p>
<p><em>Man’s Fate</em> sold 3,376 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. <em>Man’s Hope</em> (G56), Malraux’s other novel in the ML, sold 2,143
copies during the same period. <em>Man’s Fate</em> did not rank among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Chevalier’s introduction was written for the Smith and Haas edition. Its
rhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the
1950s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary
impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks,
no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is
burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading,
working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand
channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more
vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .</p>
<p>There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty
of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of
history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being
threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the
moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify
himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to
clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3)</p>
<p>Those of us who demand this can now point to <em>Man’s Fate</em> and say:
‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer
hearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it
was made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the
hearings.</p>

Published in Vintage Books, February 1969.\n\n*Man’s Fate* was the first Smith and Haas title added to the ML after\nCerf and Klopfer absorbed the firm in April 1936.\n\nThe Smith and Haas edition measured 8⅜ x 5¾ inches with a type page of\n6⅜ by 3⅝ inches. The plates were far too large for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch\nformat. To include *Man’s Fate* in the series the ML would either have\nto reset the text and make new letterpress plates or photograph a clean\ncopy of the Smith and Haas edition, reduce the type page\nphotographically, and print by offset lithography. The quality of offset\nlithographic printing in the 1930s was inferior to letterpress and the\ncost of each print run was higher, but photographing an existing book\nwas significantly cheaper than making a new typesetting. There were at\nleast two printings of 294a from offset plates, including a September\n1939 printing of 3,000 copies.\n\nThe introduction of the larger ML format in fall 1939 made it possible,\nwith uncomfortably narrow margins, to use the original letterpress\nplates for subsequent ML printings (294b–c). With a top margin that\naveraged about ¼ in. (6 mm), letterpress printings in the 1940s, 1950s,\nand early 1960s were not examples of fine bookmaking. The ML reverted to\noffset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing\ndropped below that of letterpress. *Man’s Fate* is the only ML title to\nhave been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress,\nand again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are\nphotographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making\nprintings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of\ncomfortable margins and freshness of the type.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or\nto Gallimard, the French publisher of *La Condition humaine*.\n\n*Man’s Fate* sold 3,376 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Man’s Hope* (G56), Malraux’s other novel in the ML, sold 2,143\ncopies during the same period. *Man’s Fate* did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 294b.

(*Fall 1960*)\n\nChevalier’s introduction was written for the Smith and Haas edition. Its\nrhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the\n1950s:\n\n> In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary\n> impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks,\n> no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is\n> burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading,\n> working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand\n> channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more\n> vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .\n>\n> There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty\n> of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of\n> history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being\n> threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the\n> moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify\n> himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to\n> clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3)\n>\n> Those of us who demand this can now point to *Man’s Fate* and say:\n> ‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).\n\nChevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer\nhearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it\nwas made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the\nhearings.\n\n#### 294d.

The ML reverted to\noffset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing\ndropped below that of letterpress. *Man’s Fate* is the only ML title to\nhave been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress,\nand again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are\nphotographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making\nprintings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of\ncomfortable margins and freshness of the type.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or\nto Gallimard, the French publisher of *La Condition humaine*.\n\n*Man’s Fate* sold 3,376 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Man’s Hope* (G56), Malraux’s other novel in the ML, sold 2,143\ncopies during the same period. *Man’s Fate* did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n"

Its\nrhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the\n1950s:\n\n> In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary\n> impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks,\n> no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is\n> burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading,\n> working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand\n> channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more\n> vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .\n>\n> There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty\n> of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of\n> history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being\n> threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the\n> moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify\n> himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to\n> clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3)\n>\n> Those of us who demand this can now point to *Man’s Fate* and say:\n> ‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).\n\nChevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer\nhearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it\nwas made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the\nhearings.\n\n"
