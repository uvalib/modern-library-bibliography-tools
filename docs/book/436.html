<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the twenty-six years of his life, John Keats achieved permanent
rank among the world’s greatest lyricists. His poetry, here offered in
its entirety, includes a number of recently found verses hitherto
unavailable in most collections. In addition, a generous
representation of his letters in complete form throws light on the
emotional life of the poet and the creative sources of his writing.
Harold E. Briggs, Professor of English at the University of Southern
California, contributes an illuminating introduction and provides an
appendix of documents dealing with the damning of “Endymion” by the
critics who were responsible for the crucial series of events at the
end of Keats’s life. (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection, printed from offset plates. Published spring
1951. <em>WR</em> 9 June 1951. First ML printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Published spring 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. Briggs received a flat
fee of $250 to prepare a Keats collection for MLCE (Stein to Briggs, 28
June 1950). In June 1951 Stein indicated that a decision had been made
to include the volume in the regular ML as well. “When the contract was
originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition . . . we
could not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of
knowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to
bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy
of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern
Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve a part of our investment”
(Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1951). Stein sent Briggs an additional payment
of $100 in recognition of the publication of <em>The Complete Poetry and
Selected Prose of John Keats</em> in the regular ML.</p>
<p>The volume was printed from offset plates at a time when most ML titles
were printed letterpress. Freiman was disappointed with the quality of
the printing. When the first set of MLCE sheets arrived he told the ML’s
printer that the quality was “very bad. I would not feel so sad about
this were it not for the fact that these are printed from a new set of
plates. Further, I have been impressed with the fine quality of printing
the Rinehart editions enjoy” (Freiman to Richard Simon, Parkway
Printing, 10 May 1951). MLCE had been created to compete with Rinehart
Editions in the burgeoning college market.</p>
<p>The text of the poems “is substantially that of the first editions. A
number of emendations have been made as a result of collating later
editions. . . . Some silent changes in punctuation, etc., have been made
in the interest of greater clarity. The text of Keats’s letters . . . is
reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press from Maurice Buxton
Forman’s <em>The Letters of John Keats</em>” (p. xxxv).</p>
