<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
By insistent popular demand, Elliot Paul’s masterpiece, <em>The Life and
Death of a Spanish Town</em>, is added to the Modern Library series. The
first book to interpret to Americans the struggle of a people whose
idyllic life was shattered by Fascist terror, it foreshadowed, with
burning indignation against aggressors and outspoken sympathy for the
obscure and simple men and women of Santa Eulalia, the alignment of
forces all over the world today. Elliot Paul’s reputation rests
securely on this book and his more recent national best-seller, <em>The
Last Time I Saw Paris</em>. (<em>Fall 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1954.</p>
<p><em>The Life and Death of a Spanish Town</em> was originally announced as a
spring 1943 title with a publication date of 3 February but was moved
forward to fall 1942. The copyright date for the Author’s Foreword, the
<em>First</em> statement, and the ML lists in the first printing indicate that
the ML edition was printed in fall 1942. Fall 1942 publication is
confirmed by the entry for the ML edition in “The Weekly Record” of
newly published books in the October 31 issue of <em>Publishers’ Weekly</em>.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 10,049 copies by 1 November 1943.</p>

The\n> first book to interpret to Americans the struggle of a people whose\n> idyllic life was shattered by Fascist terror, it foreshadowed, with\n> burning indignation against aggressors and outspoken sympathy for the\n> obscure and simple men and women of Santa Eulalia, the alignment of\n> forces all over the world today. Elliot Paul’s reputation rests\n> securely on this book and his more recent national best-seller, *The\n> Last Time I Saw Paris*. (*Fall 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1937.
