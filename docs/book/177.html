<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
From the time Honoré de Balzac pronounced Stendhal’s preeminence among
the novelists of France until today, the author of <em>The Red and the
Black</em> has retained and spread his influence among writers of every
nationality. His story of Julien Sorel is incomparably the most astute
and penetrating study of middle-class mores in all fiction. It is, in
addition, a relentless dissection of the hypocrisy and opportunism of
as unconscionable an upstart as ever violated the Seventh and other
Commandments in order to get on in the world. (<em>Spring 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes
by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1926. ML edition (pp. v–[288]; v–[352]) printed
from B&amp;L plates. Published June 1929. <em>WR</em> 13 July 1929. First printing:
4,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissue format, 1984.</p>
<p>The ML hyphenates the translator’s name as Scott-Moncrieff on the 177a
title page and omits the hyphen in 177b‑e. Boni &amp; Liveright was also
inconsistent in its multi-volume <em>Works of Stendhal</em>, hyphenating the
translator’s name on the title page of <em>The Red and the Black</em> and
omitting the hyphen on the title page of <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> and
the jackets of both works.</p>
<p>The ML paid Liveright royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Red and the Black</em> ranked high in the fourth quarter of ML titles
in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It
rose to the first quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952. The dramatic increase in sales may reflect
use of <em>The Red and the Black</em> in college literature courses after the
Second World War, when enrollments increased dramatically as large
numbers of veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill to earn college
degrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“True passion,” Stendhal wrote, “never thinks of anything but itself.”
Based on an actual incident that Stendhal read about in the <em>Gazette
des Tribunaux</em> in 1827, <em>The Red and the Black</em> is a brilliant
psychological portrait of passion, opportunism and political intrigue
set in 19th-century Restoration France. It is the story of Julien
Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose
prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless
egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the
calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent
Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are
intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The
contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict
between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp
in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois
mores and French society, <em>The Red and the Black</em> established Stendhal
as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.</p>

It is the story of Julien\n> Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose\n> prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless\n> egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the\n> calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent\n> Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are\n> intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The\n> contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict\n> between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp\n> in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois\n> mores and French society, *The Red and the Black* established Stendhal\n> as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.\n\nPublished fall 1984 at $9.95.

Published June 1929. *WR* 13 July 1929. First printing:\n4,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissue format, 1984.\n\nThe ML hyphenates the translator’s name as Scott-Moncrieff on the 177a\ntitle page and omits the hyphen in 177b‑e. Boni & Liveright was also\ninconsistent in its multi-volume *Works of Stendhal*, hyphenating the\ntranslator’s name on the title page of *The Red and the Black* and\nomitting the hyphen on the title page of *The Charterhouse of Parma* and\nthe jackets of both works.\n\nThe ML paid Liveright royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\n*The Red and the Black* ranked high in the fourth quarter of ML titles\nin terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It\nrose to the first quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952. The dramatic increase in sales may reflect\nuse of *The Red and the Black* in college literature courses after the\nSecond World War, when enrollments increased dramatically as large\nnumbers of veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill to earn college\ndegrees.\n\n"

It is the story of Julien\n> Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose\n> prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless\n> egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the\n> calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent\n> Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are\n> intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The\n> contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict\n> between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp\n> in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois\n> mores and French society, *The Red and the Black* established Stendhal\n> as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.\n\nPublished fall 1984 at $9.95.
