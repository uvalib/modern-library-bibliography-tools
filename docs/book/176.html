<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in deep red (13) and black on cream paper with profile drawing of a young Roman gazing at a bunch of grapes with an expression of satiated dissolution; borders in deep red, lettering in black. Signed: Robert Ball. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> “By his dissolute life he had become as famous as other men by a life of energy, and he was regarded as no ordinary profligate, but as an accomplished voluptuary. . . . He became one of the chosen circle of Nero’s intimates, and was looked upon as an absolute authority on questions of taste in connection with the science of luxurious living.” This estimate of Petronius Arbiter by Tacitus completely characterizes the author of <em>The Satyricon</em> as the cultivated and depraved apotheosis of his uninhibited age. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abbey Classics edition with Scott Moncrieff introduction originally published in U.S. by Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1923, using sheets of the English edition. ML edition (pp. v–238) follows the text of the Abbey Classics edition with the substitution of modern typesetting conventions for Burnaby’s 17th-century practice of capitalizing nouns within sentences. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for May 1929. <em>WR</em> 13 July 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.</p>
<p><em>The Satyricon</em> was written during the reign of Nero. The Burnaby translation, originally published in 1694, was the first in English. Burnaby included supplements to the text, later shown to be spurious, that had been “discovered” in 1688. The first page of the ML text is headed: THE SATYRICON | OF PETRONIUS | <em>THE SATYR OF</em> | <em>TITUS PETRONIUS ARBITER</em> | <em>With its Fragments, recover’d at Buda, 1688</em>. (p. 1).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 2,015 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it one of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles. It did not rank among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952</p>
