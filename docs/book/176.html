<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“By his dissolute life he had become as famous as other men by a life
of energy, and he was regarded as no ordinary profligate, but as an
accomplished voluptuary. . . . He became one of the chosen circle of
Nero’s intimates, and was looked upon as an absolute authority on
questions of taste in connection with the science of luxurious
living.” This estimate of Petronius Arbiter by Tacitus completely
characterizes the author of <em>The Satyricon</em> as the cultivated and
depraved apotheosis of his uninhibited age. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abbey Classics edition with Scott Moncrieff introduction originally
published in U.S. by Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1923, using sheets of the
English edition. ML edition (pp. v–238) follows the text of the Abbey
Classics edition with the substitution of modern typesetting conventions
for Burnaby’s 17th-century practice of capitalizing nouns within
sentences. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for May 1929. <em>WR</em> 13 July 1929. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.</p>
<p><em>The Satyricon</em> was written during the reign of Nero. The Burnaby
translation, originally published in 1694, was the first in English.
Burnaby included supplements to the text, later shown to be spurious,
that had been “discovered” in 1688. The first page of the ML text is
headed: THE SATYRICON | OF PETRONIUS | <em>THE SATYR OF</em> | <em>TITUS PETRONIUS
ARBITER</em> | <em>With its Fragments, recover’d at Buda, 1688</em>. (p. 1).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 2,015 copies during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943, making it one of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles.
It did not rank among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952</p>
