<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>The fame of E. M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em> grows with the
passage of time. When it first appeared, in 1924, critics everywhere
acclaimed it as a brilliant novel which upheld the highest traditions
of English fiction. In the intervening fifteen years, it has
established itself with the general public as a twentieth-century
classic. Its subtle characterizations, its deep understanding of the
Eastern mind, and its serene spirit make it a story to be cherished by
a world from which all tranquillity seems to have departed. (<em>Spring
1940; Spring 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial on coated cream paper with multi-color
illustration of two people on an elephant with Hindus and Moslems in
foreground; background in moderate yellow (87) with author’s name in
black at top and title in reverse on inset rectangular panel in dark
gray (266). Backstrip in dark gray with inset cream panel with title in
black; other lettering and torchbearer in reverse. Signed: Galdone.
Front flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1924. ML edition
(pp. [5]–322) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published April
1940. <em>WR</em> 6 April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1
January 1949.</p>
<p>Cerf tried to include <em>A Passage to India</em> in the ML shortly after he
and Klopfer acquired the series (Cerf to Alfred Harcourt, 10 March
1926). Harcourt, Brace was agreeable but decided to ask Forster’s
permission. Nine months later Harcourt reported, “The upshot of our
correspondence with him is that we are forced to the decision not to
sell this book to The Modern Library for next year” (Harcourt, Brace to
Cerf, 11 December 1926). <em>A Passage to India</em> did not appear in the ML
until thirteen years later.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Second World War, Harcourt, Brace launched its own
hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the
burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it
was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for <em>A Passage to India</em> and
eight other titles, including works by Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne
Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,
Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 3,300 copies of <em>A
Passage to India</em> in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight
months for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June
1948). <em>A Passage to India</em> sold 6,654 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and
Giant titles. Total ML sales were 48,110 copies (B. J. Kirkpatrick,
<em>E. M. Forster</em>, p. 34).</p>

When it first appeared, in 1924, critics everywhere\n> acclaimed it as a brilliant novel which upheld the highest traditions\n> of English fiction. In the intervening fifteen years, it has\n> established itself with the general public as a twentieth-century\n> classic. Its subtle characterizations, its deep understanding of the\n> Eastern mind, and its serene spirit make it a story to be cherished by\n> a world from which all tranquillity seems to have departed. (*Spring\n> 1940; Spring 1944*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial on coated cream paper with multi-color\nillustration of two people on an elephant with Hindus and Moslems in\nforeground; background in moderate yellow (87) with author’s name in\nblack at top and title in reverse on inset rectangular panel in dark\ngray (266). Backstrip in dark gray with inset cream panel with title in\nblack; other lettering and torchbearer in reverse. Signed: Galdone.\nFront flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1946*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1924. ML edition\n(pp. \\[5\\]–322) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published April\n1940. *WR* 6 April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1949.\n\nCerf tried to include *A Passage to India* in the ML shortly after he\nand Klopfer acquired the series (Cerf to Alfred Harcourt, 10 March\n1926). Harcourt, Brace was agreeable but decided to ask Forster’s\npermission. Nine months later Harcourt reported, “The upshot of our\ncorrespondence with him is that we are forced to the decision not to\nsell this book to The Modern Library for next year” (Harcourt, Brace to\nCerf, 11 December 1926). *A Passage to India* did not appear in the ML\nuntil thirteen years later.\n\nShortly after the Second World War, Harcourt, Brace launched its own\nhardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the\nburgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it\nwas terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *A Passage to India* and\neight other titles, including works by Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne\nPorter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,\nBrace, to ML, 18 May 1948).
