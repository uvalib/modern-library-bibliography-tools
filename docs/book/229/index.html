<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The reader who takes up this book for the first time has in store for
him one of the rarest thrills that can be afforded by modern
literature. The editors of the Modern Library unhesitatingly list it
among the greatest novels of all time. That it ranks as one of the
five best sellers in the entire series is a tribute to the taste of
the American public. That the author is now in exile from his native
land is a commentary on the Hitler regime that needs no amplification.
(<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by
Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>]–900) printed from Knopf
plates with table of contents consolidated from vols. 1 and 2, fly title
omitted, and page numeral “xi” removed from the foreword. Published
January 1932. <em>WR</em> 13 February 1932. First printing: 17,000 copies.
Discontinued spring 1938.</p>
<p>Cerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of <em>The Magic Mountain</em> in
1929, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather
than the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have
to be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint
contract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf
did not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the
standard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years
(Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have
not been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12
cents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the
end the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular
printers.</p>
<p>Sales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883
copies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies
(1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).</p>
<p>Knopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year
term. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC
MOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will
be a $3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more
revenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have
the book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada,
18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in
October 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint
contract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a
large final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his
appreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your
attitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot
of things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf
to Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.</p>
<p>Cerf never accepted the loss of <em>The Magic Mountain</em> and tried
repeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical.
In 1942, after Mann’s <em>Buddenbrooks</em> (285) had also been withdrawn from
the ML, Cerf offered a $5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a
copy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you”
for permission to publish <em>The Magic Mountain</em> as a Giant. He added,
“Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know
why this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back
than any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July
1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is
just too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on
any arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the
necessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied:
“I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC
MOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow
<em>Buddenbrooks</em> into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann
title somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent
the best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).</p>
<p><em>The Magic Mountain</em> was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s
acquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML
in 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.</p>

Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\]–900) printed from Knopf\nplates with table of contents consolidated from vols. 1 and 2, fly title\nomitted, and page numeral “xi” removed from the foreword. Published\nJanuary 1932. *WR* 13 February 1932. First printing: 17,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1938.\n\nCerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of *The Magic Mountain* in\n1929, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather\nthan the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have\nto be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint\ncontract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf\ndid not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the\nstandard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years\n(Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have\nnot been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12\ncents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the\nend the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular\nprinters.\n\nSales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883\ncopies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies\n(1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nKnopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year\nterm. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will\nbe a $3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more\nrevenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have\nthe book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada,\n18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in\nOctober 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint\ncontract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a\nlarge final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his\nappreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your\nattitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot\nof things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf\nto Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.\n\nCerf never accepted the loss of *The Magic Mountain* and tried\nrepeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical.\nIn 1942, after Mann’s *Buddenbrooks* (285) had also been withdrawn from\nthe ML, Cerf offered a $5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a\ncopy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you”\nfor permission to publish *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant. He added,\n“Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know\nwhy this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back\nthan any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July\n1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is\njust too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on\nany arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the\nnecessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied:\n“I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow\n*Buddenbrooks* into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann\ntitle somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent\nthe best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).\n\n*The Magic Mountain* was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s\nacquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML\nin 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMann, *Buddenbrooks* (1935–1940) 285\n\nMann, Thomas, *Stories of Three Decades* (Giant, 1961–1973; 1979–1986)\nG97\n\nMann, *Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man* (1965–1971) 577\n\nMann, *Doctor Faustus* (1966– ) 582",
