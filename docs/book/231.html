cane; borders and title in strong red, other lettering in black; adapted
from the Sun Dial Library jacket. (<em>Spring 1932</em>) <em>Note:</em> The 231a
jacket is one of most ML’s most striking jackets of the balloon cloth
era. The image of Dracula is from the Sun Dial Library jacket; the
lettering and brilliant yellow background are original to the ML.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:Mention of any thriller immediately brings a comparison to
<em>Dracula</em>, the model toward which writers of the macabre strive. As a
novel it has provided chills and nightmares for countless readers; on
the stage and as a cinema it has aroused terror in the hearts of vast
audiences. The monstrous figure of Dracula, half human, half bat, the
“human vampire,” is as original and forbidding a creature as the
literature of horror has ever created. His sinister deeds grip you
with an icy fear and hold you spellbound. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, McClure &amp; Co., 1899. ML
edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new
typesetting; the plates appear to have been made for the ML’s exclusive
use. Published February 1932. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1932. First printing: 5,000
copies. Discontinued 1990. <em>Dracula</em> was one of eleven Sun Dial Library
titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday
series in 1930. <em>Dracula</em> had been the Sun Dial Library’s best-selling
title with total sales of 10,953 copies to February 1930.</p>
<p>The plates for <em>Dracula</em>, along with new plates for Maugham’s <em>Of Human
Bondage</em> (199) and Bennett’s <em>Old Wives’ Tale</em> (207), were ready in July
1930 (Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 14 July 1930). The ML paid Doubleday,
Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Klopfer suggested a reduction in the
royalty rate after <em>Dracula</em> entered the public domain but indicated
that the ML would agree to whatever Doubleday decided (Klopfer to Mina
Turner, Doubleday, 17 April 1958). By 1965 the ML was paying royalties
of 5 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Dracula</em> sold 5,052 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

ML\nedition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new\ntypesetting; the plates appear to have been made for the ML’s exclusive\nuse. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First printing: 5,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1990. *Dracula* was one of eleven Sun Dial Library\ntitles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday\nseries in 1930. *Dracula* had been the Sun Dial Library’s best-selling\ntitle with total sales of 10,953 copies to February 1930.\n\nThe plates for *Dracula*, along with new plates for Maugham’s *Of Human\nBondage* (199) and Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale* (207), were ready in July\n1930 (Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 14 July 1930). The ML paid Doubleday,\nDoran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Klopfer suggested a reduction in the\nroyalty rate after *Dracula* entered the public domain but indicated\nthat the ML would agree to whatever Doubleday decided (Klopfer to Mina\nTurner, Doubleday, 17 April 1958). By 1965 the ML was paying royalties\nof 5 cents a copy.\n\n*Dracula* sold 5,052 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n**231b.
