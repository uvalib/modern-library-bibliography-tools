<p><strong>SøREN KIERKEGAARD. A KIERKEGAARD ANTHOLOGY. 1959– . (ML 303)</strong></p>
<h4>518a. First printing (1959)</h4>
<p>A | Kierkegaard | Anthology | <em>Edited by</em> ROBERT BRETALL | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/E5.webp'>torchbearer E5</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK</p>
<p>Pp. [i–vii] viii–xxv [xxvi], [<em>2</em>], [1] 2–482, [<em>2</em>], [483] 484–494 [495–498]. [1–15]<sup>16</sup> [16]<sup>8</sup> [17]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] <em>Copyright</em> © <em>1936, 1940, 1941, 1944, 1946 by Princeton University Press</em> | <em>Copyright, 1943, by Augsburg Publishing House</em> | <em>Copyright, 1938, by Harper and Brothers</em>; [v] dedication; [vi] blank; [vii]–xi PREFACE signed p. xi: ROBERT WALTER BRETALL | Phoenix, Arizona | 27 February 1946; [xii] blank; [xiii]–xv CONTENTS; [xvi] blank; [xvii]–xxv INTRODUCTION; [xxvi] epigraphs from <em>Either/Or</em> and <em>The Journals</em>; [<em>1</em>] fly title; [<em>2</em>] blank; [1]–482 text; [<em>1</em>] part title: <em>BIBLIOGRAPHY</em> | <em>AND</em> | <em>INDEX</em>; [<em>2</em>] blank; [483]–488 BIBLIOGRAPHY; [489]–494 INDEX; [495–496] ML Giants list; [497] American College Dictionary advertisement; [498] blank. (<em>Fall 1959</em>) <em>Note:</em> ML Giants list not updated in subsequent printings.</p>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>A:</em> Pictorial in black, vivid reddish orange (34) and strong greenish blue (169) on coated white paper with portrait of Kierkegaard on inset oval panel in strong greenish blue; lettering in reverse, vivid reddish orange and strong greenish blue, all against black background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> This anthology covers the whole of Kierkegaard’s literary career. The selections range from the terse epigrams of the <em>Journal</em> through the famous “Diary of the Seducer” and the “Banquet” scene, in which S. K. reveals his great lyric and dramatic gifts, on to the philosophical and psychological works of his maturity. These are climaxed by the beautiful and moving religious discourses which accompany them; finally there is the biting satire of his <em>Attack upon</em> “<em>Christendom</em>.”
This is emphatically not a collection of “snippets,” but the cream of Kierkegaard, each selection interesting and intelligible in itself, and all ranking among his most important work. As the <em>New York Herald Tribune</em> commented, Mr. Bretall “has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what such remarks should be.” (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B1:</em> Pictorial in deep orange yellow (72), vivid reddish orange (34) and black on coated white paper with sketch of Kierkegaard at left and lettering in black, vivid reddish orange and deep orange yellow, all against white background; lettering on spine against deep orange yellow background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> First paragraph as 518a except “S. K.” is replaced by “Kierkegaard” and “on to the philosophical and psychological works” is replaced by “and continues with the philosophical and psychological works of his maturity.”
Second paragraph abbreviated with square brackets and ellipsis in original: “[Mr. Bretall] has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what such remarks should be.” —<strong>New York Herald Tribune</strong> (<em>Spring 1967</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Princeton University Press, 1946. ML edition (pp. [v]–[xxvi], [1]–494) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Princeton University Press edition with frontispiece portrait of Kierkegaard omitted and fly title reset. Published fall 1959. <em>WR</em> 5 October 1959. First printing: 15,000 copies.</p>
<p>The ML paid Princeton University Press a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. <em>A Kierkegaard Anthology</em> had sold steadily in its Princeton University Press edition and seems to have done well in the ML. There was an unusually large ML printing of 22,200 copies in 1962.</p>

The selections range from the terse epigrams of the *Journal* through the famous “Diary of the Seducer” and the “Banquet” scene, in which S. K. reveals his great lyric and dramatic gifts, on to the philosophical and psychological works of his maturity. These are climaxed by the beautiful and moving religious discourses which accompany them; finally there is the biting satire of his *Attack upon* “*Christendom*.” \n> This is emphatically not a collection of “snippets,” but the cream of Kierkegaard, each selection interesting and intelligible in itself, and all ranking among his most important work. As the *New York Herald Tribune* commented, Mr. Bretall “has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what such remarks should be.” (*Fall 1959*) \n\n*Jacket B1:* Pictorial in deep orange yellow (72), vivid reddish orange (34) and black on coated white paper with sketch of Kierkegaard at left and lettering in black, vivid reddish orange and deep orange yellow, all against white background; lettering on spine against deep orange yellow background. \n\n> Front flap:<br> First paragraph as 518a except “S. K.” is replaced by “Kierkegaard” and “on to the philosophical and psychological works” is replaced by “and continues with the philosophical and psychological works of his maturity.” \n> Second paragraph abbreviated with square brackets and ellipsis in original: “[Mr. Bretall] has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what such remarks should be.” —**New York Herald Tribune** (*Spring 1967*) \n\nOriginally published by Princeton University Press, 1946.
