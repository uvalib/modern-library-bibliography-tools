<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For several years the editors of the Modern Library have sought to
include a representative yet variegated collection of Franz Kafka’s
short stories in the series. Now, after long negotiations, fifteen of
his best tales, selected and brilliantly introduced by Philip Rahv,
editor of <em>The Partisan Review</em>, are made available to the
ever-expanding circle of Kafka enthusiasts. The newly recognized
master of obsessive fantasy, of symbolic narrative, stark and
compelling in its reality, is represented in this volume by such
memorable stories as “The Metamorphosis,” “The Great Wall of China,”
“The Judgment,” “In the Penal Colony,” “The Hunter Gracchus,” “The
Burrow,” and nine others of equal power and inexorable fascination.
(<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Fujita non-pictorial jacket in vivid reddish orange (34),
vivid yellow (82) and black on coated white paper with inset black
rectangular panel containing title in vivid yellow and vivid reddish
orange and other lettering in reverse; series in black and torchbearer
in vivid yellow below panel, all against white background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No writer in history has illuminated the dark and fantastic side of
the human soul with the clarity and perception of Kafka, and this
group of stories has been selected to reflect his finest and most
representative work.</p>
<p>In his brilliant introduction to this volume, Philip Rahv writes,
“Kafka so compellingly arouses in us a sense of immediate relatedness,
of strong even if uneasy identification . . . because of the profound
quality of his feeling for the experience of human loss, estrangement,
guilt and anxiety—an experience increasingly dominant in the modern
age.” Indeed, Kafka speaks to today’s world with a rarely equaled
immediacy and directness of expression.</p>
<p>These selected stories comprise fifteen of Kafka’s best-known and most
typical works, including “The Metamorphosis,” “In the Penal Colony,”
“The Great Wall of China,” “Investigations of a Dog,” and “The New
Advocate.” <em>Note:</em> Ellipsis in original.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection selected from <em>The Penal</em> <em>Colony</em>, translated by
Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1946) and <em>The Great Wall of
China</em>, translated by Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1948). ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall
1952. <em>WR</em> 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.</p>
<p>The negotiations that resulted in publication of <em>Selected Stories of
Franz Kafka</em> took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’
hopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty
over the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to
plan a collection of thirteen stories selected from <em>The Penal</em> <em>Colony</em>
and <em>The Great Wall of China</em> in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken
Books appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against
royalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the
contract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested
resuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November
1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would
use other translations of the two most important stories and find other
material to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).</p>
<p>Commins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and
reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we
at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by
reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the
ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of
this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.</p>
<p>I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s
stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of
the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,
whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is
valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other
than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.</p>
<p>Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede
with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission
for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s
short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project
unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we
make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.</p>
<p>I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into
the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to
Cerf, 8 December 1949)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins
reported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken
[<em>sic</em>] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.
There are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents
which are not protected. These would require new translation, but there
would not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are
convinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen
negotiations with Shocken [<em>sic</em>]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January
1950).</p>
<p>Kurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported
that Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation
which were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken
proposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make
a selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help
arrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).
Little had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months
later. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of
<em>The Great Wall of China</em> with additional stories, were still
forthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML
selection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken
to Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May
1951).</p>
<p>Cerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the
Kafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could
produce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,
16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952
Random House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus &amp; Young for the
publication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great
Wall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It
is not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &amp;
Young guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random
House’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,
Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point
Schocken capitulated.</p>
<p>The ML edition of <em>Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa</em>, reprinted by
arrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared
three months later.</p>
<p>The ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received
$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been
ascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of
5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two
printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two
printings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These
figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;
some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the
total of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate
within 20,000 copies or so.</p>

ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall\n1952. *WR* 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.\n\nThe negotiations that resulted in publication of *Selected Stories of\nFranz Kafka* took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’\nhopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty\nover the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to\nplan a collection of thirteen stories selected from *The Penal* *Colony*\nand *The Great Wall of China* in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken\nBooks appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the\ncontract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested\nresuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November\n1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would\nuse other translations of the two most important stories and find other\nmaterial to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).\n\nCommins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and\nreported:\n\n> The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we\n> at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by\n> reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the\n> ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of\n> this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.\n>\n> I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s\n> stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of\n> the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,\n> whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is\n> valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other\n> than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.\n>\n> Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede\n> with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission\n> for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s\n> short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project\n> unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we\n> make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.\n>\n> I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into\n> the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to\n> Cerf, 8 December 1949)\n\nAfter analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins\nreported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken\n\\[*sic*\\] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.\nThere are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents\nwhich are not protected. These would require new translation, but there\nwould not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are\nconvinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen\nnegotiations with Shocken \\[*sic*\\]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January\n1950).\n\nKurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported\nthat Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation\nwhich were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken\nproposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make\na selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help\narrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).\nLittle had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months\nlater. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of\n*The Great Wall of China* with additional stories, were still\nforthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML\nselection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken\nto Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May\n1951).\n\nCerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the\nKafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could\nproduce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,\n16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952\nRandom House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the\npublication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great\nWall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It\nis not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &\nYoung guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random\nHouse’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point\nSchocken capitulated.\n\nThe ML edition of *Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa*, reprinted by\narrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared\nthree months later.\n\nThe ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received\n$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been\nascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of\n5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two\nprintings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two\nprintings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These\nfigures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;\nsome records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the\ntotal of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate\nwithin 20,000 copies or so.\n\n#### 453b.

ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall\n1952. *WR* 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.\n\nThe negotiations that resulted in publication of *Selected Stories of\nFranz Kafka* took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’\nhopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty\nover the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to\nplan a collection of thirteen stories selected from *The Penal* *Colony*\nand *The Great Wall of China* in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken\nBooks appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the\ncontract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested\nresuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November\n1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would\nuse other translations of the two most important stories and find other\nmaterial to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).\n\nCommins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and\nreported:\n\n> The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we\n> at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by\n> reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the\n> ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of\n> this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.\n>\n> I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s\n> stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of\n> the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,\n> whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is\n> valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other\n> than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.\n>\n> Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede\n> with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission\n> for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s\n> short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project\n> unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we\n> make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.\n>\n> I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into\n> the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to\n> Cerf, 8 December 1949)\n\nAfter analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins\nreported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken\n\\[*sic*\\] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.\nThere are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents\nwhich are not protected. These would require new translation, but there\nwould not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are\nconvinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen\nnegotiations with Shocken \\[*sic*\\]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January\n1950).\n\nKurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported\nthat Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation\nwhich were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken\nproposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make\na selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help\narrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).\nLittle had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months\nlater. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of\n*The Great Wall of China* with additional stories, were still\nforthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML\nselection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken\nto Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May\n1951).\n\nCerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the\nKafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could\nproduce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,\n16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952\nRandom House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the\npublication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great\nWall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It\nis not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &\nYoung guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random\nHouse’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point\nSchocken capitulated.\n\nThe ML edition of *Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa*, reprinted by\narrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared\nthree months later.\n\nThe ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received\n$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been\nascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of\n5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two\nprintings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two\nprintings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These\nfigures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;\nsome records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the\ntotal of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate\nwithin 20,000 copies or so.\n\n"
