<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Lord Jim</em> is by all odds the most popular novel by Joseph Conrad, as
well as one of the most exciting adventure stories ever written. It is
the story of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity. Conrad
wrote an admirer “I will have no favorites, but I do not feel grieved
that you prefer ‘<em>Lord Jim</em>’ to all my other books. I won’t even say
that ‘I fail to understand’ . . .” (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday &amp; McClure Co., 1900. New
bibliographical edition published in Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co.’s Sun Dial
Library (1928), <em>The Malay Edition of the Works of Joseph Conrad</em>
(1929), and possibly elsewhere. ML edition (pp. [iii], [vii]–417)
printed from Sun Dial Library/Malay Edition plates with decorations in
the Malay Edition omitted from pp. [iii–iv] and [1–2] of ML
printings. Published February 1931. <em>WR</em> 21 March 1931. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.</p>
<p><em>Lord Jim</em> was the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the
ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML
paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p>The Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included
Canadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights
when they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers
when they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the
Macmillan Co. of Canada, sold <em>Lord Jim</em> for five months before
Blackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the
transgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped
selling <em>Lord Jim</em> in Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian
sales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards”
(Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to
Longwell, 4 September 1931).</p>
<p><em>Lord Jim</em> sold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant
titles. Conrad’s <em>Victory</em> (238) sold 7,335 copies during the same
period. Sales of <em>Lord Jim</em> totaled 115,000 copies by 1949. By the early
1950s Conrad was one of the best-selling authors in the ML. <em>Lord Jim</em>
sold 8,669 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952, making it the 11th best-selling title in the regular ML; <em>Victory</em>
was the 15th best-selling title. <em>Nostromo</em> (438), published in November
1951, appears to have lagged behind Conrad’s other titles; it did not
rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML at this period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Perhaps the most popular of all his novels, <em>Lord Jim</em> is undoubtedly
Joseph Conrad’s most exciting adventure story. Its theme of a heroic
man victimized by his own integrity and destroyed by his sense of lost
honor is one of the most appealing in the literature of idealism. All
the powers of a great descriptive artist and a thinker concerned with
courage and devotion and the crises of conscience are lavished upon
this tale of a man who stakes his life on a high principle and loses.
“I will have no favorites,” Conrad wrote to an admirer, “but I do not
feel grieved that you prefer <em>Lord Jim</em> to all my other books.”
(<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>

(*Spring 1931*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> *Lord Jim* is by all odds the most popular novel by Joseph Conrad, as\n> well as one of the most exciting adventure stories ever written. It is\n> the story of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity. Conrad\n> wrote an admirer “I will have no favorites, but I do not feel grieved\n> that you prefer ‘*Lord Jim*’ to all my other books. I won’t even say\n> that ‘I fail to understand’ . . .” (*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday & McClure Co., 1900. New\nbibliographical edition published in Doubleday, Doran & Co.’s Sun Dial\nLibrary (1928), *The Malay Edition of the Works of Joseph Conrad*\n(1929), and possibly elsewhere. ML edition (pp. \\[iii\\], \\[vii\\]–417)\nprinted from Sun Dial Library/Malay Edition plates with decorations in\nthe Malay Edition omitted from pp. \\[iii–iv\\] and \\[1–2\\] of ML\nprintings. Published February 1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.\n\n*Lord Jim* was the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the\nML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML\npaid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\nThe Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included\nCanadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights\nwhen they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers\nwhen they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the\nMacmillan Co. of Canada, sold *Lord Jim* for five months before\nBlackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the\ntransgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped\nselling *Lord Jim* in Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian\nsales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards”\n(Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to\nLongwell, 4 September 1931).\n\n*Lord Jim* sold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant\ntitles. Conrad’s *Victory* (238) sold 7,335 copies during the same\nperiod. Sales of *Lord Jim* totaled 115,000 copies by 1949. By the early\n1950s Conrad was one of the best-selling authors in the ML. *Lord Jim*\nsold 8,669 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952, making it the 11th best-selling title in the regular ML; *Victory*\nwas the 15th best-selling title. *Nostromo* (438), published in November\n1951, appears to have lagged behind Conrad’s other titles; it did not\nrank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML at this period.\n\n#### 210b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nLORD JIM | BY JOSEPH CONRAD | Introduction by <span class=\"smallcaps\">j.\ndonald adams</span> | \\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at\nleft\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPagination and collation as 210a.\n\nContents as 210a except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[ii\\] COPYRIGHT, 1899, 1900, BY\nJOSEPH CONRAD | COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY DOUBLEDAY, DORAN & CO., INC. |\nINTRODUCTION COPYRIGHT, 1931, | BY THE MODERN LIBRARY, INC. *Note:* Fly\ntitle reset.\n\n*Jacket A:* Non-pictorial in grayish blue (186) and dark red (16) on\ncream paper; title and author in dark red on inset cream panel,\nbackground in grayish blue with series and torchbearer in reverse.
