<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>The addition of Chaucer’s <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> in a modern verse
rendering to the Modern Library series is a boon to readers
everywhere. For students in our schools and colleges especially it
provides a scholarly and readable version of what is considered by the
most eminent authorities to be, with <em>The</em> <em>Canterbury Tales</em> (No.
161), Chaucer’s greatest achievement. Originally published under the
Random House imprint in a volume which sold at $3.50, it is now issued
in an entirely new edition at a price within the reach of everybody.
(<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Krapp translation originally published by Random House, 1932, with wood
engravings by Eric Gill on the outer margins of facing pages (verso and
recto) and full page wood engravings at the beginning of each of the
five parts. Trade edition published from a new typesetting that closely
follows that of the 1932 edition, with illustrations omitted and page
numerals shifted from the head of the page at the outer margins to the
foot of the page at the center. The trade edition is ⅜ inch larger than
the ML edition and appears to have been published shortly before or
simultaneously with the ML edition. ML edition (pp. v–309) printed from
plates of the RH trade edition. The only significant differences between
the two printings are the title leaf and half title: the RH half title
is in Trafton script and the ML half title is in roman type. Published
January 1940. <em>WR</em> 27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued fall 1944.</p>
<p>The ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful and was discontinued
after less than five years. In 1957, thirteen years after the ML edition
was discontinued, Random House used the ML plates to publish <em>Troilus
and Cressida</em> in Modern Library Paperbacks, its trade paperback imprint.
After Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960 the Knopf
paperback series, Vintage Books, became Random House’s primary trade
paperback imprint. Subsequent printings of <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>
appeared in Vintage Books.</p>

For students in our schools and colleges especially it\n> provides a scholarly and readable version of what is considered by the\n> most eminent authorities to be, with *The* *Canterbury Tales* (No.\n> 161), Chaucer’s greatest achievement. Originally published under the\n> Random House imprint in a volume which sold at $3.50, it is now issued\n> in an entirely new edition at a price within the reach of everybody.\n> (*Spring 1940*)\n\nKrapp translation originally published by Random House, 1932, with wood\nengravings by Eric Gill on the outer margins of facing pages (verso and\nrecto) and full page wood engravings at the beginning of each of the\nfive parts. Trade edition published from a new typesetting that closely\nfollows that of the 1932 edition, with illustrations omitted and page\nnumerals shifted from the head of the page at the outer margins to the\nfoot of the page at the center. The trade edition is ⅜ inch larger than\nthe ML edition and appears to have been published shortly before or\nsimultaneously with the ML edition. ML edition (pp. v–309) printed from\nplates of the RH trade edition. The only significant differences between\nthe two printings are the title leaf and half title: the RH half title\nis in Trafton script and the ML half title is in roman type. Published\nJanuary 1940. *WR* 27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1944.\n\nThe ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful and was discontinued\nafter less than five years. In 1957, thirteen years after the ML edition\nwas discontinued, Random House used the ML plates to publish *Troilus\nand Cressida* in Modern Library Paperbacks, its trade paperback imprint.\nAfter Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960 the Knopf\npaperback series, Vintage Books, became Random House’s primary trade\npaperback imprint. Subsequent printings of *Troilus and Cressida*\nappeared in Vintage Books.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nChaucer, *Canterbury Tales* (1929–1971) 181",

For students in our schools and colleges especially it\n> provides a scholarly and readable version of what is considered by the\n> most eminent authorities to be, with *The* *Canterbury Tales* (No.\n> 161), Chaucer’s greatest achievement. Originally published under the\n> Random House imprint in a volume which sold at $3.50, it is now issued\n> in an entirely new edition at a price within the reach of everybody.\n> (*Spring 1940*)\n\nKrapp translation originally published by Random House, 1932, with wood\nengravings by Eric Gill on the outer margins of facing pages (verso and\nrecto) and full page wood engravings at the beginning of each of the\nfive parts. Trade edition published from a new typesetting that closely\nfollows that of the 1932 edition, with illustrations omitted and page\nnumerals shifted from the head of the page at the outer margins to the\nfoot of the page at the center. The trade edition is ⅜ inch larger than\nthe ML edition and appears to have been published shortly before or\nsimultaneously with the ML edition. ML edition (pp. v–309) printed from\nplates of the RH trade edition. The only significant differences between\nthe two printings are the title leaf and half title: the RH half title\nis in Trafton script and the ML half title is in roman type. Published\nJanuary 1940. *WR* 27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1944.\n\nThe ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful and was discontinued\nafter less than five years. In 1957, thirteen years after the ML edition\nwas discontinued, Random House used the ML plates to publish *Troilus\nand Cressida* in Modern Library Paperbacks, its trade paperback imprint.\nAfter Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960 the Knopf\npaperback series, Vintage Books, became Random House’s primary trade\npaperback imprint. Subsequent printings of *Troilus and Cressida*\nappeared in Vintage Books.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nChaucer, *Canterbury Tales* (1929–1971) 181"
