ALEXANDRE DUMAS | [rule] | [torchbearer A2] | [rule] | THE MODERN
LIBRARY | PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK</p>
<p>Pp. [<em>4</em>], 1–596. [1–18]<sup>16</sup> [19]<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>[<em>1</em>] half title; [<em>2</em>] pub. note D5; [<em>3</em>] title; [<em>4</em>] <em>First
Modern Library Edition</em> | 1928; 1–596 text.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
The Modern Library offers you herewith a complete and unabridged
“Three Musketeers” in one volume to slip into your coat pocket or tuck
into an accessible corner of your library shelf. For the next time a
fit of boredom or weariness assails you, a dose of d’Artagnan and his
three musketeers—Porthos, Athos, and Aramis—is confidently prescribed.
(<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in vivid red (11) and black on cream paper
depicting four swords held aloft with a plumed hat perched on one of the
swords; lettering in black, borders in vivid red. Signed: Staloff.
(<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
However much the industry of Alexandre Dumas is held up as an example
of literature in its first manifestations of mass production, <em>The
Three Musketeers</em> still throbs with undiminished pulse for the modern
reader. Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos [<em>sic</em>] and
Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan,
there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the
progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in
fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first
and final perfection. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. ML
edition printed from Burt plates. Publication announced for February
1928. <em>WR</em> 26 May 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded
spring 1950 by Le Clercq translation (153.2).</p>
<p>The ML bought a set of plates from Burt. Neither Burt nor the ML knew
the name of the translator or the date of the translation (Doris
Schneider to E. P. Dutton Co., 4 April 1929).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> during the first six months of 1928
placed it 18th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms
of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

For the next time a\n> fit of boredom or weariness assails you, a dose of d’Artagnan and his\n> three musketeers—Porthos, Athos, and Aramis—is confidently prescribed.\n> (*Spring 1928*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D.

Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos \\[*sic*\\] and\n> Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan,\n> there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the\n> progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in\n> fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first\n> and final perfection. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nAnonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. ML\nedition printed from Burt plates. Publication announced for February\n1928. *WR* 26 May 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded\nspring 1950 by Le Clercq translation (153.2).\n\nThe ML bought a set of plates from Burt. Neither Burt nor the ML knew\nthe name of the translator or the date of the translation (Doris\nSchneider to E. P. Dutton Co., 4 April 1929).\n\nSales of *The Three Musketeers* during the first six months of 1928\nplaced it 18th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms\nof sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 153.1b.
