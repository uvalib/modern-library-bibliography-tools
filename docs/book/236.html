<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The wide range of Benjamin Franklin’s interests and activities opened the doors of the world to him. Printer, inventor, philosopher, diplomat, champion of liberty, he made his influence felt not only upon his own time, but upon every American generation. His wise maxims and shrewd observations have become national axioms. His <em>Autobiography</em>, as rich in material as it is engaging in style, is one of those rare documents that reveals both a rich personality and the crucial events that transpired during his lifetime. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published April 1932. <em>WR</em> 7 May 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Cerf originally planned to publish Franklin’s <em>Autobiography</em> by itself. Three months before publication he decided to add more of Franklin’s writings so the book would be a better value. Goodman, who suggested the additional contents, received $100 for his work on the volume.</p>
<p><em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em> and <em>The Poems of Longfellow</em> (235) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and Longfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from this day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press unless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both the typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think that the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to William Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).</p>
<p>The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed pictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first printing are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained in use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive jackets the ML ever used.</p>
<p><em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em> sold 5,569 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,468 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—a decline in real terms compared with the Second World War, when book sales of all kinds were booming, but enough to place it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

Jacket title: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in moderate blue (182) and yellowish gray (93) on coated white paper depicting Franklin taking notes while conducting an experiment; borders and lettering in moderate blue, background in yellowish gray. Signed: WC. Jacket title: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND SELECTIONS FROM HIS OTHER WRITINGS (front panel); SELECTED WRITINGS OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (backstrip). (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The wide range of Benjamin Franklin’s interests and activities opened the doors of the world to him. Printer, inventor, philosopher, diplomat, champion of liberty, he made his influence felt not only upon his own time, but upon every American generation. His wise maxims and shrewd observations have become national axioms. His *Autobiography*, as rich in material as it is engaging in style, is one of those rare documents that reveals both a rich personality and the crucial events that transpired during his lifetime. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nCerf originally planned to publish Franklin’s *Autobiography* by itself. Three months before publication he decided to add more of Franklin’s writings so the book would be a better value. Goodman, who suggested the additional contents, received \\$100 for his work on the volume.  \n\n*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* and *The Poems of Longfellow* (235) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and Longfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from this day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press unless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both the typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think that the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to William Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).  \n\nThe Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed pictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first printing are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained in use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive jackets the ML ever used.  \n\n*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* sold 5,569 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,468 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—a decline in real terms compared with the Second World War, when book sales of all kinds were booming, but enough to place it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.  \n\n#### 236.1b.
