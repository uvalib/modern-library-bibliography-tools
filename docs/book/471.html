<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in strong greenish yellow (99), dark grayish blue

stars; lettering in dark grayish blue and black. Signed: PG [Paul
Galdone].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify
Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our
times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with
startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer
appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The
twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly
understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue
of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but
they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic
material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human
experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and
psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that
experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved. (<em>Fall
1954</em>)</p>

<p><em>A Curtain of Green</em> originally published with Porter introduction by
Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as
<em>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</em> by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1947.
<em>The Wide Net and Other Stories</em> originally published by Harcourt, Brace
&amp; Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from
Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 16 October 1954. First
printing: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt,
Brace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager
sent <em>A Curtain of Green</em>, <em>The Robber Bridegroom</em>, <em>The Wide Net</em>,
<em>Delta Wedding</em>, and <em>The Golden Apples</em>, expressing the hope that the
ML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The
reprint contract for <em>Selected Stories of Eudora Welty</em> was signed a
month later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy.
There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk
reports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (<em>Eudora Welty:
A Bibliography of Her Work</em>, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete
information about printings and sales is not available in the RH
archives, but the following evidence is suggestive: <em>Selected Stories of
Eudora Welty</em> does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than
2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and
it sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500
titles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the
titles that survived.</p>
<p>Textual variants between the first edition of <em>A Curtain of Green</em>
(Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text
of the Modern Library <em>A Curtain of Green</em>” (1979). Polk writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of <em>A
Curtain of Green</em>. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions
or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a
copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss
Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she
responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY:
Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John
Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of <em>A
Curtain of Green</em> is two typesettings removed from the first American
edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in
any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences
between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be
considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted
the Harcourt, Brace text in its <em>Selected Stories</em> (NY, 1954), it of
course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some
importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of <em>A
Curtain of Green</em> is both the only one currently in print and the text
most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the
Harcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in
print and the one most frequently cited.</p>

<p>Polk indicates that the ML edition went out of print in October 1977
after 27,035 copies had been printed and that it was brought back into
print in 1978 (<em>Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work</em>, p. 94). It
appears more likely that it went out of print in 1976 since 471c was
published in fall 1977.</p>

(*Fall\n> 1954*)\n\n*A Curtain of Green* originally published with Porter introduction by\nDoubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as\n*A Curtain of Green and Other Stories* by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947.\n*The Wide Net and Other Stories* originally published by Harcourt, Brace\n& Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from\nHarcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First\nprinting: 5,000 copies.\n\nCerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt,\nBrace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager\nsent *A Curtain of Green*, *The Robber Bridegroom*, *The Wide Net*,\n*Delta Wedding*, and *The Golden Apples*, expressing the hope that the\nML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The\nreprint contract for *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* was signed a\nmonth later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy.\nThere was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk\nreports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (*Eudora Welty:\nA Bibliography of Her Work*, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete\ninformation about printings and sales is not available in the RH\narchives, but the following evidence is suggestive: *Selected Stories of\nEudora Welty* does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than\n2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and\nit sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500\ntitles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the\ntitles that survived.\n\nTextual variants between the first edition of *A Curtain of Green*\n(Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text\nof the Modern Library *A Curtain of Green*” (1979). Polk writes:\n\n> In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of *A\n> Curtain of Green*. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions\n> or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a\n> copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss\n> Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she\n> responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY:\n> Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John\n> Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of *A\n> Curtain of Green* is two typesettings removed from the first American\n> edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in\n> any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences\n> between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be\n> considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted\n> the Harcourt, Brace text in its *Selected Stories* (NY, 1954), it of\n> course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some\n> importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of *A\n> Curtain of Green* is both the only one currently in print and the text\n> most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6)\n\nIn his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the\nHarcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in\nprint and the one most frequently cited.\n\n#### 471b.
