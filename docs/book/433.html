<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Fifty years have passed since <em>Kim</em> enchanted the world with its
insight into Indian life. Since then there have been countless books
which described and interpreted that teeming land, but none has
supplanted Rudyard Kipling’s radiant picture, with its people of high
and low caste, in the hearts of readers, old and young. As a tale of
picaresque adventure, as a pageant and as a social document, <em>Kim</em> is
a classic in its own field. It is storytelling at its best, with all
the vitality and color and appeal it first offered at the turn of the
century. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1901. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950.
<em>WR</em> 9 December 1950. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued
1970/71.</p>
<p>Cerf first tried to include <em>Kim</em> in the ML in 1931, perhaps as a
replacement for Kipling’s <em>Three Soldiers</em> (3) which had been
discontinued several weeks earlier, but Doubleday, Doran was not ready
to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17 February 1931). He
asked again the following year (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December
1932) with the same result. At that point he appears to have given up.
The idea of including a book by Kipling resurfaced in 1949; a week later
he decided it should be <em>Kim</em> (Cerf to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 9
November 1949 and 15 November 1949). This time Doubleday was willing to
grant reprint rights.</p>
<p>The ML paid Doubleday royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
