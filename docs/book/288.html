<p>Front flap:<br> The third novel by Dostoyevsky to be included in the Modern Library series . . . <em>The Possessed</em> has the distinction of appearing as a first American edition, in that it contains a hitherto-suppressed chapter. Avrahm Yarmolinsky, who provides a foreword and the translation of the newly discovered chapter, explains the political reasons for the suppression and the manner in which the original was released from the Russian archives. The translation of the novel is by Constance Garnett. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> <em>The Possessed</em> was written between 1870 and 1872, years in which the just-beginning Russian revolutionary movement first exploded in acts of violence. The actual murder of a member of a revolutionary circle by his fellow conspirators first gave Dostoyevsky the idea for the book in which he turned against the radicals and socialists with whom he had earlier identified. As Avrahm Yarmolinsky observes in his Foreword, “<em>The Possessed</em> testifies to the fact that Dostoyevsky was not without some insight into the nature of the upheaval from which he was separated by nearly half a century.” Revolution, however, is not the sole theme of this novel, rich in insight, imaginative power and strongly drawn characters, which ranks with Dostoyevsky’s major works.</p>

In recent decades “Dostoevsky” has become the most common transliteration of the author’s name in English-language editions of his works. “Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821–1881” remains the “authorized form” used in library catalogs to collocate the nearly 50 variant spellings that have been used to represent the author’s name in the Roman alphabet (OCLC, Library of Congress Name Authority Record n79029930.</p>

The actual murder of a member of a revolutionary circle by his fellow conspirators first gave Dostoyevsky the idea for the book in which he turned against the radicals and socialists with whom he had earlier identified. As Avrahm Yarmolinsky observes in his Foreword, “*The Possessed* testifies to the fact that Dostoyevsky was not without some insight into the nature of the upheaval from which he was separated by nearly half a century.” Revolution, however, is not the sole theme of this novel, rich in insight, imaginative power and strongly drawn characters, which ranks with Dostoyevsky’s major works.  \n\nPublished fall 1977 at \\$6.95.

In recent decades “Dostoevsky” has become the most common transliteration of the author’s name in English-language editions of his works. “Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821–1881” remains the “authorized form” used in library catalogs to collocate the nearly 50 variant spellings that have been used to represent the author’s name in the Roman alphabet (OCLC, Library of Congress Name Authority Record n79029930.  \n\n"
