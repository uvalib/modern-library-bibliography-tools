<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
André Gide combines a rich and supple imagination with a conscience
that tolerates no squeamishness in the disclosure of the most personal
intimacies. The unspeakable has no existence for him; his service to
his own truth is constant and uncompromising. Of the thirty
distinguished volumes he has published, many of them rare and
unobtainable because of their revelations, <em>The Counterfeiters</em> is his
only novel, and he has avowed in his Journal: “Without reserve, I want
to pour into it everything.” The translation is complete and
unexpurgated. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bussy translation originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May
1931. <em>WR</em> 23 May 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall
1946. <em>The Counterfeiters</em> with <em>Journal of the Counterfeiters</em>
published spring 1962 (see 216.2).</p>
<p>Cerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition of <em>The
Counterfeiters</em>, offering a $700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a
copy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a
copy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was
intended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf,
18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x
4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.</p>
<p>Knopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication
date was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the
following year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s <em>Lafcadio’s
Adventures</em>, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in
spring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for <em>The Counterfeiters</em> (Knopf
to Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the
final reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably
similar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for
renewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep <em>The
Counterfeiters</em> in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any
spectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to
Knopf, 24 October 1939).</p>
<p><em>The Counterfeiters</em> sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and
Giant sales.</p>

(*Spring 1931*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> André Gide combines a rich and supple imagination with a conscience\n> that tolerates no squeamishness in the disclosure of the most personal\n> intimacies. The unspeakable has no existence for him; his service to\n> his own truth is constant and uncompromising. Of the thirty\n> distinguished volumes he has published, many of them rare and\n> unobtainable because of their revelations, *The Counterfeiters* is his\n> only novel, and he has avowed in his Journal: “Without reserve, I want\n> to pour into it everything.” The translation is complete and\n> unexpurgated. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nBussy translation originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May\n1931. *WR* 23 May 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall\n1946. *The Counterfeiters* with *Journal of the Counterfeiters*\npublished spring 1962 (see 216.2).\n\nCerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition of *The\nCounterfeiters*, offering a $700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a\ncopy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a\ncopy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was\nintended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf,\n18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x\n4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.\n\nKnopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication\ndate was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the\nfollowing year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s *Lafcadio’s\nAdventures*, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in\nspring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for *The Counterfeiters* (Knopf\nto Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the\nfinal reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably\nsimilar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for\nrenewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep *The\nCounterfeiters* in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any\nspectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to\nKnopf, 24 October 1939).\n\n*The Counterfeiters* sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant sales.\n\n#### 216.1b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nThe Counterfeiters | LES FAUX-MONNAYEURS | by André Gide | *Translated\nfrom the French by* DOROTHY BUSSY | *Introduction by* RAYMOND WEAVER |\n\\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at left\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY\n| NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xx, \\[1–2\\] 3–372 \\[373–380\\]. \\[1–12\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\\[13\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 216.1a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] INTRODUCTION COPYRIGHT,\n1931, | BY THE MODERN LIBRARY, INC. | COPYRIGHT, 1927, BY ALFRED A.\nKNOPF, INC.; \\[373–377\\] ML list; \\[378–380\\] blank.
