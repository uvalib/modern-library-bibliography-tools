<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The enormous influence Hegel has exercised on modern politics and
philosophy, on social science, anthropology and psychology demands an
examination and evaluation of his most important works, so presented
and annotated as to make them comprehensible in themselves and in
their relationship to the contemporary world. The essence of Hegelian
thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor
Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history,
philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are
faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general
reader. <em>The Philosophy of Hegel</em> becomes another addition to the
Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such
philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant,
Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 24 October 1953. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Friedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a
copy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his
edition of <em>The Philosophy of Kant</em> (422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14
December 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the
job” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to
the ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a
devout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept.
think of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late
1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly
all of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations
about its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead
(Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951).</p>
<p>Friedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of
selections from <em>The Philosophy of History</em> and about fifty pages of
<em>Lectures on Aesthetics</em> and <em>Philosophy of Right and Law</em>. The
translation of the main part of <em>The Philosophy of History</em> is based on
the John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in
1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that
he was having to do more work on the translations than he originally
hoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952).</p>
<p>In the first printing the selections from the Introduction to <em>The</em>
<em>Philosophy of History</em> (460a, pp. [1]–43) are from “a translation
made by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor,
and published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)”
(“Note,” p. [2]). Beginning with the second printing the selections
from the Introduction (460b, pp. [1]–43) are “translated by Carl J.
Friedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind
permission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p.
[2]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first
printing and resetting pp. [1]–42 has not been ascertained.</p>
<p>Friedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold
reasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and
gratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to
Klopfer, 18 January 1960).</p>

The essence of Hegelian\n> thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor\n> Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history,\n> philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are\n> faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general\n> reader. *The Philosophy of Hegel* becomes another addition to the\n> Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such\n> philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant,\n> Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (*Fall 1953*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1953. *WR* 24 October 1953. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nFriedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a\ncopy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his\nedition of *The Philosophy of Kant* (422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14\nDecember 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the\njob” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to\nthe ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a\ndevout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept.\nthink of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late\n1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly\nall of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations\nabout its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead\n(Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951).\n\nFriedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of\nselections from *The Philosophy of History* and about fifty pages of\n*Lectures on Aesthetics* and *Philosophy of Right and Law*. The\ntranslation of the main part of *The Philosophy of History* is based on\nthe John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in\n1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that\nhe was having to do more work on the translations than he originally\nhoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952).\n\nIn the first printing the selections from the Introduction to *The*\n*Philosophy of History* (460a, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are from “a translation\nmade by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor,\nand published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)”\n(“Note,” p. \\[2\\]). Beginning with the second printing the selections\nfrom the Introduction (460b, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are “translated by Carl J.\nFriedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind\npermission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p.\n\\[2\\]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first\nprinting and resetting pp. \\[1\\]–42 has not been ascertained.\n\nFriedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold\nreasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and\ngratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to\nKlopfer, 18 January 1960).\n\n**460b.
