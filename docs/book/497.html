<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This book contains some of the best stories of all time—among them the
stories of Tristan and Isolt, Aucassin and Nicolete, Sir Gawain and
the Green Knight, and other figures of literary or historic fame. The
widely varied romances in this volume—presented here in the best
modern versions available—will provide many hours of memorably
pleasant reading.</p>
<p>The editors of this book, Roger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard
Loomis, both of Columbia University, have skillfully selected those
romances best suited to contemporary taste. Their Introduction and
their special comments before each story are certain to add to the
reader’s enjoyment of this rich legacy of medieval literature. (<em>Fall
1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published November 1957. <em>WR</em> 2 December 1957.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Stein had been considering an anthology like <em>Medieval Romances</em> for
several years. In 1952 he wrote Haskell Block of the University of
Wisconsin, “In a very tentative way I have thought of the possibility of
our doing a little collection of epic and romance in the Modern Library
some day. I don’t know whether such a thing would ever go, but I have
been asking people for suggestions as to contents . . .” (Stein to
Block, 31 October 1952).</p>
<p>Roger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis initially received
royalties of 5 cents a copy. In 1961, when ML books were selling for
$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based
on a retail price of $1.45. (<em>Medieval Romances</em> was published at $1.65,
but the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still
$1.45.) Random House usually rejected requests for higher royalties on
these grounds, but the Loomis’s royalties were increased to 10 cents a
copy.</p>
<h4><a href='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/revision/497b.html'>497b. Title page revised (1962)</a></h4>
<p>Title as 497a except line 9 (COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY) omitted.</p>
<p>Pagination as 487a. [1]<sup>16</sup> [2-7]<sup>32</sup>
[8]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Contents as 497a except <em>First</em> statement omitted from p. [iv]. (<em>Fall
1962</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> As jacket A with names of the two editors omitted from
backstrip and the line “both of Columbia University” omitted from the
front panel. The second paragraph of flap text was updated as follows:
“The editors of this book, Roger Sherman Loomis, of Columbia University,
and Laura Hibbard Loomis, have skillfully . . . ” (<em>Fall 1962</em>) <em>Note:</em>
The earliest reported printing with Laura Hibbard Loomis’s affiliation
omitted is spring 1962.</p>
<p>When <em>Medieval Romances</em> was published both editors were affiliated with
Columbia University. After Laura Hibbard Loomis’s death in 1960 her
husband may have asked that her affiliation with Columbia University be
removed from the title page and jacket. Roger Sherman Loomis’s
affiliation with Columbia continued as professor emeritus from his
retirement in 1958 until his death in 1966.</p>
