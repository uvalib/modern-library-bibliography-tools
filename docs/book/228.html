<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the whole literature of the subtle and mysterious relationship
between man and the crimes he commits, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> stands
supreme for its insight, its compassion and its psychological
fidelity. The story of the murder committed by Raskolnikov, his
punishment and atonement, is the most gripping and illuminating study
ever written of a crime of repugnance and despair, and the
consequences which arise inevitably from it. In Dostoyevsky’s mind,
crime is its own punishment and retributive justice can never be as
severe as the penalty the human soul can impose on itself. (<em>Spring
1935</em>)</p>

subsequently for regular ML printings.</p>
<p>Regular ML printings added part titles for Parts 1–6 and the Epilogue at
the head of each part (Illustrated ML printings had separate leaves for
part titles) and substituted new chapter numbers and large initial
capitals at the beginning of each chapter for those used in Illustrated
ML printings. Part titles, chapter numbers, and large initial capitals
in Illustrated Modern Library printings were designed to be printed in
gray and black; those in regular ML printings were printed in black

Dostoyevsky’s art, a shabby murder becomes the means of revealing some
of the innermost secrets of the heart.” (<em>Fall 1955</em>) <em>Note:</em> At some

<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.
The ML invited Harry Levin and then Lionel Trilling to write the
introduction. Both declined on the grounds that the $200 fee offered was
inadequate (Erskine to Levin, 26 January 1950; Stein to Trilling, 3
February 1950; Trilling to Stein, 5 February 1950). At that point Stein
telephoned Simmons, who had just accepted an invitation to write an
introduction to <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> for $200, and he agreed to do
<em>Crime and Punishment</em> instead.<strong>228.3a. Text reset; offset printing (c.

<p>*All ML editions used the spelling Dostoyevsky except <em>Best Short

“Dostoevsky” has become the most common transliteration of the author’s
name in English-language editions of his works. “Dostoyevsky, Fyodor,
1821–1881” remains the “authorized form” used in library catalogs to
collocate the nearly 50 variant spellings that have been used to
represent the author’s name in the Roman alphabet (OCLC Authority Record
Number 263592).</p>
