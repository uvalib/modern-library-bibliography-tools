blank; [3]–460 text; [461–465] ML list; [466] blank. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in strong yellow green (117) and black on pale
yellow green (121) paper with 2-line title in strong yellow green
highlighted in black and sandwiched between six strong yellow green
bands, simulating a barrel labeled TONO BUNGAY, the quack cure-all about
which the story revolves; borders in strong yellow green, other
lettering in black. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Since H. G. Wells wrote <em>Tono-Bungay</em>, his forays into prophecy and
history have made him world famous. Yet it is doubtful whether his
later fame was as firmly grounded as the first spontaneous outburst of
acclaim given to <em>Tono-Bungay</em>. With its appearance, H. G. Wells
forced immediate recognition as a major figure in contemporary English
letters. Neither time nor all the subsequent writings of the prolific
and indefatigable Mr. Wells has dimmed the sparkle and vivacity of
this chronicle of chicanery and human credulity. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Duffield &amp; Co., 1909. ML edition (225.1,
pp. [<em>5-6</em>], [1]–460) printed from Duffield &amp; Green plates.
Published December 1931. <em>WR</em> 26 December 1931. First printing: 6,000
copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in <em>Tono-Bungay</em> in 1929 when he offered
Duffield &amp; Green a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.
He indicated that the offer would stand indefinitely, and these appear
to be the terms under which the ML edition was published two years
later. The plates became the property of Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. when Dodd,
Mead bought Duffield &amp; Green in 1934.</p>
<p>By June 1936 ML printings totaled 12,000 copies and sales totaled 10,675
copies. <em>Tono-Bungay</em> sold 4,382 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

(*Fall 1931*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Since H. G. Wells wrote *Tono-Bungay*, his forays into prophecy and\n> history have made him world famous. Yet it is doubtful whether his\n> later fame was as firmly grounded as the first spontaneous outburst of\n> acclaim given to *Tono-Bungay*. With its appearance, H. G. Wells\n> forced immediate recognition as a major figure in contemporary English\n> letters. Neither time nor all the subsequent writings of the prolific\n> and indefatigable Mr. Wells has dimmed the sparkle and vivacity of\n> this chronicle of chicanery and human credulity.

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *Tono-Bungay* in 1929 when he offered\nDuffield & Green a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.\nHe indicated that the offer would stand indefinitely, and these appear\nto be the terms under which the ML edition was published two years\nlater. The plates became the property of Dodd, Mead & Co. when Dodd,\nMead bought Duffield & Green in 1934.\n\nBy June 1936 ML printings totaled 12,000 copies and sales totaled 10,675\ncopies. *Tono-Bungay* sold 4,382 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 225.1b.
