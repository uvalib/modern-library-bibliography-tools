<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in deep yellow green (118) and black on light
grayish green paper with inset illustration of a chair by a window with
gloves on the seat cushion, a vase encircled by a hand on the window
ledge, and a man with outstretched hand peering through the window into
the room; borders in deep yellow green, lettering in black. Signed:
Wuyts. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For sheer terror, for the spectral power to fasten itself upon the
imagination, stirring and tormenting it, <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> is
the apotheosis of the macabre in literature. Without abatement, it
arouses the senses and numbs them, clutches at the heart and makes it
beat faster, while it unfolds one of the greatest ghost stories of all
time. <em>The Lesson of the Master</em> portrays the inevitable penalties
imposed on those who cherish a dream of perfection. It reveals Henry
James as an incomparable story-teller and stylist. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by the Macmillan Co., 1898 (<em>The Turn of the
Screw</em>) and 1892 (<em>The Lesson of the Master</em>). ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for January
1930. <em>WR</em> 8 March 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML’s original intent was to publish <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> only, to
print from Macmillan plates, and to pay a $1,000 advance against
royalties of 8 cents a copy (H. C. Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26
November 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to
write an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March
1929).</p>
<p>Final publication plans took shape in January 1930, when Macmillan
granted permission to add <em>The Lesson of the Master</em> for an additional
payment of $100 (Latham to ML, 10 January 1930). Broun’s introduction,
dated January 1930, makes no reference to <em>The Lesson of the Master</em>.
The ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed
publication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both
works entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying
royalties of 2 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master</em> ranked in the third
quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May
1942–October 1943, just below <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> (291). James’s
sales improved significantly by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month
period November 1951–October 1952 <em>The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of
the Master</em> sold 3,734 copies, making it seventy-fourth of the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML. James’s <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> sold
5,345 copies, placing it thirty-ninth.</p>
