It is not known why the original leaf was canceled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant A:</em> Pagination as 191.1a. [1–30]<sup>16</sup>. Contents (including <em>First</em> statement) as 191.1a. <em>Note:</em> Priority with 191.1a not established; both were probably counted as part of the first printing of 20,000 copies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant B:</em> Pp. [<em>4</em>], [1–2] 3–950 [951–956]. [1–30]<sup>16</sup>.

(<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in moderate blue (182) and black on cream paper depicting a seated woman in a moderate blue costume and a large black hat; borders in moderate blue, title in moderate blue, other lettering in black. Signed: Loederer. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> No estimate of Tolstoy the writer can ignore Tolstoy the man. People of every shade of conviction look upon him as one of the few Christians since Christ, and few dispute his position as one of the most forceful and influential literary figures of the nineteenth century. <em>Anna Karenina</em> is considered his greatest novel, and Anna, the protagonist, the most notable character in the vast gallery of his creations. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original U.S. publication of Constance Garnett translation not ascertained. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1930. <em>WR</em> 8 March 1930. First printing: 20,000 copies. Superseded fall 1965 by revised translation (191.2). Klopfer asked the ML’s printer to order enough paper for 20,000 copies of <em>Anna Karenina</em> (Klopfer to Mr. Wilkins, H. Wolff Estate, 4 December 1929). The paper was the same stock used for <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> (171.1a).</p>
<p><em>Anna Karenina</em> appears to have been the best-selling title in the ML in 1931 and the eighth best-selling title in 1934. It ranked low in the first quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and moved up a few notches during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flap text revised:  <br> No estimate of Tolstoy the writer can be of any meaning if it disregards Tolstoy the man. As a man, he represents the best of nineteenth-century humanitarianism and a generous Christian morality. As a writer, he towers above all the literary figures of his time, and his two great novels—<em>War and Peace</em> (Modern Library Giant G-1) and <em>Anna Karenina</em>—are universally acclaimed as classics. Anna of the latter novel is considered the most notable character in the vast gallery of the great and obscure people who live in the pages of his works. The translation from the Russian by Constance Garnett is complete and unabridged. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Several authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat accepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale University. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed, “Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of Anna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs. Karenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28 January 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that were corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to extend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek was willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance against a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart for his introduction to Gogol’s <em>Dead Souls</em>. Stein indicated that $200 was all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to Stein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon College and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell University, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an introduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in any case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March 1950).<br>
Troyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s $200 fee (Troyat to Stein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J. Robert Loy of Columbia University.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> <em>ANNA KARENINA</em> was begun in 1873, seven years after the publication of <em>War and Peace</em>, and appeared in installments from 1875 to 1877. It is one of Tolstoy’s masterpieces, written at the height of his power and reflecting almost every aspect of his method and attitudes.
Leonard J. Kent and Nina Berberova have revised the Constance Garnett translation, in the interests of clarity and accuracy, and, where necessary, to offer a better rendering in English of the sense of the original Russian. They have also provided an Introduction and notes on the text.</p>

(*Fall 1929*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in moderate blue (182) and black on cream paper depicting a seated woman in a moderate blue costume and a large black hat; borders in moderate blue, title in moderate blue, other lettering in black. Signed: Loederer. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> No estimate of Tolstoy the writer can ignore Tolstoy the man. People of every shade of conviction look upon him as one of the few Christians since Christ, and few dispute his position as one of the most forceful and influential literary figures of the nineteenth century. *Anna Karenina* is considered his greatest novel, and Anna, the protagonist, the most notable character in the vast gallery of his creations. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginal U.S. publication of Constance Garnett translation not ascertained. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing: 20,000 copies. Superseded fall 1965 by revised translation (191.2). Klopfer asked the ML’s printer to order enough paper for 20,000 copies of *Anna Karenina* (Klopfer to Mr. Wilkins, H. Wolff Estate, 4 December 1929). The paper was the same stock used for *The Brothers Karamazov* (171.1a).  \n\n*Anna Karenina* appears to have been the best-selling title in the ML in 1931 and the eighth best-selling title in 1934. It ranked low in the first quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and moved up a few notches during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 191.1b.

(*Fall 1950*)  \n\n*Jacket C2:* As jacket C1 except in deep green (142) instead of very dark green.  \n\n> Flap text revised:  <br> No estimate of Tolstoy the writer can be of any meaning if it disregards Tolstoy the man. As a man, he represents the best of nineteenth-century humanitarianism and a generous Christian morality. As a writer, he towers above all the literary figures of his time, and his two great novels—*War and Peace* (Modern Library Giant G-1) and *Anna Karenina*—are universally acclaimed as classics. Anna of the latter novel is considered the most notable character in the vast gallery of the great and obscure people who live in the pages of his works. The translation from the Russian by Constance Garnett is complete and unabridged. (*Fall 1952*)  \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Several authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat accepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale University. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed, “Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of Anna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs. Karenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28 January 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that were corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to extend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek was willing, but instead of the ML’s \\$200 fee he wanted a \\$500 advance against a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart for his introduction to Gogol’s *Dead Souls*. Stein indicated that \\$200 was all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to Stein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon College and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell University, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an introduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in any case his fee would be \\$500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March 1950).  \nTroyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s \\$200 fee (Troyat to Stein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J. Robert Loy of Columbia University.  \n\n#### 191.2. Translation revised (1965)  \n\n[left page of 2-page spread] EDITED AND INTRODUCED BY | LEONARD J.

It is one of Tolstoy’s masterpieces, written at the height of his power and reflecting almost every aspect of his method and attitudes. \nLeonard J. Kent and Nina Berberova have revised the Constance Garnett translation, in the interests of clarity and accuracy, and, where necessary, to offer a better rendering in English of the sense of the original Russian. They have also provided an Introduction and notes on the text.  \n\nOriginally published as ML Giant (G21.2a), September 1965.
