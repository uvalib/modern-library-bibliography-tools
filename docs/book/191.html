<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No estimate of Tolstoy the writer can ignore Tolstoy the man. People
of every shade of conviction look upon him as one of the few
Christians since Christ, and few dispute his position as one of the
most forceful and influential literary figures of the nineteenth
century. <em>Anna Karenina</em> is considered his greatest novel, and Anna,
the protagonist, the most notable character in the vast gallery of his
creations. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original U.S. publication of Constance Garnett translation not
ascertained**.** ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published February 1930. <em>WR</em> 8 March 1930. First printing:
20,000 copies. Superseded fall 1965 by revised translation (191.2).
Klopfer asked the ML’s printer to order enough paper for 20,000 copies
of <em>Anna Karenina</em> (Klopfer to Mr. Wilkins, H. Wolff Estate, 4 December
1929). The paper was the same stock used for <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>
(171.1a).</p>
<p><em>Anna Karenina</em> appears to have been the best-selling title in the ML in
1931 and the eighth best-selling title in 1934. It ranked low in the
first quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October
1943 and moved up a few notches during the 12-month period November
1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Flap text revised:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No estimate of Tolstoy the writer can be of any meaning if it
disregards Tolstoy the man. As a man, he represents the best of
nineteenth-century humanitarianism and a generous Christian morality.
As a writer, he towers above all the literary figures of his time, and
his two great novels—<em>War and Peace</em> (Modern Library Giant G-1) and
<em>Anna Karenina</em>—are universally acclaimed as classics. Anna of the
latter novel is considered the most notable character in the vast
gallery of the great and obscure people who live in the pages of his
works. The translation from the Russian by Constance Garnett is
complete and unabridged. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.
Several authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat
accepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale
University. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed,
“Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of
Anna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs.
Karenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28
January 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that
were corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to
extend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek
was willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance
against a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart
for his introduction to Gogol’s <em>Dead Souls</em>. Stein indicated that $200
was all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to
Stein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon
College and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell
University, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an
introduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in
any case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March
1950).</p>
<p>Troyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s $200 fee (Troyat to
Stein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J.
Robert Loy of Columbia University.</p>

Published February 1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing:\n20,000 copies. Superseded fall 1965 by revised translation (191.2).\nKlopfer asked the ML’s printer to order enough paper for 20,000 copies\nof *Anna Karenina* (Klopfer to Mr. Wilkins, H. Wolff Estate, 4 December\n1929). The paper was the same stock used for *The Brothers Karamazov*\n(171.1a).\n\n*Anna Karenina* appears to have been the best-selling title in the ML in\n1931 and the eighth best-selling title in 1934. It ranked low in the\nfirst quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October\n1943 and moved up a few notches during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 191.1b.

As a man, he represents the best of\n> nineteenth-century humanitarianism and a generous Christian morality.\n> As a writer, he towers above all the literary figures of his time, and\n> his two great novels—*War and Peace* (Modern Library Giant G-1) and\n> *Anna Karenina*—are universally acclaimed as classics. Anna of the\n> latter novel is considered the most notable character in the vast\n> gallery of the great and obscure people who live in the pages of his\n> works. The translation from the Russian by Constance Garnett is\n> complete and unabridged. (*Fall 1952*)\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.\nSeveral authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat\naccepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale\nUniversity. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed,\n“Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of\nAnna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs.\nKarenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28\nJanuary 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that\nwere corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to\nextend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek\nwas willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance\nagainst a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart\nfor his introduction to Gogol’s *Dead Souls*. Stein indicated that $200\nwas all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to\nStein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon\nCollege and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell\nUniversity, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an\nintroduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in\nany case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March\n1950).\n\nTroyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s $200 fee (Troyat to\nStein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J.\nRobert Loy of Columbia University.",
