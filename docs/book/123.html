<blockquote>
<p>Text on front: <br> This romance originally published under the title of “The Virgins of the Rocks”, was written by D’Annunzio when his position as the greatest modern Italian master of prose was already secure. Other of his novels in the Modern Library series are “The Flame of Life”, (volume number 65), “The Child of Pleasure”, (volume number 98), and “The Triumph of Death”, (volume number 112). (<em>Spring 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by George H. Richmond &amp; Son, 1898, and subsequently by L. C. Page &amp; Co., 1902. ML edition (pp. [1]–296) printed from Richmond/Page plates. Publication announced for May 1926. <em>WR</em> 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1928.</p>
<p>Lewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so aggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you, it appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that are absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the privilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being, at least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list, although some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder or The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box 128, L. C. Page &amp; Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm commitment on Liveright’s part to include both <em>The Maidens of the Rocks</em> and <em>The Intruder</em> in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the series he demanded that they pay advances of $240 against royalties of 8 cents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him $480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other the following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10 September 1925).</p>
<p><em>The Maidens of the Rocks</em> sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the beginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year. Page responded with a pitch for <em>The Intruder</em>, noting that it was part of the trilogy that included <em>The Child of Pleasure</em> and <em>The Flame of Life</em> and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described <em>The Maidens of the Rocks</em> as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough story, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers of the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind any of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always run neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to the two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He concluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the other three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want children’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page to Cerf, 7 February 1927).</p>
<p>Cerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The Intruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the advance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong feeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library with a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).</p>

(*Fall 1925*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n> Text on front: <br> This romance originally published under the title of “The Virgins of the Rocks”, was written by D’Annunzio when his position as the greatest modern Italian master of prose was already secure. Other of his novels in the Modern Library series are “The Flame of Life”, (volume number 65), “The Child of Pleasure”, (volume number 98), and “The Triumph of Death”, (volume number 112). (*Spring 1926*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Richmond & Son, 1898, and subsequently by L. C. Page & Co., 1902. ML edition (pp. [1]–296) printed from Richmond/Page plates. Publication announced for May 1926. *WR* 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1928.  \n\nLewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so aggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you, it appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that are absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the privilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being, at least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list, although some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder or The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box 128, L. C. Page & Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm commitment on Liveright’s part to include both *The Maidens of the Rocks* and *The Intruder* in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the series he demanded that they pay advances of \\$240 against royalties of 8 cents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him \\$480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other the following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10 September 1925).  \n\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the beginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year. Page responded with a pitch for *The Intruder*, noting that it was part of the trilogy that included *The Child of Pleasure* and *The Flame of Life* and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described *The Maidens of the Rocks* as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough story, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers of the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind any of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always run neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to the two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He concluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the other three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want children’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page to Cerf, 7 February 1927).  \n\nCerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The Intruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the advance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong feeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library with a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> D’Annunzio, *Flame of Life* (1918–1936) 62<br> D’Annunzio, *Triumph of Death* (1923–1931) 102<br> D’Annunzio, *Child of Pleasure* (1925–1931) 113  \n\n",
