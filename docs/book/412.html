<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This 850-page anthology brings together the most complete collection
of poetry ever devoted exclusively to the theme of man’s aspiration
toward liberty. The poets range from the early Greeks to the young men
in the Second World War who were inspired by the ever-new hope of a
better, freer world. In its three general divisions, this volume
includes the great lyric and dramatic writers of Britain and her
Dominions, American poets and the champions of freedom from the
Orient, the Near East, the European nations, and the entire civilized
world. (<em>Fall 1948</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1945. ML edition (pp. v–820)
printed from Random House plates. Published fall 1948. <em>WR</em> 23 October
1948. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1955.</p>
<p>The Random House edition sold out its first printing of 3,000 copies
within two months. An order from the American Red Cross for 810 copies
had to be filled from the second printing (Cerf to Benét, 18 July 1945).
Random House did not originally plan to include <em>Poetry of Freedom</em> in
the ML. The reprint agreements for copyrighted poems applied to the
Random House edition only, and new permissions had to be secured for the
ML edition. Some publishers did not charge an additional fee for the ML
edition while others asked for half of the original fee. Knopf was the
only publisher who wanted the original fee to be paid again in full.</p>
