<p><strong>WILLIAM FAULKNER. LIGHT IN AUGUST. 1950– . (ML 88)</strong></p>
<h4>429.1a. First printing (1950)</h4>
<p>[<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/E3.webp'>torchbearer E3</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | Light in August | <em>by WILLIAM FAULKNER</em> | Introduction by Richard H. Rovere | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK</p>
<p>Pp. [i–iv] v–xiv, [1–2] 3–444 [445–450]. [1–13]<sup>16</sup> [14]<sup>8</sup> [15]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] Copyright, 1932, by William Faulkner | Copyright, 1950, by Random House, Inc. | All rights reserved | [short rule] | FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION, 1950; v–xiv INTRODUCTION | [short swelled rule] | <em>by RICHARD H. ROVERE</em> dated p. xiv: <em>April, 1950</em>; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–444 text; [445–450] ML list. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Non-pictorial in brilliant yellow (83), black and yellowish gray (93) on coated white paper with brilliant yellow panel at left and wider black panel at right; “L” of title in black on yellow panel with arm adjoining black panel, rest of title in reverse on black panel with upper portion of letters “GHT” in first word of title shaded in yellowish gray; authorship statement: By [in yellowish gray] WILLIAM FAULKNER [in black] on horizontal white bar crossing both panels; other lettering on black panel in yellowish gray (INTRODUCTION BY), reverse (RICHARD H. ROVERE), and brilliant yellow (A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK). Designed by E. McKnight Kauffer; unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> In the judgment of the foremost literary men of the world, William Faulkner stands pre-eminent among living American novelists. These critics may differ in their preference of any one of his fifteen novels over any other, but all are in agreement that <em>Light in August</em> is one of the finest among his major works. For its vitality, its scope, its imagination and, above all, its compassion, it is more than a novelist’s achievement; it is an experience in which the reader becomes a deeply involved participant. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except in brilliant yellow (83) and black only. Yellowish gray shading omitted from title, “By” in black instead of yellowish gray, “INTRODUCTION BY” in reverse instead of yellowish gray; other lettering on black panel as jacket A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap reset with the following revisions in the second sentence: “fifteen” omitted, “finest” changed to “most distinguished”. (<em>Fall 1955; Fall 1962</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1932. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950. <em>WR</em> 30 September 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies.</p>
<p>Random House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith and Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML was <em>Sanctuary</em> (233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of Faulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles were added until 1946, when <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> (394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new typesetting. The publication of that volume, together with <em>The Portable Faulkner</em>, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few months earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a major American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. The Modern Library edition of <em>Light in August</em>, published four years after <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em>, became the third Faulkner volume in the series.</p>
<p>The ML reset <em>Light in August</em> because Smith and Haas had not made plates. All four Smith and Haas printings had been from standing type which had since been melted. The only previous reprint edition of <em>Light in August</em>, published by New Directions in its Modern Readers series in 1947, was photographically reproduced from the Smith and Haas edition and printed by offset lithography.</p>
<p>In addition to the first printing of 7,500 copies, printings of 429.1a were as follows: 5,000 copies (1951), 5,000 copies (1952), 5,000 copies (1953), 5,000 copies (1954), two printings of 5,000 copies each (1955), 5,000 copies (1956), three printings of 5,000 copies each (1957), four printings of 5,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 10,000 copies (1959), 10,000 copies (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the period 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so.</p>
<h4>429.1b. Rovere introduction dropped (1963)</h4>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform Faulkner jacket on coated white paper with lettering in vivid yellowish green (129) and black.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> First published in October, 1932, <em>Light in August</em> was the seventh of Faulkner’s novels to appear. Unquestionably one of his masterworks, it has always stood near or at the top of any critic’s attempted listing of the author’s works in the order of their excellence or importance; and it will continue to be one of the most widely read, studied, and written about novels of this century. (<em>Spring 1963</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from ML printings of <em>Sanctuary</em> and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> was dated 14 November 1962 (RHC box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s <em>Light in August</em> was also dropped around this time. Introductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for <em>Light in August</em> in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, including <em>Light in August</em>, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—<em>Selected Short Stories</em>, <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, <em>A Fable</em>, and <em>Pylon</em> —were new to the ML. Two, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, had previously been combined in a single ML volume.</p>

  "full": "\n**WILLIAM FAULKNER. LIGHT IN AUGUST. 1950– . (ML 88)** \n\n#### 429.1a. First printing (1950) \n\n[torchbearer E3] | Light in August | *by WILLIAM FAULKNER* | Introduction by Richard H. Rovere | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK \n\nPp. [i–iv] v–xiv, [1–2] 3–444 [445–450]. [1–13]<sup>16</sup> [14]<sup>8</sup> [15]<sup>16</sup> \n\n[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] Copyright, 1932, by William Faulkner | Copyright, 1950, by Random House, Inc. | All rights reserved | [short rule] | FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION, 1950; v–xiv INTRODUCTION | [short swelled rule] | *by RICHARD H. ROVERE* dated p. xiv: *April, 1950*; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–444 text; [445–450] ML list. (*Spring 1950*) \n\n*Jacket A:* Non-pictorial in brilliant yellow (83), black and yellowish gray (93) on coated white paper with brilliant yellow panel at left and wider black panel at right; “L” of title in black on yellow panel with arm adjoining black panel, rest of title in reverse on black panel with upper portion of letters “GHT” in first word of title shaded in yellowish gray; authorship statement: By [in yellowish gray] WILLIAM FAULKNER [in black] on horizontal white bar crossing both panels; other lettering on black panel in yellowish gray (INTRODUCTION BY), reverse (RICHARD H. ROVERE), and brilliant yellow (A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK). Designed by E. McKnight Kauffer; unsigned. \n\n> Front flap:<br> In the judgment of the foremost literary men of the world, William Faulkner stands pre-eminent among living American novelists. These critics may differ in their preference of any one of his fifteen novels over any other, but all are in agreement that *Light in August* is one of the finest among his major works. For its vitality, its scope, its imagination and, above all, its compassion, it is more than a novelist’s achievement; it is an experience in which the reader becomes a deeply involved participant. (*Fall 1950*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except in brilliant yellow (83) and black only. Yellowish gray shading omitted from title, “By” in black instead of yellowish gray, “INTRODUCTION BY” in reverse instead of yellowish gray; other lettering on black panel as jacket A. \n\n> Front flap reset with the following revisions in the second sentence: “fifteen” omitted, “finest” changed to “most distinguished”. (*Fall 1955; Fall 1962*) \n\nOriginally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1932. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950. *WR* 30 September 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies. \n\nRandom House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith and Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML was *Sanctuary* (233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of Faulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles were added until 1946, when *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new typesetting. The publication of that volume, together with *The Portable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few months earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a major American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. The Modern Library edition of *Light in August*, published four years after *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*, became the third Faulkner volume in the series. \n\nThe ML reset *Light in August* because Smith and Haas had not made plates. All four Smith and Haas printings had been from standing type which had since been melted. The only previous reprint edition of *Light in August*, published by New Directions in its Modern Readers series in 1947, was photographically reproduced from the Smith and Haas edition and printed by offset lithography. \n\nIn addition to the first printing of 7,500 copies, printings of 429.1a were as follows: 5,000 copies (1951), 5,000 copies (1952), 5,000 copies (1953), 5,000 copies (1954), two printings of 5,000 copies each (1955), 5,000 copies (1956), three printings of 5,000 copies each (1957), four printings of 5,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 10,000 copies (1959), 10,000 copies (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the period 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so. \n\n#### 429.1b. Rovere introduction dropped (1963) \n\nTitle as 429.1a through line 3; line 4: THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK. \n\nPp. [*4*], [1–2] 3–444. [1]<sup>16</sup> [2–7]<sup>32</sup> [8]<sup>16</sup> \n\nContents as 429.1a except: [*1*] half title; [*2*] blank; [*3*] title; [*4*] Copyright, 1932, by William Faulkner | Copyright, 1950, by Random House, Inc. | All rights reserved | [short rule]. \n\n> *Variant:* Pagination and collation as 429.1b. Contents as 429.1b except: [*4*] COPYRIGHT, 1932, AND RENEWED, 1959, | BY WILLIAM FAULKNER (*Fall 1964 jacket*) \n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform Faulkner jacket on coated white paper with lettering in vivid yellowish green (129) and black. \n\n> Front flap:<br> First published in October, 1932, *Light in August* was the seventh of Faulkner’s novels to appear. Unquestionably one of his masterworks, it has always stood near or at the top of any critic’s attempted listing of the author’s works in the order of their excellence or importance; and it will continue to be one of the most widely read, studied, and written about novels of this century. (*Spring 1963*) \n\nThe memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from ML printings of *Sanctuary* and *Absalom, Absalom!* was dated 14 November 1962 (RHC box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s *Light in August* was also dropped around this time. Introductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, including *Light in August*, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—*Selected Short Stories*, *Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and *Pylon* —were new to the ML. Two, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, had previously been combined in a single ML volume. \n\n#### 429.2. Offset lithographic printing photographed from Smith and Haas edition (1965) \n\nLIGHT IN | AUGUST | WILLIAM FAULKNER | [line drawing of shack with sunlight streaming through clouds] | [torchbearer H] THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK \n\nPp.

[*3*], 1–480) printed from offset plates photographically reproduced from the first printing (Smith & Haas, 1932) with title-page imprint revised.

The title page drawing was used on Smith and Haas printings and subsequent printings from offset plates where the text is reproduced photographically from the Smith and Haas edition. The drawing is signed “RF” at the lower right but the artist has not been identified. \n\nIn addition to ML 429.2, printings from offset plates were published by Random House, April 1967; MLCE with an introduction by Cleanth Brooks, 1968; and Vintage Books, January 1972. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library:</span> \nFaulkner, *Sanctuary* (1930–1971) \nFaulkner, *Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (1946–1966) 394 \nFaulkner, *Absalom, Absalom!* (1951– ) 434 \nFaulkner, *Go Down, Moses* (1955– ) 473 \nFaulkner, *Faulkner Reader* (Giant, 1959–1990) G93 \nFaulkner, *Selected Short Stories* (1962– ) 539 \nFaulkner, *Intruder in the Dust* (1964– ) 567 \nFaulkner, *A Fable* (1966–1971) 585 \nFaulkner, *Sound and the Fury* (1966– ) 593 \nFaulkner, *As I Lay Dying* (1967– ) 596 \nFaulkner, *Pylon* (1967–1970) 599 \nFaulkner, *Wild Palms* (1984– ) 640 \n\n",
