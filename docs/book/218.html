FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION | 1931; v–x PREFACE signed p. x: <span
class="smallcaps">Ernest Boyd</span>; 1–380 text; [381–382] blank.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<p>Pinkerton translation originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch,
1914, using sheets of the British edition published by Martin Secker.
New bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by
Ernest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published July 1931. <em>WR</em> 15 August 1931. First (and only)
printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.</p>
<p>The ML paid Viking an $800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy.
The ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large
for its format.</p>
<p>Sales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other
advance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six
months of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to
competition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger
than the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in
1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches
taller than the ML edition.</p>
<p>The ML reprinted <em>Sanine</em> on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press
owned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act
restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the
U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast <em>Sanine</em>
irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the
unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold
Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be
made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and
would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf
suggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was
entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance
had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton
translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s
shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates
(Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates,
and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold
copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).</p>

(*Spring 1931*)\n\nPinkerton translation originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch,\n1914, using sheets of the British edition published by Martin Secker.\nNew bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by\nErnest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published July 1931. *WR* 15 August 1931. First (and only)\nprinting: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.\n\nThe ML paid Viking an $800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy.\nThe ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large\nfor its format.\n\nSales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other\nadvance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six\nmonths of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to\ncompetition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger\nthan the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in\n1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches\ntaller than the ML edition.\n\nThe ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press\nowned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act\nrestricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the\nU.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine*\nirretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the\nunauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold\nGuinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be\nmade. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and\nwould not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf\nsuggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was\nentirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance\nhad been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton\ntranslation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s\nshoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates\n(Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates,\nand Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold\ncopies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).\n\n***Fall***",
