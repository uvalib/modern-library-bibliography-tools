<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Long before <em>Of Mice and Men</em> became a best-seller and thrust its
author into the national limelight, John Steinbeck had built a solid
reputation upon his novel, <em>Tortilla Flat</em>. This carefree tale of the
exploits of three lovable rogues won the unanimous praise of critics
and reading public alike. Now it is included in the Modern Library
series, partly as a tribute to the novel’s own enchantment and partly
because John Steinbeck has earned the right to a place in a library of
the foremost writers of our time. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Covici, Friede, 1935; publishing rights
and plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp.
v–[317]) printed from Covici, Friede (later Covici, Friede/Viking)
plates. Published September 1937. <em>WR</em> 25 September 1937. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Steinbeck’s foreword begins: “When this book was written, it did not
occur to me that paisanos were curious or quaint, dispossessed or
underdoggish. They are people whom I know and like, people who merge
successfully with their habitat. . . . Had I known that these stories
and these people would be considered quaint, I think I never should have
written them” (p. [i]). When he submitted the foreword he told Cerf,
“It is the only thing I want to say. If it won’t do—throw it out and
have someone else do it. This is not a clever introduction” (Steinbeck
to Cerf, undated but probably June 1937). He also asked that the ML
edition be dedicated to Susan Gregory of Monterey. The dedication was
retained in later Viking printings.</p>
<p>Subsequent printings of the ML edition include the following: 3,000
copies (August 1938); 3,000 copies (July 1939); 5,000 copies (December
1939); 2,000 copies (July 1941); 6,000 copies (December 1942). <em>Tortilla
Flat</em> sold 13,432 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, making it the fourth best-selling title in the
regular series and thirteenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. The
unusually strong sales of <em>Tortilla Flat</em> at this period may have been
stimulated by the release of the 1942 film version starring Spencer
Tracy and Hedy Lamarr.</p>
<p>During the same period <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> (341) ranked in the first
quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 9,495 copies. <em>Of Mice and
Men</em> (311) and <em>In Dubious Battle</em> (322) were in the second quarter with
sales of 7,020 copies and 6,028 copies respectively. By the early 1950s
(November 1951–October 1952) <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> was the only
Steinbeck title among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Tortilla Flat</em>, which appeared in 1935, was the first of Steinbeck’s
novels to receive wide attention. He was disturbed by the response to
this portrait of a group of carefree <em>paisanos</em> in a Monterey slum,
writing two years later that “I shall never again subject to the
vulgar touch of the <em>decent</em> these good people of laughter and
kindness, of honest lusts and direct eyes, of courtesy beyond
politeness.” If today, Steinbeck’s own view of Danny and his friends
seems to some shallow and condescending, that is a measure of the time
in which he wrote and the impact of his writing on the change in our
attitudes. Steinbeck tells this story with warmth and liveliness, and
it remains a document of a period when even this glimpse of a
different slice of life could be considered shocking.</p>

Designed by Paul Galdone, July\n1937; unsigned.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Long before *Of Mice and Men* became a best-seller and thrust its\n> author into the national limelight, John Steinbeck had built a solid\n> reputation upon his novel, *Tortilla Flat*. This carefree tale of the\n> exploits of three lovable rogues won the unanimous praise of critics\n> and reading public alike. Now it is included in the Modern Library\n> series, partly as a tribute to the novel’s own enchantment and partly\n> because John Steinbeck has earned the right to a place in a library of\n> the foremost writers of our time. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Covici, Friede, 1935; publishing rights\nand plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp.\nv–\\[317\\]) printed from Covici, Friede (later Covici, Friede/Viking)\nplates. Published September 1937. *WR* 25 September 1937. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nSteinbeck’s foreword begins: “When this book was written, it did not\noccur to me that paisanos were curious or quaint, dispossessed or\nunderdoggish. They are people whom I know and like, people who merge\nsuccessfully with their habitat. . . . Had I known that these stories\nand these people would be considered quaint, I think I never should have\nwritten them” (p. \\[i\\]). When he submitted the foreword he told Cerf,\n“It is the only thing I want to say. If it won’t do—throw it out and\nhave someone else do it. This is not a clever introduction” (Steinbeck\nto Cerf, undated but probably June 1937). He also asked that the ML\nedition be dedicated to Susan Gregory of Monterey. The dedication was\nretained in later Viking printings.\n\nSubsequent printings of the ML edition include the following: 3,000\ncopies (August 1938); 3,000 copies (July 1939); 5,000 copies (December\n1939); 2,000 copies (July 1941); 6,000 copies (December 1942). *Tortilla\nFlat* sold 13,432 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the fourth best-selling title in the\nregular series and thirteenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. The\nunusually strong sales of *Tortilla Flat* at this period may have been\nstimulated by the release of the 1942 film version starring Spencer\nTracy and Hedy Lamarr.\n\nDuring the same period *The Grapes of Wrath* (341) ranked in the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 9,495 copies. *Of Mice and\nMen* (311) and *In Dubious Battle* (322) were in the second quarter with\nsales of 7,020 copies and 6,028 copies respectively. By the early 1950s\n(November 1951–October 1952) *The Grapes of Wrath* was the only\nSteinbeck title among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\n#### 304b.

Steinbeck tells this story with warmth and liveliness, and\n> it remains a document of a period when even this glimpse of a\n> different slice of life could be considered shocking.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSteinbeck, *Of Mice and Men* (1938– ) 311\n\nSteinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* (1939–1971) 322\n\nSteinbeck, *Grapes of Wrath* (1941–1959) 341",
