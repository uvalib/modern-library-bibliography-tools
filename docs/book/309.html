<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No criminologist of our time has approached Edmund Pearson for his
accuracy in probing into the hidden motives and mysterious
circumstances of famous homicides. <em>Studies in Murder</em> is the book by
which he is best known. Originally, it contained analyses of the weird
cases of Lizzie Borden, Benjamin Nathan, Captain Nash, Mabel Page and
others. In the Modern Library edition two world-renowned cases are
added, those of Bruno Hauptmann and the insurance murder of the almost
indestructible Michael Malloy, with an essay, “Do We Execute Innocent
People?” (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by the Macmillan Co., 1924. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting with illustrations omitted and three
chapters added: “Malloy the Mighty,” “Hauptmann and Circumstantial
Evidence,” and “Do We Execute Innocent People?” Published February 1938.
<em>WR</em> 12 February 1938. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
fall 1950.</p>
<p>The plates of the Macmillan edition were too large for the ML’s format.
The added chapters in the ML edition were originally published in <em>The
New Yorker</em>: “Malloy the Mighty” (23 September 1933), “Hauptmann and
Circumstantial Evidence” (9 March 1935), and “Do We Execute Innocent
People?” (22 June 1935). The Appendix is reprinted from the Macmillan
edition and includes sources and acknowledgments for the first five
chapters only.</p>
<p><em>Studies in Murder</em> sold 3,713 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant
titles.</p>
