<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>  The philosopher of the hopelessness of the human predicament, is the oracle of the young and the disenchanted. For those who dream of the unattainable and those who attain the sad reality of a dream, the  cynical incisiveness of his writings has a singular charm and  persuasion. This volume, edited by the foremost authority on  Schopenhauer in America, Professor Irwin Edman, includes in essence                               the masterpiece, <em>The World as Will and Idea</em> and all of the famous  essay, <em>The Metaphysics of the Love of the Sexes</em>. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>  The first of modern philosophers to insist on the primacy of will over  intellect, Schopenhauer, who himself derived much of his thought from  Kant, started a movement whose influence was felt by Nietzsche, James,  Bergson and Dewey. The continuing popularity of his work, however,  rests not on his influence on other thinkers of his time or on the  logical strength of his metaphysics, but on his resonant prose, and  the accessibility to the nonacademic reader of what Irwin Edman calls,  in his introduction, a “philosophy in the old and appealing meaning of  the wisdom of life. . . . the alert, half-sad, half-cynical harvest of  a candid eye.”</p>
</blockquote>
