<p><em>Jacket A a</em>s 94.2 jacket: Pictorial in dark olive green (126), grayish

<p>Front flap as 94.1e**:**</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For more than three-quarters of a century Walt Whitman has stood
unique among the poets of the world. Publication of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
in 1855 marked the emergence upon the world scene of one of America’s
most noteworthy personalities. His poetry, at once the most intensely
personal in literature and of the most pervasive influence, has taken
its place among the sublime utterances of man. Appropriately, the
introduction to the Modern Library edition of the complete <em>Leaves of
Grass</em> was written by Walt Whitman’s most distinguished American
disciple, Carl Sandburg. (<em>Spring 1951; Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A</em> with front flap rewritten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than almost any other literary classic, Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of
Grass</em> is not only a work of art but the capturing in print of the
turbulence and tenderness of a poet’s personality. Whitman himself,
conscious that <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was his own great monument, never
ceased revising, polishing and adding to it, so that he could truly
say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is no book, Who touches
this book touches a man.” The present edition by Professor John
Kouwenhoven of Barnard College reprints the excellent and
authoritative “deathbed edition” of 1892, to which has been added the
posthumously published “Old Age Echoes” and a generous selection of
prose, including all of <em>Specimen Days</em>. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in light olive (106), strong reddish brown (40)
and black on coated white paper with right profile drawing of olive
panel at left; lettering in strong reddish brown, light olive and black
on wider white panel at right; “Walt Whitman” in black script across
both panels. Front flap as jacket A, rewritten text. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML collection superseding Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (94).
Published spring 1951 in the regular ML. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular
ML. <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (94) was on the first list of titles scheduled for
MLCE. Kouwenhoven indicated that the ML needed a thoroughly revised
volume of Whitman’s writings when Stein invited him to write a new
introduction for the College Edition. Stein agreed and offered him a
flat fee of $250 to select and edit the text and write the introduction,
noting that the new edition would assure the ML of “a book considerably
more desirable than that offered by any competitors, not only in terms
of quantity of material but in terms of the more complete picture it
gives of Whitman himself” (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 25 January 1950; 5
April 1950; 10 April 1950). Stein sent Kouwenhoven an additional $100
when <em>Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose</em> was added to the regular ML
(Stein to Kouwenhoven, 28 June 1951).</p>
<p>The 94.2 jacket with its outdated flap reference to Carl Sandburg’s
introduction remained in use through 1953. The flap text was revised in
spring 1954. ML catalogs began to list the title as <em>Leaves of Grass and
Selected Prose</em> in spring 1954; ML lists inside the jackets and at the
end of ML volumes continued to list it as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.</p>
<p>Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was one of four works that were published in
the regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included
in all three series were Cervantes, <em>Don Quixote</em> (1930: 197), Giant
(1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Dostoyevsky, <em>Brothers Karamazov</em>
(1929: 171), Giant (1937: G34), Illus ML (1943: IML 2); Fielding,
<em>History of Tom Jones</em> (1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943:
IML 5).</p>

sentence revised:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than almost any other literary classic, Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of
Grass</em> is not only a work of art; it captures in print the unique
personality of a poet as well as an aspect of the American
consciousness. Whitman himself, aware that <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was his
own great monument, never ceased revising, polishing and adding to it,
so that he could truly say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is
no book, Who touches this book touches a man.” This edition, edited by

Designed by\nWarren Chappell; unsigned.\n\nFront flap as 94.1e**:**\n\n> For more than three-quarters of a century Walt Whitman has stood\n> unique among the poets of the world. Publication of *Leaves of Grass*\n> in 1855 marked the emergence upon the world scene of one of America’s\n> most noteworthy personalities. His poetry, at once the most intensely\n> personal in literature and of the most pervasive influence, has taken\n> its place among the sublime utterances of man. Appropriately, the\n> introduction to the Modern Library edition of the complete *Leaves of\n> Grass* was written by Walt Whitman’s most distinguished American\n> disciple, Carl Sandburg. (*Spring 1951; Spring 1953*)\n\n*Jacket A* with front flap rewritten:\n\n> More than almost any other literary classic, Walt Whitman’s *Leaves of\n> Grass* is not only a work of art but the capturing in print of the\n> turbulence and tenderness of a poet’s personality. Whitman himself,\n> conscious that *Leaves of Grass* was his own great monument, never\n> ceased revising, polishing and adding to it, so that he could truly\n> say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is no book, Who touches\n> this book touches a man.” The present edition by Professor John\n> Kouwenhoven of Barnard College reprints the excellent and\n> authoritative “deathbed edition” of 1892, to which has been added the\n> posthumously published “Old Age Echoes” and a generous selection of\n> prose, including all of *Specimen Days*. (*Spring 1954*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in light olive (106), strong reddish brown (40)\nand black on coated white paper with right profile drawing of olive\npanel at left; lettering in strong reddish brown, light olive and black\non wider white panel at right; “Walt Whitman” in black script across\nboth panels. Front flap as jacket A, rewritten text. (*Fall 1958*)\n\nOriginal ML collection superseding Whitman’s *Leaves of Grass* (94).\nPublished spring 1951 in the regular ML. *WR* not found. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular\nML. *Leaves of Grass* (94) was on the first list of titles scheduled for\nMLCE. Kouwenhoven indicated that the ML needed a thoroughly revised\nvolume of Whitman’s writings when Stein invited him to write a new\nintroduction for the College Edition. Stein agreed and offered him a\nflat fee of $250 to select and edit the text and write the introduction,\nnoting that the new edition would assure the ML of “a book considerably\nmore desirable than that offered by any competitors, not only in terms\nof quantity of material but in terms of the more complete picture it\ngives of Whitman himself” (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 25 January 1950; 5\nApril 1950; 10 April 1950). Stein sent Kouwenhoven an additional $100\nwhen *Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose* was added to the regular ML\n(Stein to Kouwenhoven, 28 June 1951).\n\nThe 94.2 jacket with its outdated flap reference to Carl Sandburg’s\nintroduction remained in use through 1953. The flap text was revised in\nspring 1954. ML catalogs began to list the title as *Leaves of Grass and\nSelected Prose* in spring 1954; ML lists inside the jackets and at the\nend of ML volumes continued to list it as *Leaves of Grass*.\n\nWhitman’s *Leaves of Grass* was one of four works that were published in\nthe regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included\nin all three series were Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (1930: 197), Giant\n(1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*\n(1929: 171), Giant (1937: G34), Illus ML (1943: IML 2); Fielding,\n*History of Tom Jones* (1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943:\nIML 5).\n\n#### 440b.
