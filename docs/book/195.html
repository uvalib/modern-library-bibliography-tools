<p><strong>JOHN DEWEY. HUMAN NATURE AND CONDUCT. 1930–1986. (ML 173)</strong></p>

(<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1922. ML edition (195.1a<sub>1</sub>, pp. [iii]–vii, 14–336) printed from corrected Holt plates with the introduction (pp. 1–13) omitted; 195.1a<sub>2</sub> and subsequent printings of 195.1 are printed from the same plates and include the introduction. Published April 1930. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.</p>
<p>Cerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an advance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot Holt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a college text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E. Holt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when Herschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a reorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince the new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John Dewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a copy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first payment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that over for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13 February 1928).</p>
<p>By 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told Cerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an introduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and suggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to <em>The Dance of Life</em> (1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to write the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey to Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to the ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense. Dewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library Edition” since <em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> already included a preface and an introduction by Dewey.</p>
<p>Someone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his introduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was paginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part of the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the mistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the last page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on its verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing. In its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8 leaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all remaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first printing. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of the contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and the first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of the second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected copies became the first state of the first printing.</p>
<p>There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine printings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A printing of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper rationing.</p>
<p><em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It ranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period November 1952–October 1953.</p>

<p>Front flap: <br> The dean of American philosophy gives here the fruit of his lifelong researches in the dynamic interaction between human nature and the social environment. His thesis is the continuity of nature, man and society. Upon this conception he argues for a free and realistic morality and interprets individual and social psychology. The conclusions drawn by Professor Dewey provide a set of values to which the modern mind can subscribe with the fullest accord. <em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> is an essential contribution to a better understanding of social relations.

(*Spring 1930*)  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)  \n\nOriginally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1922. ML edition (195.1a<sub>1</sub>, pp. [iii]–vii, 14–336) printed from corrected Holt plates with the introduction (pp. 1–13) omitted; 195.1a<sub>2</sub> and subsequent printings of 195.1 are printed from the same plates and include the introduction. Published April 1930. *WR* not found. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.  \n\nCerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an advance of \\$560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot Holt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a college text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E. Holt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when Herschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a reorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince the new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John Dewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a copy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first payment of \\$750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that over for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13 February 1928).  \n\nBy 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told Cerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an introduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of \\$100 and suggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to *The Dance of Life* (1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to write the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey to Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to the ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense. Dewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library Edition” since *Human Nature and Conduct* already included a preface and an introduction by Dewey.  \n\nSomeone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his introduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was paginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part of the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the mistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the last page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on its verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing. In its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8 leaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all remaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first printing. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of the contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and the first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of the second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected copies became the first state of the first printing.  \n\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine printings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A printing of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper rationing.  \n\n*Human Nature and Conduct* was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It ranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period November 1952–October 1953.  \n\n#### 195.1a<sub>2</sub>.

His thesis is the continuity of nature, man and society. Upon this conception he argues for a free and realistic morality and interprets individual and social psychology. The conclusions drawn by Professor Dewey provide a set of values to which the modern mind can subscribe with the fullest accord. *Human Nature and Conduct* is an essential contribution to a better understanding of social relations.
