(<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1922. ML edition
(195.1a<sub>1</sub>, pp. [iii]–vii, 14–336) printed from corrected
Holt plates with the introduction (pp. 1–13) omitted; 195.1a<sub>2</sub>
and subsequent printings of 195.1 are printed from the same plates and
include the introduction. Published April 1930. <em>WR</em> not found. First
printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.</p>
<p>Cerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an
advance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot
Holt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a
college text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E.
Holt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when
Herschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a
reorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince
the new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John
Dewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a
copy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first
payment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that
over for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13
February 1928).</p>
<p>By 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told
Cerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to
Cerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an
introduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and
suggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to <em>The Dance of Life</em>
(1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to
write the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey
to Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to
the ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense.
Dewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library
Edition” since <em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> already included a preface and
an introduction by Dewey.</p>
<p>Someone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his
introduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was
paginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part
of the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the
mistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the
last page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on
its verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing.
In its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8
leaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all
remaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first
printing. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of
the contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and
the first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of
the second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected
copies became the first state of the first printing.</p>
<p>There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third
printing of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine
printings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A
printing of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper
rationing.</p>
<p><em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> was low in the third quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It
ranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period
November 1952–October 1953.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The dean of American philosophy gives here the fruit of his lifelong
researches in the dynamic interaction between human nature and the
social environment. His thesis is the continuity of nature, man and
society. Upon this conception he argues for a free and realistic
morality and interprets individual and social psychology. The
conclusions drawn by Professor Dewey provide a set of values to which
the modern mind can subscribe with the fullest accord. <em>Human Nature
and Conduct</em> is an essential contribution to a better understanding of
social relations. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

(*Spring 1930*)\n\nOriginally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1922. ML edition\n(195.1a<sub>1</sub>, pp. \\[iii\\]–vii, 14–336) printed from corrected\nHolt plates with the introduction (pp. 1–13) omitted; 195.1a<sub>2</sub>\nand subsequent printings of 195.1 are printed from the same plates and\ninclude the introduction. Published April 1930. *WR* not found. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.\n\nCerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an\nadvance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot\nHolt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a\ncollege text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E.\nHolt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when\nHerschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a\nreorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince\nthe new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John\nDewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a\ncopy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first\npayment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that\nover for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13\nFebruary 1928).\n\nBy 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told\nCerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to\nCerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and\nsuggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to *The Dance of Life*\n(1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to\nwrite the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey\nto Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to\nthe ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense.\nDewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library\nEdition” since *Human Nature and Conduct* already included a preface and\nan introduction by Dewey.\n\nSomeone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his\nintroduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was\npaginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part\nof the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the\nmistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the\nlast page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on\nits verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing.\nIn its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8\nleaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all\nremaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first\nprinting. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of\nthe contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and\nthe first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of\nthe second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected\ncopies became the first state of the first printing.\n\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third\nprinting of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine\nprintings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A\nprinting of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper\nrationing.\n\n*Human Nature and Conduct* was low in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It\nranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period\nNovember 1952–October 1953.\n\n**195.1a**<sub>2</sub>**.
