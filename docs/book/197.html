<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> The great French critic Sainte-Beuve called <em>Don Quixote</em> “the Bible of Humanity.” For more than three and a quarter centuries it has maintained its position as the most eagerly read novel in any language. Its appeal is universal; scholars still discover a wealth of new meanings in it and general readers find constantly fresh enjoyment. The Modern Library edition, complete and unabridged, is Ozell’s revision of the translation of Peter Motteux. Herschel Brickell contributes a glowing introduction, with a biographical sketch of the creator of “one of the most impressive memorials to the spirit of man.” (<em>Spring 1941</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in very light green (143), strong orange (50), light brown (57), light brownish gray (60) and black on coated white paper with ink-and-wash drawing of a mounted Don Quixote holding a lance with Sancho Panza following behind him on a donkey; lettering in black, all against very light green background; spine lettering (author, title, translator) in black on inset strong orange panel. Designed by Warren Chappell; unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> This translation by Samuel Putnam—which has been greeted as a literary event of the first magnitude—captures for the first time in English the glory and the humor, the meaning and the feeling of the original. <em>Don Quixote</em>, the first modern novel, has for three and a half centuries maintained its place in the affections of every generation of readers. Its appeal is universal and inexhaustible—it has been called “the Bible of Humility” by the renowned French critic Saint-Beuve.
The Samuel Putnam translation is now available, complete and unabridged, in this handsomely printed one–volume edition, with a critical text based upon the first editions of 1605 and 1615, and with variant readings, variorum notes, and an Introduction by the translator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putnam translation originally published in two volumes by Viking Press, 1949. ML edition (pp. [v]–1043) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published fall 1964. <em>WR</em> 2 November 1964. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The Putnam translation replaced Ozell’s revision of the Peter Motteux translation in MLG in spring 1965. The offset plates for the Giant are also photographically reduced from the Viking edition, but the larger format of the Giant made possible a smaller reduction and resulted in a far more readable book. The reduction in the text page of 197.2 is about 18 percent as opposed to about 8 percent for the Giant (G14.2).</p>

Its appeal is universal; scholars still discover a wealth of new meanings in it and general readers find constantly fresh enjoyment. The Modern Library edition, complete and unabridged, is Ozell’s revision of the translation of Peter Motteux. Herschel Brickell contributes a glowing introduction, with a biographical sketch of the creator of “one of the most impressive memorials to the spirit of man.” (*Spring 1941*)  \n\n#### 197.1c.

(*Fall 1964*) *Note:* Fall 1964 ML lists retained in subsequent printings.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in very light green (143), strong orange (50), light brown (57), light brownish gray (60) and black on coated white paper with ink-and-wash drawing of a mounted Don Quixote holding a lance with Sancho Panza following behind him on a donkey; lettering in black, all against very light green background; spine lettering (author, title, translator) in black on inset strong orange panel. Designed by Warren Chappell; unsigned.  \n\n> Front flap: <br> This translation by Samuel Putnam—which has been greeted as a literary event of the first magnitude—captures for the first time in English the glory and the humor, the meaning and the feeling of the original. *Don Quixote*, the first modern novel, has for three and a half centuries maintained its place in the affections of every generation of readers. Its appeal is universal and inexhaustible—it has been called “the Bible of Humility” by the renowned French critic Saint-Beuve. \nThe Samuel Putnam translation is now available, complete and unabridged, in this handsomely printed one–volume edition, with a critical text based upon the first editions of 1605 and 1615, and with variant readings, variorum notes, and an Introduction by the translator.  \n\nPutnam translation originally published in two volumes by Viking Press, 1949. ML edition (pp. [v]–1043) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published fall 1964. *WR* 2 November 1964. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nThe Putnam translation replaced Ozell’s revision of the Peter Motteux translation in MLG in spring 1965. The offset plates for the Giant are also photographically reduced from the Viking edition, but the larger format of the Giant made possible a smaller reduction and resulted in a far more readable book. The reduction in the text page of 197.2 is about 18 percent as opposed to about 8 percent for the Giant (G14.2).  \n\n#### 197.2b.
