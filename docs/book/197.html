<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The great French critic Sainte-Beuve called <em>Don Quixote</em> “the Bible
of Humanity.” For more than three and a quarter centuries it has
maintained its position as the most eagerly read novel in any
language. Its appeal is universal; scholars still discover a wealth of
new meanings in it and general readers find constantly fresh
enjoyment. The Modern Library edition, complete and unabridged, is
Ozell’s revision of the translation of Peter Motteux. Herschel
Brickell contributes a glowing introduction, with a biographical
sketch of the creator of “one of the most impressive memorials to the
spirit of man.” (<em>Spring 1941</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in very light green (143), strong orange (50), light
brown (57), light brownish gray (60) and black on coated white paper
with ink-and-wash drawing of a mounted Don Quixote holding a lance with
Sancho Panza following behind him on a donkey; lettering in black, all

Chappell; unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This translation by Samuel Putnam—which has been greeted as a literary
event of the first magnitude—captures for the first time in English
the glory and the humor, the meaning and the feeling of the original.
<em>Don Quixote</em>, the first modern novel, has for three and a half
centuries maintained its place in the affections of every generation
of readers. Its appeal is universal and inexhaustible—it has been
called “the Bible of Humility” by the renowned French critic
Saint-Beuve.</p>
<p>The Samuel Putnam translation is now available, complete and
unabridged, in this handsomely printed one–volume edition, with a
critical text based upon the first editions of 1605 and 1615, and with
variant readings, variorum notes, and an Introduction by the
translator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putnam translation originally published in two volumes by Viking Press,
1949. ML edition (pp. [v]–1043) printed from offset plates
photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published fall 1964.
<em>WR</em> 2 November 1964. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>The Putnam translation replaced Ozell’s revision of the Peter Motteux
translation in MLG in spring 1965. The offset plates for the Giant are
also photographically reduced from the Viking edition, but the larger
format of the Giant made possible a smaller reduction and resulted in a
far more readable book. The reduction in the text page of 197.2 is about
18 percent as opposed to about 8 percent for the Giant (G14.2).</p>
