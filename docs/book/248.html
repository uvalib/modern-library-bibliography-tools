<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in brownish orange (54) and black on pale orange
yellow (73) paper depicting three soldiers learning against a ship’s
rail with black sea in background; borders in brownish orange, lettering
in black. Signed: W.C. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The years that have passed since the World War have been severe to the
literature of that disastrous episode in human history. Only a few
books have survived. Of these, <em>Three Soldiers</em> stands pre-eminent. It
reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the
experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture
in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. <em>Three
Soldiers</em> introduced a writer who has since become a major figure
among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests
securely. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed
from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates
appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled
for November 1932. <em>WR</em> 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies.
Discontinued 1963.</p>
<p>Eight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday,
Doran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern
Library, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and
Three Soldiers.” He asked how many copies <em>Three Soldiers</em> had sold in
the trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial
Library (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that
the plates for <em>Three Soldiers</em> were too large for the ML’s format he
contacted Harper &amp; Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s
<em>Manhattan Transfer</em> and <em>The 42nd Parallel</em>. <em>Manhattan Transfer</em> had
sold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for <em>The 42nd Parallel</em> (Henry
Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those
titles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin
with <em>Three Soldiers</em> and added <em>The 42nd Parallel</em> (307) to the ML five
years later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos
Passos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.</p>
<p>For <em>Three Soldiers</em> the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250
against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his
corrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know
if I made more corrections in the <em>Three Soldiers</em> text than you can
handle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were
just going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was
away when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked
Cerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling
corrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.
The introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was
doing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,
undated).</p>
<p><em>Three Soldiers</em> sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant
titles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from
Doubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500
copies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20
August 1946). <em>Three Soldiers</em> did not rank among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>Houghton Mifflin withdrew <em>Three Soldiers</em> and Dos Passos’s <em>U.S.A.</em>
(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality
paperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination
agreement in June and instructed the production department to make no
more printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June
1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock
and asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to
bring out <em>Three Soldiers</em> until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick
Moseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated
that the ML had 3,000 copies of <em>Three Soldiers</em>, enough to last about a
year, and a six- to eight-month supply of <em>U.S.A.</em> (Klopfer to Moseley,
22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if
<em>Three Soldiers</em> was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was
(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January
1964). <em>Three Soldiers</em> was published in Sentry Editions later that
year.</p>
<p><em>Three Soldiers</em> was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after
fall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the
end of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to <em>The
Buddhist Tradition</em>, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring
1969 after the oversight was discovered.</p>

Upon this first book his reputation rests\n> securely. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed\nfrom Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates\nappear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled\nfor November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1963.\n\nEight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday,\nDoran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern\nLibrary, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and\nThree Soldiers.” He asked how many copies *Three Soldiers* had sold in\nthe trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial\nLibrary (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that\nthe plates for *Three Soldiers* were too large for the ML’s format he\ncontacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer* and *The 42nd Parallel*. *Manhattan Transfer* had\nsold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for *The 42nd Parallel* (Henry\nHoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those\ntitles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin\nwith *Three Soldiers* and added *The 42nd Parallel* (307) to the ML five\nyears later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos\nPassos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.\n\nFor *Three Soldiers* the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his\ncorrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know\nif I made more corrections in the *Three Soldiers* text than you can\nhandle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were\njust going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was\naway when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked\nCerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling\ncorrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.\nThe introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was\ndoing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,\nundated).\n\n*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from\nDoubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500\ncopies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20\nAugust 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\nHoughton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.*\n(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality\npaperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination\nagreement in June and instructed the production department to make no\nmore printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June\n1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock\nand asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to\nbring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick\nMoseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated\nthat the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a\nyear, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley,\n22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if\n*Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was\n(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January\n1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that\nyear.\n\n*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after\nfall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the\nend of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The\nBuddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring\n1969 after the oversight was discovered.\n\n#### 248b.

The text is in awful shape as I was\naway when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked\nCerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling\ncorrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.\nThe introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was\ndoing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,\nundated).\n\n*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from\nDoubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500\ncopies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20\nAugust 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\nHoughton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.*\n(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality\npaperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination\nagreement in June and instructed the production department to make no\nmore printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June\n1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock\nand asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to\nbring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick\nMoseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated\nthat the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a\nyear, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley,\n22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if\n*Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was\n(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January\n1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that\nyear.\n\n*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after\nfall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the\nend of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The\nBuddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring\n1969 after the oversight was discovered.\n\n"
