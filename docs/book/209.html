<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For more than five centuries Giovanni Boccaccio’s <em>The Decameron</em> has
stood virtually unchallenged in its supremacy as the world’s greatest
collection of tales. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Keats and many other
literary immortals found in these Florentine stories a never-failing
inspiration and a veritable source book for plot material. To the
modern reader, <em>The Decameron</em> affords undiminished stimulation and
pleasure, despite the strictures and the vain attempts at suppression
by hysterical censors. Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the
best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Payne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February
1931. <em>WR</em> 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded
1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that <em>The Decameron</em>
would not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of
occasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury
Department did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its
importation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A.
Falk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who
indicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include
shocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).</p>
<p>The ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to
John S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of
Vice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of <em>The
Decameron</em>, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American
universities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He
stated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p.
xxii).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously,
but Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed
foreword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our
friend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I
rather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors,
might shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27
December 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the
title page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees.
Cerf assured booksellers in an article in <em>PW</em> that the Payne
translation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying
the sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of
public morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” <em>PW</em>
119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).</p>
<p>Sumner did not challenge the ML edition, but <em>The Decameron</em> remained a
controversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who
specialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML
jacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any
title at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the
DROLL STORIES” (Wilcox &amp; Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales
representative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of
titles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked
Lewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised:
“Leave out Faulkner &amp; Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern
maidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a
stink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).</p>
<p><em>The Decameron</em> was the best-selling ML title during the first six
months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies
during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the
first quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position
in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower
than in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.</p>

<p>The ML began to consider a new translation of <em>The Decameron</em> in 1953
when Barry Ulanov of Barnard College submitted a six-page sample
translation. Stein sent Ulanov’s sample to a number of readers but the
response was generally unfavorable. Several readers suggested Frances
Winwar’s translation as the best available. Stein wrote Winwar in
December to express interest in using her translation (Stein to Winwar,
22 December 1953). She subsequently sent ten pages of revisions that
were incorporated into the ML edition.</p>

To the\n> modern reader, *The Decameron* affords undiminished stimulation and\n> pleasure, despite the strictures and the vain attempts at suppression\n> by hysterical censors. Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the\n> best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (*Fall 1939*)\n\nPayne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February\n1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded\n1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).\n\nCerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that *The Decameron*\nwould not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of\noccasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its\nimportation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A.\nFalk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who\nindicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include\nshocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).\n\nThe ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to\nJohn S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of\nVice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of *The\nDecameron*, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American\nuniversities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He\nstated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p.\nxxii).\n\nCerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously,\nbut Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed\nforeword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our\nfriend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I\nrather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors,\nmight shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27\nDecember 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the\ntitle page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees.\nCerf assured booksellers in an article in *PW* that the Payne\ntranslation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying\nthe sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of\npublic morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW*\n119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).\n\nSumner did not challenge the ML edition, but *The Decameron* remained a\ncontroversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who\nspecialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML\njacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any\ntitle at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the\nDROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales\nrepresentative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of\ntitles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked\nLewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised:\n“Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern\nmaidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a\nstink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).\n\n*The Decameron* was the best-selling ML title during the first six\nmonths of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nfirst quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position\nin the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower\nthan in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 209.1b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nTHE | DECAMERON | OF | GIOVANNI | BOCCACCIO | TRANSLATED BY | JOHN PAYNE\n| \\[torchbearer D3 at right; 3-line imprint at left\\] THE | MODERN\nLIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xxii, \\[1–2\\] 3–830 \\[831–842\\]. \\[1–27\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 209.1a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] publication and\nmanufacturing statements within single rules; \\[831–836\\] ML list;\n\\[837–838\\] ML Giants list; \\[839–842\\] blank.

Stein sent Ulanov’s sample to a number of readers but the\nresponse was generally unfavorable. Several readers suggested Frances\nWinwar’s translation as the best available.
