<p><strong>LUDWIG LEWISOHN. THE ISLAND WITHIN. 1940–1942. (ML 123)</strong></p>
<h4>329. First printing (1940)</h4>
<p>THE ISLAND | WITHIN | BY | LUDWIG LEWISOHN | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/D1.webp'>torchbearer D1</uvalib-modal-image-button> at right; 3-line imprint at left] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | [rule]</p>
<p>Pp. [<em>4</em>], [1–2] 3–350 [351–362]. [1]<sup>16</sup> (–3) [2–11]<sup>16</sup> [12]<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>[<em>1</em>] half title; [<em>2</em>] blank; [<em>3</em>] title; [<em>4</em>] COPYRIGHT, 1928, BY HARPER &amp; BROTHERS | FIRST <em>Modern Library</em> EDITION, 1940; [1] part title: <em><span class="smallcaps">Book One</span></em>; [2] dedication; 3–350 text; [351–355] ML list; [356–357] ML Giants list; [358–362] blank. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in dark grayish red (20) and dark gray (266) on cream paper; background in dark grayish red, title and author in dark gray on inset cream panel, series and torchbearer below panel in reverse against dark grayish red background; backstrip in dark grayish red with torchbearer and lettering in reverse except title in gray on inset cream panel. Designed by Joseph Blumenthal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The appeal to conscience and the lyrical quality of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writing make <em>The Island Within</em> his most notable novel. In it he recounts the age-old plight of the man of integrity who must struggle alone against the evil forces of prejudice and reaction. With an unerring insight into the Jewish spirit, Mr. Lewisohn reveals the nobility of a people reflected by one of its sons in the modern world. The story he tells is rich in imagery and immensely rewarding to the reader who demands fiction with meaning and emotion. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1928. ML edition (pp. [1]–350) printed from Harper plates. Published April 1940. <em>WR</em> 6 April 1940. First and only printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1942.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. Lewisohn repeatedly urged Cerf to add <em>The Island Within</em> to the ML although two of his books, <em>Up Stream</em> (128) and <em>The Story of American Literature</em> (G43), were already in the series. Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place. Lewisohn approved of this step with all the vociferousness at his command, which, I need scarcely tell you, is quelquechose [<em>sic</em>]” (Cerf to Canfield, Harper &amp; Bros., 12 October 1939).</p>
<p><em>The Island Within</em> was discontinued after two and a half years because of poor sales. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.</p>

Designed by Joseph Blumenthal.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The appeal to conscience and the lyrical quality of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writing make *The Island Within* his most notable novel. In it he recounts the age-old plight of the man of integrity who must struggle alone against the evil forces of prejudice and reaction. With an unerring insight into the Jewish spirit, Mr. Lewisohn reveals the nobility of a people reflected by one of its sons in the modern world. The story he tells is rich in imagery and immensely rewarding to the reader who demands fiction with meaning and emotion. (*Spring 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Brothers, 1928. ML edition (pp. [1]–350) printed from Harper plates. Published April 1940. *WR* 6 April 1940. First and only printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1942.  \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s a \\$400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. Lewisohn repeatedly urged Cerf to add *The Island Within* to the ML although two of his books, *Up Stream* (128) and *The Story of American Literature* (G43), were already in the series. Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place. Lewisohn approved of this step with all the vociferousness at his command, which, I need scarcely tell you, is quelquechose [*sic*]” (Cerf to Canfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939).  \n\n*The Island Within* was discontinued after two and a half years because of poor sales. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nLewisohn, ed., *Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75  \nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (1926–1939) 128  \nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43  \n\n",

(*Spring 1940*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in dark grayish red (20) and dark gray (266) on cream paper; background in dark grayish red, title and author in dark gray on inset cream panel, series and torchbearer below panel in reverse against dark grayish red background; backstrip in dark grayish red with torchbearer and lettering in reverse except title in gray on inset cream panel. Designed by Joseph Blumenthal.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The appeal to conscience and the lyrical quality of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writing make *The Island Within* his most notable novel. In it he recounts the age-old plight of the man of integrity who must struggle alone against the evil forces of prejudice and reaction. With an unerring insight into the Jewish spirit, Mr. Lewisohn reveals the nobility of a people reflected by one of its sons in the modern world. The story he tells is rich in imagery and immensely rewarding to the reader who demands fiction with meaning and emotion. (*Spring 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Brothers, 1928. ML edition (pp. [1]–350) printed from Harper plates. Published April 1940. *WR* 6 April 1940. First and only printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1942.  \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s a \\$400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. Lewisohn repeatedly urged Cerf to add *The Island Within* to the ML although two of his books, *Up Stream* (128) and *The Story of American Literature* (G43), were already in the series. Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place. Lewisohn approved of this step with all the vociferousness at his command, which, I need scarcely tell you, is quelquechose [*sic*]” (Cerf to Canfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939).  \n\n*The Island Within* was discontinued after two and a half years because of poor sales. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nLewisohn, ed., *Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75  \nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (1926–1939) 128  \nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43  \n\n"
