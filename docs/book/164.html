<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>  John Addington Symond’s [<em>sic</em>] biography is more than a study of a unique personality; it is an incarnation of the Renaissance and an evaluation of its most titanic symbol. In the ninety years of Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a century was consecrated to a burning sense of beauty, which took form in his colossal plastic figures and the impassioned sonnets. The versatile creator of the Sistine chapel, sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and writer completely embodies the Carlyle-Nietzschean conception of “the  hero as artist.” (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1893, in 2 volumes. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published October 1928. <em>WR</em> 3 November 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The <em>PW</em> advertisement announcing the publication of <em>The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti</em> noted that the ML edition was “1/8 the price of other editions!” (<em>PW</em>, 4 August 1928, p. 368).</p>
<p><em>The Life of Michelangelo</em> ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>  Even more than a study of one of the most heroic personalities of  history, John Addington Symond’s [<em>sic</em>] biography of Michelangelo becomes an evaluation of the Renaissance and its most titanic symbol.  Of the ninety years of Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a  century was consecrated to his great works of art. The unexcelled  sculptured figures and the impassioned sonnets suggest two facets of  his complex creative personality. The painter of the Sistine Chapel, the sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and the writer  indicate the versatility of his gifts and the richness of the heritage he has bestowed upon mankind. (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>
