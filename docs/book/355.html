<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Among philosophers Santayana has earned the tribute of being
considered the dramatist of ideas. His many-faceted wisdom, the vast
range of his intellectual curiosity and the graceful flow of his style
explain why he is one of the most widely read poet–philosophers of
modern times. The best and most characteristic of Santayana’s writings
in prose and verse are assembled in this volume of 650 pages. Irwin
Edman, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, who is
responsible for the selection, contributes a brilliant Introductory
Essay. (<em>Spring 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published with Edman’s introductory essay by Charles
Scribner’s Sons, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Publication announced for November 1942 but published in
September. <em>WR</em> 26 September 1942. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1952.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in <em>The Philosophy of Santayana</em> in 1939, but
Scribner’s does not appear to have been ready to authorize an
inexpensive reprint (Whitney Darrow to Cerf, 17 July 1939). Three years
later the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of $1,000 against royalties of 5
cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased
to 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available
and in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format.
Scribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to
recover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman
edited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional
payment for the ML edition.</p>
<p>The suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came
initially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had edited <em>The Philosophy
of William James</em> (119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former
student of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James
volume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar
collection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the
volume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was
interested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than $250
(Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926). Cerf told him to go ahead, then wrote
three months later to cancel the project, noting that he wanted the book
but was afraid that Scribner’s would not give the necessary permissions
(Cerf to Kallen, 29 November 1926; Cerf to Kallen, 3 March 1927). That
summer Cerf indicated to Joseph Ratner, who had written on Santayana’s
behalf to inquire about progress on the project, that the collection was
out of the question for the time being because of the large number of
permissions that would have to be secured from Scribner’s. “We are
convinced that just as soon as we approached them on the subject they
would turn us down and proceed on such an anthology on their own . . .”
(Ratner to Cerf, 8 June 1927; Cerf to Ratner, 11 August 1927).
Scribner’s published <em>The Philosophy of Santayana</em> in 1939.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,405 copies by 1 November 1943. Scribner’s
published a new and greatly enlarged edition of <em>The Philosophy of
Santayana</em> in 1953 and may have terminated the ML’s reprint contract in
anticipation of the appearance of that edition.</p>

The best and most characteristic of Santayana’s writings\n> in prose and verse are assembled in this volume of 650 pages. Irwin\n> Edman, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, who is\n> responsible for the selection, contributes a brilliant Introductory\n> Essay. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published with Edman’s introductory essay by Charles\nScribner’s Sons, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Publication announced for November 1942 but published in\nSeptember. *WR* 26 September 1942. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1952.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939, but\nScribner’s does not appear to have been ready to authorize an\ninexpensive reprint (Whitney Darrow to Cerf, 17 July 1939). Three years\nlater the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of $1,000 against royalties of 5\ncents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased\nto 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available\nand in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format.\nScribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to\nrecover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman\nedited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional\npayment for the ML edition.\n\nThe suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came\ninitially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had edited *The Philosophy\nof William James* (119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former\nstudent of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James\nvolume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar\ncollection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the\nvolume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was\ninterested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than $250\n(Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926).

Irwin\n> Edman, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, who is\n> responsible for the selection, contributes a brilliant Introductory\n> Essay. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published with Edman’s introductory essay by Charles\nScribner’s Sons, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Publication announced for November 1942 but published in\nSeptember. *WR* 26 September 1942. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1952.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939, but\nScribner’s does not appear to have been ready to authorize an\ninexpensive reprint (Whitney Darrow to Cerf, 17 July 1939). Three years\nlater the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of $1,000 against royalties of 5\ncents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased\nto 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available\nand in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format.\nScribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to\nrecover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman\nedited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional\npayment for the ML edition.\n\nThe suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came\ninitially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had edited *The Philosophy\nof William James* (119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former\nstudent of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James\nvolume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar\ncollection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the\nvolume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was\ninterested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than $250\n(Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926). Cerf told him to go ahead, then wrote\nthree months later to cancel the project, noting that he wanted the book\nbut was afraid that Scribner’s would not give the necessary permissions\n(Cerf to Kallen, 29 November 1926; Cerf to Kallen, 3 March 1927). That\nsummer Cerf indicated to Joseph Ratner, who had written on Santayana’s\nbehalf to inquire about progress on the project, that the collection was\nout of the question for the time being because of the large number of\npermissions that would have to be secured from Scribner’s. “We are\nconvinced that just as soon as we approached them on the subject they\nwould turn us down and proceed on such an anthology on their own . . .”\n(Ratner to Cerf, 8 June 1927; Cerf to Ratner, 11 August 1927).\nScribner’s published *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,405 copies by 1 November 1943.
