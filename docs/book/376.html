<p><strong>ALLAN NEVINS and HENRY STEELE COMMAGER. A SHORT HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. 1945– . (ML 235)</strong></p>
<h4>376.1a. First printing (1945)</h4>
<p>A SHORT | HISTORY OF | THE | UNITED | STATES | <em>by</em> | ALLAN NEVINS | <em>and</em> | HENRY STEELE COMMAGER | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/D2.webp'>torchbearer D2</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | [rule]</p>
<p>Pp. [i–viii] ix–xi [xii–xvi], 1–528. [1–17]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] COPYRIGHT, 1942, BY LITTLE, BROWN AND COMPANY | [2-line rights statement] | COPYRIGHT, 1945, BY RANDOM HOUSE, INC. | FIRST <em>Modern Library</em> EDITION, 1945; [v] poem by Stephen Vincent Benét, “Listen to the People”; [vi] blank; [vii] ACKNOWLEDGMENTS; [viii] blank; ix–xi PREFACE signed p. xi: <span class="smallcaps">Allan Nevins</span> | <span class="smallcaps">Henry Steele Commager</span>; [xii] blank; [xiii] CONTENTS; [xiv] blank; [xv] MAPS; [xvi] blank; 1–511 text; [512] blank; 513–528 INDEX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> As 376.1a except p. [iv] lines 6–12 added: [short swelled rule] | The Modern Library edition of <em>A Short History of the</em> | <em>United States</em> was originally published by Little, Brown | &amp; Company under the title <em>America: The Story of a | Free People</em>. It contains, in addition, a special section, | pages 493 to 511, which brings the history up to the | presidential campaign of 1944. (<em>Fall 1945 jacket</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in deep red (16), grayish olive (110), and black on pale orange yellow (73) paper with decorative illustration of an American eagle; in black and deep red; title in deep red, black, and grayish olive, other lettering in black. Statement at foot of front panel: “With a special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle up to the summer of 1944.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a concise and compact history of our country which would be both authoritative and eminently readable. In the vast literature of the nation’s development no book so completely and comprehensively fulfills these requirements as the work of Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager, both professors of history at Columbia University. They have provided for this edition a special section which brings their chronicle up to the immediate present. (<em>Spring 1945</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published as <em>America: The Story of a Free People</em> by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1942; reprinted in paperback as <em>The Pocket History of the United States</em> (Pocket Books, 1943). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with an added chapter on “The Second World War” (pp. 493–511). Published February 1945. <em>WR</em> 24 February 1945.</p>
<p>Cerf initially expressed interest in adding a concise history of the United States to the ML in 1940. He wrote to Frank Monaghan, an assistant professor of history at Yale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am crazy to have a clear, concise and up-to-the-minute history of the United States in our Modern Library and wonder if you would be interested in discussing with me the possibility of either writing the book yourself or at least collaborating on such a project.
You will be amazed to hear that there is no such book on the market. Thousands of refugees are clamoring for a short history of the country, written without bias and not as a textbook, priced within their reach. In addition, many thousands of native born Americans are more interested in their country today than has ever been the case before (Cerf to Monaghan, 30 October 1940).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monaghan was interested and described the book he envisioned: “It should have the epic sweep and the implications of Beethoven and Wagner, the salt and twang of a Woody Guthrie ballad. . . . It should be better than Green’s <em>Short History of the English People</em>” (Monaghan to Cerf, 24 November 1940). The contract, signed in February 1941, called for the manuscript to be delivered by 1 July 1942. The book was to be published initially as a Random House trade book followed by a ML edition. The contract called for payment of up to $1,500 in expenses; Monaghan would receive royalties for the trade edition at the standard sliding scale of 10% of the list price for the first 2,500 copies, 12½% for the next 2,500 copies, and 15% thereafter. Royalties for the ML edition would be 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p>Cerf reported in May 1941 that the announcement of Monaghan’s book “caused more enthusiasm than any publicity release that was ever sent out from this office” (Cerf to Monaghan, 1 May 1941). In September Monaghan indicated that the book was half written (Monaghan to Cerf, 22 September 1941). Monaghan received an additional advance of $500 in September 1942, but he had many other ongoing projects and the book was never completed.</p>
<p>Cerf’s last letter to Monaghan was dated 2 September 1943:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time we discussed the project I remember begging you not to take it on unless you were absolutely sure you could deliver. I impressed upon you the fact that if you couldn’t do the book in time, we would attempt to find somebody else who would.
Obviously I made a colossal mistake in judgment when I entrusted this book to you. Had you turned out nothing else since the time you signed the contract, I could have understood your failure to live up to your promise, but I have seen not only your work on Old New York, but that lengthy manuscript on the History of the World that you brought us yourself and that was obviously done on the time that you should have spent finishing the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.
It seems to me that the least that you could have done was to tell us that you couldn’t do the job as soon as you decided on taking up your other work, thus giving us the opportunity of finding somebody else to do what we wanted before other publishers beat us to the draw.
I simply cannot understand dealings of this sort (Cerf to Monaghan, 2 September 1943).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly before Cerf wrote his final letter to Monaghan, Klopfer, who was serving in the U.S. Air Force, wrote to Cerf suggesting “a small illustrated book of the documents of democracy and our own history.” He noted that either Allan Nevins or Henry Steele Commager would do a fine job editing the volume (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, in Cerf and Klopfer, <em>Dear Donald, Dear Bennett</em>, p. 87).</p>
<p>The following month Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of Nevins and Commager’s history, titled <em>America: The Story of a Free People</em> in its original edition and <em>The Pocket History of the United States</em> in the paperback reprint (Pocket Books, February 1943). Cerf referred to it in <em>Saturday Review of Literature</em> as “the best short ‘History of the United States’ on the market” and noted that the Pocket Books edition had sold half a million copies (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, 14 August 1943, p. 14).</p>
<p>Cerf offered Little, Brown a $2,500 advance for a ML edition, but Alfred McIntyre, the president of Little, Brown, indicated that it was selling too well for a ML edition to be considered. In any case, he added, Pocket Books controlled all rights to editions selling for less than two dollars (Cerf to McIntyre, Little, Brown &amp; Co., 17 September 1943; McIntyre to Cerf, 20 September 1943). Cerf’s next step was to offer Pocket Books a $4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised to do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to Commager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months for everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an introduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer indicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and royalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962).</p>
<p>Successive ML editions of <em>A Short History of the United States</em> sold over 100,000 copies prior to 1969. It sold 3,685 copies during November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles during this 12-month period.</p>
<h4>376.1b. Chapter on Second World War revised and reset (1951)</h4>
<p>Title as 376.1a.</p>
<p>Pp. [<em>2</em>], [i–viii] ix–xi [xii–xvi], [<em>2</em>], 1–552 [553–556]. [1–18]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Contents as 376.1a variant except: [<em>1</em>–<em>2</em>] blank; [iv] <em>First</em> statement omitted; [<em>1</em>] fly title; [<em>2</em>] blank; 1–532 text; 533–552 INDEX; [553–556] blank. <em>Note:</em> The subject matter of the twelve maps remains the same as 376.1a, but all of the maps are redrawn.</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As 376.1a except statement at foot of front panel: “With a special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle up to date.” (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
<p>Chapter 21, “The Second World War,” was substantially revised and completely reset. It was 21 pages longer than 376.1a. The index, which was also completely reset, increased in length by four pages.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, “The Conquest of New France and the Movement for Independence,” the sentence “The second era had for its most prominent feature the missionary activity of a band of devoted men, representing the Franciscans, the Recollects, the Ursulines, and above all the Jesuits” (376.1a, p. 64, line 19), was changed to “activity of a band of devoted people” (376.1b, p. 64, line 19). The change from “men” to “people” reflected the realization that the Ursulines were a teaching order of nuns.</p>
<p>A revised Pocket Books edition containing the new chapter on the Second World War and additional revisions not in ML 376.1b was published in February 1951, but it retained the reading “a band of devoted men” (Pocket Books, rev. ed., 1951, p. 59).</p>
<p>The “new enlarged edition” (376.2) published in the ML in 1956 was photographically reproduced from the 1956 Pocket Books edition and reverts to the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.2, p. 59). The 5th edition of <em>A Short History of the United States</em> (Knopf, 1966), which was reprinted in the ML in 1969, also retains the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.3, p. 63).</p>

(<em>Spring/fall 1958</em>) <em>Note:</em> The subject matter of the twelve maps remains the same as 376.1b except “The American Empire” (376.1b, p. 419) is replaced by a new map, “War in Korea” (376.2, p. 532). Once again the maps have all been redrawn.</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> As 376.1a except statement in deep red (16) at foot of front panel: “NEW ENLARGED EDITION.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br> “There is no parallel in modern history,” say the authors in their preface to this book, “to the drama of the swift expansion of a small and feeble people across a continent, the growth of a few straggling colonies into the most powerful of nations.”
It is this story of a people passionately dedicated to the ideals of democracy that is here told in compact and eminently readable form. The authors, both professors of history at Columbia University, are among the most distinguished historians of our time and this book reflects throughout their authoritative knowledge and perspectives. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

(Pocket Books, 1956), with the fly title (p. [<em>1</em>]) revised from “A POCKET HISTORY | OF THE | UNITED STATES” to “A SHORT HISTORY | OF THE | UNITED STATES.”</p>

It contains, in addition, a special section, | pages 493 to 511, which brings the history up to the | presidential campaign of 1944. (*Fall 1945 jacket*) \n\n*Jacket A:* Pictorial in deep red (16), grayish olive (110), and black on pale orange yellow (73) paper with decorative illustration of an American eagle; in black and deep red; title in deep red, black, and grayish olive, other lettering in black. Statement at foot of front panel: “With a special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle up to the summer of 1944.” \n\n> Front flap:<br> For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a concise and compact history of our country which would be both authoritative and eminently readable. In the vast literature of the nation’s development no book so completely and comprehensively fulfills these requirements as the work of Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager, both professors of history at Columbia University. They have provided for this edition a special section which brings their chronicle up to the immediate present. (*Spring 1945*) \n\nOriginally published as *America: The Story of a Free People* by Little, Brown & Co., 1942; reprinted in paperback as *The Pocket History of the United States* (Pocket Books, 1943). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with an added chapter on “The Second World War” (pp. 493–511). Published February 1945. *WR* 24 February 1945. \n\nCerf initially expressed interest in adding a concise history of the United States to the ML in 1940. He wrote to Frank Monaghan, an assistant professor of history at Yale: \n\n> I am crazy to have a clear, concise and up-to-the-minute history of the United States in our Modern Library and wonder if you would be interested in discussing with me the possibility of either writing the book yourself or at least collaborating on such a project. \n> You will be amazed to hear that there is no such book on the market. Thousands of refugees are clamoring for a short history of the country, written without bias and not as a textbook, priced within their reach. In addition, many thousands of native born Americans are more interested in their country today than has ever been the case before (Cerf to Monaghan, 30 October 1940). \n\nMonaghan was interested and described the book he envisioned: “It should have the epic sweep and the implications of Beethoven and Wagner, the salt and twang of a Woody Guthrie ballad. . . . It should be better than Green’s *Short History of the English People*” (Monaghan to Cerf, 24 November 1940). The contract, signed in February 1941, called for the manuscript to be delivered by 1 July 1942. The book was to be published initially as a Random House trade book followed by a ML edition. The contract called for payment of up to \\$1,500 in expenses; Monaghan would receive royalties for the trade edition at the standard sliding scale of 10% of the list price for the first 2,500 copies, 12½% for the next 2,500 copies, and 15% thereafter. Royalties for the ML edition would be 10 cents a copy. \n\nCerf reported in May 1941 that the announcement of Monaghan’s book “caused more enthusiasm than any publicity release that was ever sent out from this office” (Cerf to Monaghan, 1 May 1941). In September Monaghan indicated that the book was half written (Monaghan to Cerf, 22 September 1941). Monaghan received an additional advance of \\$500 in September 1942, but he had many other ongoing projects and the book was never completed. \n\nCerf’s last letter to Monaghan was dated 2 September 1943: \n\n> At the time we discussed the project I remember begging you not to take it on unless you were absolutely sure you could deliver. I impressed upon you the fact that if you couldn’t do the book in time, we would attempt to find somebody else who would. \n> Obviously I made a colossal mistake in judgment when I entrusted this book to you. Had you turned out nothing else since the time you signed the contract, I could have understood your failure to live up to your promise, but I have seen not only your work on Old New York, but that lengthy manuscript on the History of the World that you brought us yourself and that was obviously done on the time that you should have spent finishing the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. \n> It seems to me that the least that you could have done was to tell us that you couldn’t do the job as soon as you decided on taking up your other work, thus giving us the opportunity of finding somebody else to do what we wanted before other publishers beat us to the draw. \n> I simply cannot understand dealings of this sort (Cerf to Monaghan, 2 September 1943). \n\nShortly before Cerf wrote his final letter to Monaghan, Klopfer, who was serving in the U.S. Air Force, wrote to Cerf suggesting “a small illustrated book of the documents of democracy and our own history.” He noted that either Allan Nevins or Henry Steele Commager would do a fine job editing the volume (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p. 87). \n\nThe following month Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of Nevins and Commager’s history, titled *America: The Story of a Free People* in its original edition and *The Pocket History of the United States* in the paperback reprint (Pocket Books, February 1943). Cerf referred to it in *Saturday Review of Literature* as “the best short ‘History of the United States’ on the market” and noted that the Pocket Books edition had sold half a million copies (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 14 August 1943, p. 14). \n\nCerf offered Little, Brown a \\$2,500 advance for a ML edition, but Alfred McIntyre, the president of Little, Brown, indicated that it was selling too well for a ML edition to be considered. In any case, he added, Pocket Books controlled all rights to editions selling for less than two dollars (Cerf to McIntyre, Little, Brown & Co., 17 September 1943; McIntyre to Cerf, 20 September 1943). Cerf’s next step was to offer Pocket Books a \\$4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised to do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to Commager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months for everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an introduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer indicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and royalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962). \n\nSuccessive ML editions of *A Short History of the United States* sold over 100,000 copies prior to 1969. It sold 3,685 copies during November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles during this 12-month period. \n\n#### 376.1b. Chapter on Second World War revised and reset (1951) \n\nTitle as 376.1a. \n\nPp. [*2*], [i–viii] ix–xi [xii–xvi], [*2*], 1–552 [553–556]. [1–18]<sup>16</sup> \n\nContents as 376.1a variant except: [*1*–*2*] blank; [iv] *First* statement omitted; [*1*] fly title; [*2*] blank; 1–532 text; 533–552 INDEX; [553–556] blank. *Note:* The subject matter of the twelve maps remains the same as 376.1a, but all of the maps are redrawn. \n\n*Jacket B:* As 376.1a except statement at foot of front panel: “With a special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle up to date.” (*Spring 1951*) \n\nChapter 21, “The Second World War,” was substantially revised and completely reset. It was 21 pages longer than 376.1a. The index, which was also completely reset, increased in length by four pages. \n\nIn Chapter 3, “The Conquest of New France and the Movement for Independence,” the sentence “The second era had for its most prominent feature the missionary activity of a band of devoted men, representing the Franciscans, the Recollects, the Ursulines, and above all the Jesuits” (376.1a, p. 64, line 19), was changed to “activity of a band of devoted people” (376.1b, p. 64, line 19). The change from “men” to “people” reflected the realization that the Ursulines were a teaching order of nuns. \n\nA revised Pocket Books edition containing the new chapter on the Second World War and additional revisions not in ML 376.1b was published in February 1951, but it retained the reading “a band of devoted men” (Pocket Books, rev. ed., 1951, p. 59). \n\nThe “new enlarged edition” (376.2) published in the ML in 1956 was photographically reproduced from the 1956 Pocket Books edition and reverts to the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.2, p. 59). The 5th edition of *A Short History of the United States* (Knopf, 1966), which was reprinted in the ML in 1969, also retains the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.3, p. 63). \n\n#### 376.2.

(*Spring/fall 1958*) *Note:* The subject matter of the twelve maps remains the same as 376.1b except “The American Empire” (376.1b, p. 419) is replaced by a new map, “War in Korea” (376.2, p. 532). Once again the maps have all been redrawn. \n\n*Jacket C:* As 376.1a except statement in deep red (16) at foot of front panel: “NEW ENLARGED EDITION.” \n\n> Front flap revised:<br> “There is no parallel in modern history,” say the authors in their preface to this book, “to the drama of the swift expansion of a small and feeble people across a continent, the growth of a few straggling colonies into the most powerful of nations.” \n> It is this story of a people passionately dedicated to the ideals of democracy that is here told in compact and eminently readable form. The authors, both professors of history at Columbia University, are among the most distinguished historians of our time and this book reflects throughout their authoritative knowledge and perspectives. (*Spring 1958*) \n\nML edition (376.2, pp. [v]–viii [ix‑x], [*2*],1–593) printed from offset plates photographically reproduced and slightly enlarged from *A Pocket History of the United States*, New enl. ed. (Pocket Books, 1956), with the fly title (p. [*1*]) revised from “A POCKET HISTORY | OF THE | UNITED STATES” to “A SHORT HISTORY | OF THE | UNITED STATES.” \n\nThe Pocket Books edition added chapters 22–25 (“The Cold War,” “Postwar Problems, 1946–1952,” “The Korean War: Eisenhower President,” and “The Eisenhower Administration”). It also added a bibliography, an additional map (“War in Korea,” p. 532), and a revised index. All of the additions were retained in ML printings. \n\n#### 376.3.

This new edition has been revised and updated—through the 1964 elections—and twelve maps have been added. \n\n*Jacket D2:* As jacket D1 with SBN 394-60235-8 added at foot of back panel. \n\nFifth edition originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1966. ML edition (pp. [i], v–x, [1]–668, i–xxvi) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Knopf edition with illustrations omitted and the list of maps moved to pp. ix–x in place of the list of illustrations; Suggested Readings at the end of the volume renumbered 652–668. ML edition published November 1969 at \\$2.45. First printing: 6,000 copies. \n\nThe Suggested Readings in the Knopf edition begin on p. 653 and end on p. 669, with blank verso pages following the last page of text and the last page of Suggested Readings.
