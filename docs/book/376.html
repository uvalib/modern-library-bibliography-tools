<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> As 376.1a except p. [iv] lines 6–12 added: [short
swelled rule] | The Modern Library edition of <em>A Short History of
the</em> | <em>United States</em> was originally published by Little, Brown | &amp;
Company under the title <em>America: The Story of a | Free People</em>. It
contains, in addition, a special section, | pages 493 to 511, which
brings the history up to the | presidential campaign of 1944. (<em>Fall
1945 jacket</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in deep red (16), grayish olive (110), and black
on pale orange yellow (73) paper with decorative illustration of an
American eagle; in black and deep red; title in deep red, black, and
grayish olive, other lettering in black. Statement at foot of front
panel: “With a special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle
up to the summer of 1944.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a concise
and compact history of our country which would be both authoritative
and eminently readable. In the vast literature of the nation’s
development no book so completely and comprehensively fulfills these
requirements as the work of Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager,
both professors of history at Columbia University. They have provided
for this edition a special section which brings their chronicle up to
the immediate present. (<em>Spring 1945</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published as <em>America: The Story of a Free People</em> by Little,
Brown &amp; Co., 1942; reprinted in paperback as <em>The Pocket History of the
United States</em> (Pocket Books, 1943). ML edition printed from plates made
from a new typesetting with an added chapter on “The Second World War”
(pp. 493–511). Published February 1945. <em>WR</em> 24 February 1945.</p>
<p>Cerf initially expressed interest in adding a concise history of the
United States to the ML in 1940. He wrote to Frank Monaghan, an
assistant professor of history at Yale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am crazy to have a clear, concise and up-to-the-minute history of
the United States in our Modern Library and wonder if you would be
interested in discussing with me the possibility of either writing the
book yourself or at least collaborating on such a project.</p>
<p>You will be amazed to hear that there is no such book on the market.
Thousands of refugees are clamoring for a short history of the
country, written without bias and not as a textbook, priced within
their reach. In addition, many thousands of native born Americans are
more interested in their country today than has ever been the case
before (Cerf to Monaghan, 30 October 1940).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monaghan was interested and described the book he envisioned: “It should
have the epic sweep and the implications of Beethoven and Wagner, the
salt and twang of a Woody Guthrie ballad. . . . It should be better than
Green’s <em>Short History of the English People</em>” (Monaghan to Cerf, 24
November 1940). The contract, signed in February 1941, called for the
manuscript to be delivered by 1 July 1942. The book was to be published
initially as a Random House trade book followed by a ML edition. The
contract called for payment of up to $1,500 in expenses; Monaghan would
receive royalties for the trade edition at the standard sliding scale of
10% of the list price for the first 2,500 copies, 12½% for the next
2,500 copies, and 15% thereafter. Royalties for the ML edition would be
10 cents a copy.</p>
<p>Cerf reported in May 1941 that the announcement of Monaghan’s book
“caused more enthusiasm than any publicity release that was ever sent
out from this office” (Cerf to Monaghan, 1 May 1941). In September
Monaghan indicated that the book was half written (Monaghan to Cerf, 22
September 1941). Monaghan received an additional advance of $500 in
September 1942, but he had many other ongoing projects and the book was
never completed.</p>
<p>Cerf’s last letter to Monaghan was dated 2 September 1943:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time we discussed the project I remember begging you not to
take it on unless you were absolutely sure you could deliver. I
impressed upon you the fact that if you couldn’t do the book in time,
we would attempt to find somebody else who would.</p>
<p>Obviously I made a colossal mistake in judgment when I entrusted this
book to you. Had you turned out nothing else since the time you signed
the contract, I could have understood your failure to live up to your
promise, but I have seen not only your work on Old New York, but that
lengthy manuscript on the History of the World that you brought us
yourself and that was obviously done on the time that you should have
spent finishing the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the least that you could have done was to tell us
that you couldn’t do the job as soon as you decided on taking up your
other work, thus giving us the opportunity of finding somebody else to
do what we wanted before other publishers beat us to the draw.</p>
<p>I simply cannot understand dealings of this sort (Cerf to Monaghan, 2
September 1943).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly before Cerf wrote his final letter to Monaghan, Klopfer, who was
serving in the U.S. Air Force, wrote to Cerf suggesting “a small
illustrated book of the documents of democracy and our own history.” He
noted that either Allan Nevins or Henry Steele Commager would do a fine
job editing the volume (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, in Cerf and
Klopfer, <em>Dear Donald, Dear Bennett</em>, p. 87).</p>
<p>The following month Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of Nevins
and Commager’s history, titled <em>America: The Story of a Free People</em> in
its original edition and <em>The Pocket History of the United States</em> in
the paperback reprint (Pocket Books, February 1943). Cerf referred to it
in <em>Saturday Review of Literature</em> as “the best short ‘History of the
United States’ on the market” and noted that the Pocket Books edition
had sold half a million copies (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, 14 August 1943, p.
14).</p>
<p>Cerf offered Little, Brown a $2,500 advance for a ML edition, but Alfred
McIntyre, the president of Little, Brown, indicated that it was selling
too well for a ML edition to be considered. In any case, he added,
Pocket Books controlled all rights to editions selling for less than two
dollars (Cerf to McIntyre, Little, Brown &amp; Co., 17 September 1943;
McIntyre to Cerf, 20 September 1943). Cerf’s next step was to offer
Pocket Books a $4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised
to do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to
Commager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months
for everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an
introduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer
indicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and
royalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962).</p>
<p>Successive ML editions of <em>A Short History of the United States</em> sold
over 100,000 copies prior to 1969. It sold 3,685 copies during November
1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles during this 12-month period.</p>
<h4>376.1b. Chapter on Second World War revised and reset (1951)</h4>
<p>Title as 376.1a.</p>
<p>Pp. [<em>2</em>], [i–viii] ix–xi [xii–xvi], [<em>2</em>], 1–552 [553–556].
[1–18]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Contents as 376.1a variant except: [<em>1</em>–<em>2</em>] blank; [iv] <em>First</em>
statement omitted; [<em>1</em>] fly title; [<em>2</em>] blank; 1–532 text; 533–552
INDEX; [553–556] blank. <em>Note:</em> The subject matter of the twelve maps
remains the same as 376.1a, but all of the maps are redrawn.</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As 376.1a except statement at foot of front panel: “With a
special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle up to date.”
(<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
<p>Chapter 21, “The Second World War,” was substantially revised and
completely reset. It was 21 pages longer than 376.1a. The index, which
was also completely reset, increased in length by four pages.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, “The Conquest of New France and the Movement for
Independence,” the sentence “The second era had for its most prominent
feature the missionary activity of a band of devoted men, representing
the Franciscans, the Recollects, the Ursulines, and above all the
Jesuits” (376.1a, p. 64, line 19), was changed to “activity of a band of
devoted people” (376.1b, p. 64, line 19). The change from “men” to
“people” reflected the realization that the Ursulines were a teaching
order of nuns.</p>
<p>A revised Pocket Books edition containing the new chapter on the Second
World War and additional revisions not in ML 376.1b was published in
February 1951, but it retained the reading “a band of devoted men”
(Pocket Books, rev. ed., 1951, p. 59).</p>
<p>The “new enlarged edition” (376.2) published in the ML in 1956 was
photographically reproduced from the 1956 Pocket Books edition and
reverts to the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.2, p. 59). The 5th
edition of <em>A Short History of the United States</em> (Knopf, 1966), which
was reprinted in the ML in 1969, also retains the reading “a band of
devoted men” (376.3, p. 63).</p>

Statement at foot of front\npanel: “With a special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle\nup to the summer of 1944.”\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a concise\n> and compact history of our country which would be both authoritative\n> and eminently readable. In the vast literature of the nation’s\n> development no book so completely and comprehensively fulfills these\n> requirements as the work of Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager,\n> both professors of history at Columbia University. They have provided\n> for this edition a special section which brings their chronicle up to\n> the immediate present. (*Spring 1945*)\n\nOriginally published as *America: The Story of a Free People* by Little,\nBrown & Co., 1942; reprinted in paperback as *The Pocket History of the\nUnited States* (Pocket Books, 1943). ML edition printed from plates made\nfrom a new typesetting with an added chapter on “The Second World War”\n(pp. 493–511). Published February 1945. *WR* 24 February 1945.\n\nCerf initially expressed interest in adding a concise history of the\nUnited States to the ML in 1940. He wrote to Frank Monaghan, an\nassistant professor of history at Yale:\n\n> I am crazy to have a clear, concise and up-to-the-minute history of\n> the United States in our Modern Library and wonder if you would be\n> interested in discussing with me the possibility of either writing the\n> book yourself or at least collaborating on such a project.\n>\n> You will be amazed to hear that there is no such book on the market.\n> Thousands of refugees are clamoring for a short history of the\n> country, written without bias and not as a textbook, priced within\n> their reach. In addition, many thousands of native born Americans are\n> more interested in their country today than has ever been the case\n> before (Cerf to Monaghan, 30 October 1940).\n\nMonaghan was interested and described the book he envisioned: “It should\nhave the epic sweep and the implications of Beethoven and Wagner, the\nsalt and twang of a Woody Guthrie ballad. . . . It should be better than\nGreen’s *Short History of the English People*” (Monaghan to Cerf, 24\nNovember 1940). The contract, signed in February 1941, called for the\nmanuscript to be delivered by 1 July 1942. The book was to be published\ninitially as a Random House trade book followed by a ML edition. The\ncontract called for payment of up to $1,500 in expenses; Monaghan would\nreceive royalties for the trade edition at the standard sliding scale of\n10% of the list price for the first 2,500 copies, 12½% for the next\n2,500 copies, and 15% thereafter. Royalties for the ML edition would be\n10 cents a copy.\n\nCerf reported in May 1941 that the announcement of Monaghan’s book\n“caused more enthusiasm than any publicity release that was ever sent\nout from this office” (Cerf to Monaghan, 1 May 1941). In September\nMonaghan indicated that the book was half written (Monaghan to Cerf, 22\nSeptember 1941). Monaghan received an additional advance of $500 in\nSeptember 1942, but he had many other ongoing projects and the book was\nnever completed.\n\nCerf’s last letter to Monaghan was dated 2 September 1943:\n\n> At the time we discussed the project I remember begging you not to\n> take it on unless you were absolutely sure you could deliver. I\n> impressed upon you the fact that if you couldn’t do the book in time,\n> we would attempt to find somebody else who would.\n>\n> Obviously I made a colossal mistake in judgment when I entrusted this\n> book to you. Had you turned out nothing else since the time you signed\n> the contract, I could have understood your failure to live up to your\n> promise, but I have seen not only your work on Old New York, but that\n> lengthy manuscript on the History of the World that you brought us\n> yourself and that was obviously done on the time that you should have\n> spent finishing the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>\n> It seems to me that the least that you could have done was to tell us\n> that you couldn’t do the job as soon as you decided on taking up your\n> other work, thus giving us the opportunity of finding somebody else to\n> do what we wanted before other publishers beat us to the draw.\n>\n> I simply cannot understand dealings of this sort (Cerf to Monaghan, 2\n> September 1943).\n\nShortly before Cerf wrote his final letter to Monaghan, Klopfer, who was\nserving in the U.S. Air Force, wrote to Cerf suggesting “a small\nillustrated book of the documents of democracy and our own history.” He\nnoted that either Allan Nevins or Henry Steele Commager would do a fine\njob editing the volume (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, in Cerf and\nKlopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p. 87).\n\nThe following month Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of Nevins\nand Commager’s history, titled *America: The Story of a Free People* in\nits original edition and *The Pocket History of the United States* in\nthe paperback reprint (Pocket Books, February 1943). Cerf referred to it\nin *Saturday Review of Literature* as “the best short ‘History of the\nUnited States’ on the market” and noted that the Pocket Books edition\nhad sold half a million copies (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 14 August 1943, p.\n14).\n\nCerf offered Little, Brown a $2,500 advance for a ML edition, but Alfred\nMcIntyre, the president of Little, Brown, indicated that it was selling\ntoo well for a ML edition to be considered. In any case, he added,\nPocket Books controlled all rights to editions selling for less than two\ndollars (Cerf to McIntyre, Little, Brown & Co., 17 September 1943;\nMcIntyre to Cerf, 20 September 1943). Cerf’s next step was to offer\nPocket Books a $4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised\nto do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to\nCommager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months\nfor everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an\nintroduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer\nindicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and\nroyalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962).\n\nSuccessive ML editions of *A Short History of the United States* sold\nover 100,000 copies prior to 1969. It sold 3,685 copies during November\n1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles during this 12-month period.\n\n#### 376.1b. Chapter on Second World War revised and reset (1951)\n\nTitle as 376.1a.\n\nPp. \\[*2*\\], \\[i–viii\\] ix–xi \\[xii–xvi\\], \\[*2*\\], 1–552 \\[553–556\\].\n\\[1–18\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 376.1a variant except: \\[*1*–*2*\\] blank; \\[iv\\] *First*\nstatement omitted; \\[*1*\\] fly title; \\[*2*\\] blank; 1–532 text; 533–552\nINDEX; \\[553–556\\] blank. *Note:* The subject matter of the twelve maps\nremains the same as 376.1a, but all of the maps are redrawn.\n\n*Jacket B:* As 376.1a except statement at foot of front panel: “With a\nspecial chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle up to date.”\n(*Spring 1951*)\n\nChapter 21, “The Second World War,” was substantially revised and\ncompletely reset. It was 21 pages longer than 376.1a. The index, which\nwas also completely reset, increased in length by four pages.\n\nIn Chapter 3, “The Conquest of New France and the Movement for\nIndependence,” the sentence “The second era had for its most prominent\nfeature the missionary activity of a band of devoted men, representing\nthe Franciscans, the Recollects, the Ursulines, and above all the\nJesuits” (376.1a, p. 64, line 19), was changed to “activity of a band of\ndevoted people” (376.1b, p. 64, line 19). The change from “men” to\n“people” reflected the realization that the Ursulines were a teaching\norder of nuns.\n\nA revised Pocket Books edition containing the new chapter on the Second\nWorld War and additional revisions not in ML 376.1b was published in\nFebruary 1951, but it retained the reading “a band of devoted men”\n(Pocket Books, rev. ed., 1951, p. 59).\n\nThe “new enlarged edition” (376.2) published in the ML in 1956 was\nphotographically reproduced from the 1956 Pocket Books edition and\nreverts to the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.2, p. 59). The 5th\nedition of *A Short History of the United States* (Knopf, 1966), which\nwas reprinted in the ML in 1969, also retains the reading “a band of\ndevoted men” (376.3, p. 63).",
