<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:   <br> What William James thinks about man, and the world, and man’s place in it, he has said in many books and many scattered papers. These do not present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died before the book was half done.  The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to complete his work. (<em>Fall 1925</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform philosophy jacket in moderate green (145) and black on cream paper. Signed: WC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> The world recognizes that William James stands pre-eminent among the philosophers of America. His writings have had an influence that has reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published December 1925. <em>WR</em> 19 December 1925. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Kallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on <em>The Philosophy of William James</em>. His royalties during the first six months of 1926 totaled $179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions fees to James’s original publishers. A few days after <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined. The ML published <em>Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell</em> (147) in October 1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial work appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926 Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was interested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the project three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which published most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary permissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection, <em>The Philosophy of Santayana</em>, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942 (see 355).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.</p>

These do not present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died before the book was half done.  The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to complete his work. (*Fall 1925*)     \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)     \n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform philosophy jacket in moderate green (145) and black on cream paper. Signed: WC.     \n\n> Front flap: <br> The world recognizes that William James stands pre-eminent among the philosophers of America. His writings have had an influence that has reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (*Fall 1934*)   \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published December 1925. *WR* 19 December 1925. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.   \n\nKallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on *The Philosophy of William James*. His royalties during the first six months of 1926 totaled \\$179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions fees to James’s original publishers. A few days after *The Philosophy of William James* was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined. The ML published *Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell* (147) in October 1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial work appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926 Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was interested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the project three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which published most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary permissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection, *The Philosophy of Santayana*, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942 (see 355).   \n\nSales of *The Philosophy of William James* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.     \n\n#### 119b.

His royalties during the first six months of 1926 totaled \\$179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions fees to James’s original publishers. A few days after *The Philosophy of William James* was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined. The ML published *Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell* (147) in October 1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial work appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926 Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was interested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the project three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which published most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary permissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection, *The Philosophy of Santayana*, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942 (see 355).   \n\nSales of *The Philosophy of William James* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.     \n\n"
