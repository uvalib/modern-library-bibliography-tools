<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>What William James thinks about man, and the world, and man’s place in
it, he has said in many books and many scattered papers. These do not
present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and
intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and
living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he
aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died
before the book was half done.</p>
<p>The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view
of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his
own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to
that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to
complete his work. (<em>Fall 1925</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform philosophy jacket in moderate green (145) and black
on cream paper. Signed: WC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The world recognizes that William James stands pre-eminent among the
philosophers of America. His writings have had an influence that has
reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the
social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence
of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always
the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and
forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His
is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (<em>Fall
1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published December 1925. <em>WR</em> 19 December 1925.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Kallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on
<em>The Philosophy of William James</em>. His royalties during the first six
months of 1926 totaled $179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions
fees to James’s original publishers. A few days after <em>The Philosophy of
William James</em> was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar
volume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined.
The ML published <em>Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell</em> (147) in October
1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial
work appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926
Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was
interested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the
project three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which
published most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary
permissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection,
<em>The Philosophy of Santayana</em>, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942
(see 355).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> during the first six months
of 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period
May 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.</p>
