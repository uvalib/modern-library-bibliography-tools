<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s finest
writers of short stories and plays when <em>The Young Lions</em> appeared.
The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented,
and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent
stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the
enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be
read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of
mind.”</p>
<p>Time has proved their judgments right, for this engrossing novel of
men at war is in fact a testament of our century. It is the story of
modern man in a moment of extreme ordeal, dramatically told by an
acutely sensitive creative writer. The editors of the Modern Library
are proud to include it as a work of distinguished and enduring
achievement. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
When <em>The Young Lions</em> was published in 1948, Irwin Shaw was already
widely recognized as one of America’s foremost short story writers and
playwrights. But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical
response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He
reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense
of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short
stories,” wrote <em>The Saturday Review</em>. The story of three young men—a
Nazi, a Jew, and an American—<em>The Young Lions</em> takes place bestween
[<em>sic</em>] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross
fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wrote <em>The New York
Herald Tribune</em>, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of
American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been
reconfirmed many times.</p>

But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical\n> response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He\n> reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense\n> of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short\n> stories,” wrote *The Saturday Review*. The story of three young men—a\n> Nazi, a Jew, and an American—*The Young Lions* takes place bestween\n> \\[*sic*\\] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross\n> fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wrote *The New York\n> Herald Tribune*, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of\n> American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been\n> reconfirmed many times.\n\nPublished spring 1982 at $7.95.
