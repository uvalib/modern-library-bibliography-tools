<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Margaret Mead’s study of adolescence in a primitive civilization has
become one of the classics of modern anthropological research. Even
more than a scientific observer of folkways, Margaret Mead was an
actual participant in the communal life of a Samoa untouched by
Western culture. This record of the psycho-sexual development of pagan
youth is an intimate and fascinating contribution to anthropology,
ethnography, sociology and psychology. By her comparisons between
primitive and modern attitudes toward eroticism, the emotional
differences in two remote social and cultural orders are brilliantly
illuminated. <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> is a book of enduring scientific
and literary importance. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by William Morrow &amp; Co., 1928. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5–8</em>], [<em>13–15</em>], 1–294) printed from Morrow plates with
illustrations omitted, page numerals removed from preliminaries,
dedication shifted to p. [<em>4</em>], and Index and Glossary added in place
of 3-page Glossary of Native Terms. Published spring 1953. <em>WR</em> 4 April
1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1958.</p>
<p>Mead was invited to select one of her books for inclusion in the ML. Her
reasons for choosing <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> are discussed in the
preface to the ML edition. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind,
and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I
have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never
write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.”
I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it
contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are
less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim,
by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come
to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the
way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems
to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the
years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very
fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the
limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the
potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social
invention—are far less likely to seem dated. (p. [<em>10</em>])</p>
