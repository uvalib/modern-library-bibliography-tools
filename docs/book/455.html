<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Margaret Mead’s study of adolescence in a primitive civilization has become one of the classics of modern anthropological research. Even more than a scientific observer of folkways, Margaret Mead was an actual participant in the communal life of a Samoa untouched by Western culture. This record of the psycho-sexual development of pagan youth is an intimate and fascinating contribution to anthropology, ethnography, sociology and psychology. By her comparisons between primitive and modern attitudes toward eroticism, the emotional differences in two remote social and cultural orders are brilliantly illuminated. <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> is a book of enduring scientific and literary importance. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by William Morrow &amp; Co., 1928. ML edition (pp. [<em>5–8</em>], [<em>13–15</em>], 1–294) printed from Morrow plates with illustrations omitted, page numerals removed from preliminaries, dedication shifted to p. [<em>4</em>], and Index and Glossary added in place of 3-page Glossary of Native Terms. Published spring 1953. <em>WR</em> 4 April 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1958.</p>
<p>Mead was invited to select one of her books for inclusion in the ML. Her reasons for choosing <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> are discussed in the preface to the ML edition. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind, and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.” I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim, by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social invention—are far less likely to seem dated. (p. [<em>10</em>])</p>

Even more than a scientific observer of folkways, Margaret Mead was an actual participant in the communal life of a Samoa untouched by Western culture. This record of the psycho-sexual development of pagan youth is an intimate and fascinating contribution to anthropology, ethnography, sociology and psychology.

Discontinued fall 1958. \n\nMead was invited to select one of her books for inclusion in the ML. Her reasons for choosing *Coming of Age in Samoa* are discussed in the preface to the ML edition. She writes: \n\n> My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind, and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.” I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim, by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social invention—are far less likely to seem dated.
