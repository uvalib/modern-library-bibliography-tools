<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Alive with light-tipped quips and stinging darts, <em>The Plays of Oscar
Wilde</em> represent in fullest measure the famous decadent’s unique
contribution to English letters. Master of the scintillant epigram and
electric repartee, he is nowhere so happy and felicitous as in his
dramatic writings. In time his prose may grow faint in memory and his
poetry may be given a somewhat less lustrous appraisal, but he will
always be remembered as the creator of these inimitably urbane, ironic
and effervescent comedies. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection combining ML editions of Wilde’s <em>Salomé, The
Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan</em> (76) and <em>An Ideal
Husband, A Woman of No Importance</em> (77). Pp. i–216, [<em>1</em>]–220 printed
from existing ML plates without revising the pagination. Published
spring 1932. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Four other titles by Wilde published in the ML between 1917 and 1926
were combined in the early 1930s to form <em>Poems and Fairy Tales</em> (242)
and <em>Picture of Dorian Gray &amp; De Profundis</em> (1.2b).</p>
<p><em>The Plays of Oscar Wilde</em> sold 2,919 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and
Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“I have nothing to declare except my genius,” Oscar Wilde once told an
American customs official. That genius is nowhere more apparent than
in his plays, whose witty dialogue and paradoxical situations still
have the power to charm, both on the stage and between covers. This
volume contains one of his most perennially popular, <em>The Importance
of Being Earnest</em>, whose satiric comments on English society and the
clergy have never been surpassed; <em>Salomé</em>, considered shocking in its
day, on which Richard Strauss’ opera is based; and three plays, <em>Lady
Windemere’s</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>Fan</em>, <em>a Woman of No Importance</em> and <em>An Ideal
Husband</em>, which give full play to Wilde’s scorn for hypocrisy.</p>

That genius is nowhere more apparent than\n> in his plays, whose witty dialogue and paradoxical situations still\n> have the power to charm, both on the stage and between covers. This\n> volume contains one of his most perennially popular, *The Importance\n> of Being Earnest*, whose satiric comments on English society and the\n> clergy have never been surpassed; *Salomé*, considered shocking in its\n> day, on which Richard Strauss’ opera is based; and three plays, *Lady\n> Windemere’s* \\[*sic*\\] *Fan*, *a Woman of No Importance* and *An Ideal\n> Husband*, which give full play to Wilde’s scorn for hypocrisy.\n\nPrinted from offset plates photographically reproduced from an earlier\nML printing.
