<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] COPYRIGHT, 1949, BY RANDOM HOUSE, INC. | [short rule] | FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION, 1949; v–xii INTRODUCTION | <em>by Louis Kronenberger</em>; [xiii] biographical note; [xiv] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–514 text.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Now, a century and a quarter after <em>Don Juan</em> was written, Lord Byron’s glowing narrative poem continues to exercise an undiminished appeal for readers of the widest variety of tastes. The young have turned to it, generation after generation, for the fullest expression of the romantic mood and gesture. This at once romantic and irreverent tale is cherished by people of all ages for its excitement as story, for its passion, its lyric felicity, its impudent satire and its lively wit. <em>Don Juan</em>, the first of Byron’s works to be included in the Modern Library series, is introduced, brilliantly and perceptively, by Louis Kronenberger. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commins was pleased with Kronenberger’s introduction. He wrote, “I have just this minute finished with cheers your marvelous Introduction for DON JUAN. It is written with such brio. I simply can’t stop marveling at how you exceeded your last wonderful effort. This is it! The piece sparkles, explodes and is always under such perfect control. Each new piece you do for us is another best” (Commins to Kronenberger, 1 July 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton University Library).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Based on the old Spanish saga familiar to us through Mozart and Molière, <em>Don Juan</em> is Byron’s acknowledged masterpiece. A sixteen-canto epic satire in ottava rima, it recounts the seductions and betrayals, mishaps and adventures of the rakish Spanish grandee. Byron’s “plan was to have no plan” but to “unpack his heart” in the person of his hero. By his own account he meant to be “quietly facetious about everything,” and he used the epic to satirize English life, customs, manners and morals. But beneath the satiric impulse was a hatred of hypocrisy and a consciousness of the power of illusion. If <em>Childe Harold</em>, as Louis Kronenberger remarks in his introduction, “is in large part Byronism, <em>Don Juan</em> “is Byron.” Romantic, irreverent, exuberant and entertaining, it is a “hymn to the earth,” but also a human sequence to “its own music chaunted.”
“There is something for us to learn from the courage and buoyancy with which Byron came to terms with a world as shabby and confused as ours.” —Dame Helen Gardner</p>

The young have turned to it, generation after generation, for the fullest expression of the romantic mood and gesture. This at once romantic and irreverent tale is cherished by people of all ages for its excitement as story, for its passion, its lyric felicity, its impudent satire and its lively wit. *Don Juan*, the first of Byron’s works to be included in the Modern Library series, is introduced, brilliantly and perceptively, by Louis Kronenberger. (*Fall 1949*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1949. *WR* 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Reissued 1984. \n\nCommins was pleased with Kronenberger’s introduction. He wrote, “I have just this minute finished with cheers your marvelous Introduction for DON JUAN. It is written with such brio. I simply can’t stop marveling at how you exceeded your last wonderful effort. This is it! The piece sparkles, explodes and is always under such perfect control. Each new piece you do for us is another best” (Commins to Kronenberger, 1 July 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton University Library). \n\n#### 420b.

A sixteen-canto epic satire in ottava rima, it recounts the seductions and betrayals, mishaps and adventures of the rakish Spanish grandee. Byron’s “plan was to have no plan” but to “unpack his heart” in the person of his hero. By his own account he meant to be “quietly facetious about everything,” and he used the epic to satirize English life, customs, manners and morals. But beneath the satiric impulse was a hatred of hypocrisy and a consciousness of the power of illusion. If *Childe Harold*, as Louis Kronenberger remarks in his introduction, “is in large part Byronism, *Don Juan* “is Byron.” Romantic, irreverent, exuberant and entertaining, it is a “hymn to the earth,” but also a human sequence to “its own music chaunted.” \n> “There is something for us to learn from the courage and buoyancy with which Byron came to terms with a world as shabby and confused as ours.” —Dame Helen Gardner \n\nPublished fall 1984 at \\$8.95.
