<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>That violent and erratic husband, Henry the VIII, was a molder of
history, a power-impelled dynast who influenced the destiny of
England. Opportunist, bully and intriguer, political strategist and
despot, self-appointed head of the national religion, executioner on a
large scale, a man of insatiable lusts and uninhibited will, he
ruthlessly dominated the country over which he reigned for
thirty-eight years. Francis Hackett’s chronicle of his varied life and
loves is a magnificent historical pageant and one of the most vivid
and colorful biographies of modern times. (<em>Fall 1949</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
That violent and unpredictable monarch and husband, Henry the Eighth,
was a power-driven despot who helped shape the destiny of England.
Bully, opportunist, shrewd intriguer and political strategist,
self-appointed head of the national religion, executioner on a large
scale, a man of insatiable lusts and ruthless will, he dominated the
country over which he reigned for thirty-eight years. Francis
Hackett’s chronicle of his erratic life and many loves is a historical
pageant of stirring events and colorful personalities. It is generally
acknowledged to be one of the most vivid biographies of modern times.
(<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published as <em>Henry the Eighth</em> by Horace Liveright, 1929. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with
illustrations omitted. Published fall 1949. <em>WR</em> 10 December 1949. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The ML paid Liveright a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy. The Liveright plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML
had to reset the text and make new plates. The ML’s typesetting was made
from a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he
indicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March
1949). The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates
became the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against
royalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed
nothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties
were due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition
passed 30,000 copies. Hackett received $750 from Liveright when the ML
edition was published and nothing thereafter.</p>
<p>Arthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930
lived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American
publishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of
his own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the
$2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that
the ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random
House he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in
December 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies,
leaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20. The ML had paid nothing to
Liveright since the initial advance in 1949 (Hiram Haydn to Hackett, 22
December 1958).</p>
