<p>Front flap:<br>
For 2,500 years the writings of China’s great sage have represented
the moral principles as well as the day-to-day standards of conduct
for countless millions of people in the East. Today, as much as ever,
his doctrines influence the way of life of the most populous nation on
earth. A completely new English text has been prepared for the Modern
Library edition of <em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> under the editorship of
Dr. Lin Yutang, the foremost interpreter of ancient and modern China
in America today. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published April 1938. <em>WR</em> 9 April 1938. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Several months before <em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> was published Cerf wrote
to a publishers’ representative in New Zealand, “I call your particular
attention to the Confucius volume, edited by Lin Yutang. I think this
will prove one of the most popular titles we have ever had, and we
expect about three times the normal advance sale on it” (Cerf to Nash &amp;
Kissling, 17 November 1937). Cerf’s prediction was correct. <em>The Wisdom
of Confucius</em> was one of the ML’s best-selling titles. In 1942 it was
the third best-selling title in the series.</p>
<p>While working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough
to think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on
Confucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and
besides the introduction, it will be principally the work of
translating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript
will be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January
1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s
financial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He
received $300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April
1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a
flat fee or was an advance against royalties.</p>
<p>Lin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did
not read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the
collection appears to have been challenged. In 1939 Random House paid
$250 for all rights to Miles Menander Dawson’s <em>The Conduct of Life (The
Ethics of Confucius)</em>, originally published by International Press in
1915.</p>
<p><em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> sold 12,000 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it seventeenth out of 281 ML and
Giant titles. Sales declined by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month
period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 4,036 copies, making it
sixty-first out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In 1945 the word “Jewish” was removed from the following sentence:
“[Confucius] could sing and be extremely polite, but he also could
hate and sneer with the hatred and contempt of a ‘real man,’ which was
shared by Jesus in his hatred of the Jewish scribes” (p. 27, line 16).
Freiman asked that the word be eliminated from the plates of both the
regular ML and Illustrated ML editions (Freiman to Parkway Printing, 21
May 1945).</p>
<p><em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> was shifted from ML 7 to ML 306 in fall 1959
when the six-volume Shakespeare was renumbered ML 2–7.</p>

A completely new English text has been prepared for the Modern\n> Library edition of *The Wisdom of Confucius* under the editorship of\n> Dr. Lin Yutang, the foremost interpreter of ancient and modern China\n> in America today. (*Spring 1938*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1938. *WR* 9 April 1938. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nSeveral months before *The Wisdom of Confucius* was published Cerf wrote\nto a publishers’ representative in New Zealand, “I call your particular\nattention to the Confucius volume, edited by Lin Yutang. I think this\nwill prove one of the most popular titles we have ever had, and we\nexpect about three times the normal advance sale on it” (Cerf to Nash &\nKissling, 17 November 1937). Cerf’s prediction was correct. *The Wisdom\nof Confucius* was one of the ML’s best-selling titles. In 1942 it was\nthe third best-selling title in the series.\n\nWhile working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough\nto think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on\nConfucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and\nbesides the introduction, it will be principally the work of\ntranslating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript\nwill be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January\n1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s\nfinancial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He\nreceived $300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April\n1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a\nflat fee or was an advance against royalties.\n\nLin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did\nnot read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the\ncollection appears to have been challenged. In 1939 Random House paid\n$250 for all rights to Miles Menander Dawson’s *The Conduct of Life (The\nEthics of Confucius)*, originally published by International Press in\n1915.\n\n*The Wisdom of Confucius* sold 12,000 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it seventeenth out of 281 ML and\nGiant titles. Sales declined by the early 1950s.
