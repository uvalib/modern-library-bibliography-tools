<p>A. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,
1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. after it acquired the American
branch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made
from a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively
by the ML. Published January 1933. <em>WR</em> 4 February 1933. First printing:
6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.</p>
<p>The original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.
For its edition of France’s <em>Revolt of the Angels</em> (163), published in
1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off
the running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the
headline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was
one of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf
considered doing the same for <em>Penguin Island</em> (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4
November 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The
result was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages
shorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.</p>
<p>The ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the
translator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years
after the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of
the title page of 253c, published in 1984.</p>
<p>The ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s
(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)
but picked up in the 1940s. <em>Penguin Island</em> sold 4,876 copies during
the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The publication of <em>Penguin Island</em> brought the number of France’s works
in the ML to five. <em>The Queen</em> <em>Pédauque</em> was discontinued at the end of
1933; by the end of 1942 <em>Penguin Island</em> was the only title by France
in the series.</p>

Devotees of the works of Anatole France agree without a dissenting
voice that <em>Penguin Island</em> is his most searching and satirical novel.
The history of the strutting penguins is the history of mankind,
recorded with the gentle but biting irony of the French master.
<em>Penguin Island</em> is one of the five titles by Anatole France in the
Modern Library series. It is prescribed reading for almost every
university course in contemporary literature. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
First published in 1908, and widely regarded as his masterpiece,
<em>Penguin Island</em> is Anatole France’s most searching and satirical
novel. A humorous critique of customs and laws, rituals and rites, its
subject is human nature, but its characters are penguins in the
mythical land of Penguinia. The story of the strutting penguins and
their virtues and vices is not merely a burlesque allegory of French
history, it is a satire of the history of mankind. With gentle yet
biting irony, France challenges the Spencerian belief in the ultimate
perfectability [<em>sic</em>] of man, though his irony reveals his sympathy
for man’s weaknesses and his need for social institutions.</p>

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173) and black on light\ngray paper depicting two penguins on a jagged mound of ice; borders in\nmoderate greenish blue, lettering in black with title highlighted in\nmoderate greenish blue. (*Fall 1932*)\n\nA. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,\n1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American\nbranch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made\nfrom a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively\nby the ML. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing:\n6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.\n\nThe original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.\nFor its edition of France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163), published in\n1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off\nthe running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the\nheadline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was\none of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf\nconsidered doing the same for *Penguin Island* (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4\nNovember 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The\nresult was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages\nshorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.\n\nThe ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the\ntranslator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years\nafter the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of\nthe title page of 253c, published in 1984.\n\nThe ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s\n(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)\nbut picked up in the 1940s. *Penguin Island* sold 4,876 copies during\nthe eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\nThe publication of *Penguin Island* brought the number of France’s works\nin the ML to five. *The Queen* *Pédauque* was discontinued at the end of\n1933; by the end of 1942 *Penguin Island* was the only title by France\nin the series.\n\n#### 253b.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173) and black on light\ngray paper depicting two penguins on a jagged mound of ice; borders in\nmoderate greenish blue, lettering in black with title highlighted in\nmoderate greenish blue. (*Fall 1932*)\n\nA. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,\n1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American\nbranch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made\nfrom a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively\nby the ML. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing:\n6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.\n\nThe original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.\nFor its edition of France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163), published in\n1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off\nthe running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the\nheadline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was\none of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf\nconsidered doing the same for *Penguin Island* (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4\nNovember 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The\nresult was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages\nshorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.\n\nThe ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the\ntranslator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years\nafter the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of\nthe title page of 253c, published in 1984.\n\nThe ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s\n(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)\nbut picked up in the 1940s. *Penguin Island* sold 4,876 copies during\nthe eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\nThe publication of *Penguin Island* brought the number of France’s works\nin the ML to five. *The Queen* *Pédauque* was discontinued at the end of\n1933; by the end of 1942 *Penguin Island* was the only title by France\nin the series.\n\n"
