<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Here are eighteen stories which prove that the “Western” is literature
as well as entertainment. In these exciting stories, from Bret Harte
and Mark Twain to Walter Van Tilburg Clark, the reader will find
outstanding contributions by the authors who broke the ground for
innumerable other writers. This collection is designed to follow the
development of the Western short story, and it captures the
adventurous spirit of the cowboy, the two-gun man, the desert
prospector, the gambler, the dance-hall girl, the cattle rustler, the
miner, the builder and the nester—all pioneers of the American West.
(<em>Spring 1945</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A in dark olive green (126) with new lettering for
title and statement of responsibility in brilliant yellow (83) with
“HARRY E. MAULE” in reverse; statement at foot as jacket A except
“Eighteen outstanding stories, including selections by Bret Harte, Mark
Twain, Owen Wister . . . .” in brilliant yellow. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML anthology; also published as <em>The Pocket Book of Western
Stories</em> by Pocket Books, Inc., 1945. ML edition published April 1945.
<em>WR</em> 5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p><em>Great Tales of the American West</em> was a joint venture between the ML
and Pocket Books, Inc. The Pocket Books edition, published in June 1945
and printed from plates made from a different typesetting, ran to 320
pages, forty pages shorter than the ML edition. It omitted Robert
Easton’s “To Find a Place” (ML ed., pp. 331–61) but the content of the
two editions was otherwise identical. The composition and manufacturing
costs for each set of plates was split equally between Pocket Books and
the ML. Maule, a RH editor, received a $250 advance against royalties of
3 cents a copy on the ML edition.</p>
<p>Hal Borland’s review of the ML edition in the <em>New York Times Book
Review</em> noted the absence of Will James, Andy Adams, and B. M. Bower.
Maule had tried to get something by James but the estate was tied up
with legal problems and had been unable to grant permission. Adams and
Bower wrote no short stories and Maule did not want to include
selections from novels. In a letter to Borland he noted, “There is
another omission which we are correcting because the Modern Library
feels that the permanence of the volume justifies the trouble and
expense. Through a mix-up I failed to include a WOLFVILLE story by
Alfred Henry Lewis but I am in touch with the estate now, and the next
printing will have one” (Maule to Borland, 3 July 1945).</p>
<p>No story by Lewis was ever included. The inflation that followed the
Second World War together with relatively slow sales of Maule’s
anthology may have ruled out incurring additional costs for permissions,
typesetting, and plate making.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em> (361) and <em>Best American Humorous
Stories</em> (380), <em>Great Tales of the American West</em> did not rank among
the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month
period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Henry – A Corner In Horses, by\nStewart Edward White – Beyond the Desert, by Eugene Manlove Rhodes –\nTappan’s Burro, by Zane Grey – Last Warning, by William MacLeod Raine –\nHopalong Sits In, by Clarence E.

MAULE”) in black and reverse against moderate\nolive green (125) panel at top and statement, “Eighteen outstanding\nstories, including selections by Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Owen Wister\n. . . .” in reverse and “A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK” in black against\nmoderate olive green panel at foot.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Here are eighteen stories which prove that the “Western” is literature\n> as well as entertainment.

This collection is designed to follow the\n> development of the Western short story, and it captures the\n> adventurous spirit of the cowboy, the two-gun man, the desert\n> prospector, the gambler, the dance-hall girl, the cattle rustler, the\n> miner, the builder and the nester—all pioneers of the American West.\n> (*Spring 1945*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A in dark olive green (126) with new lettering for\ntitle and statement of responsibility in brilliant yellow (83) with\n“HARRY E. MAULE” in reverse; statement at foot as jacket A except\n“Eighteen outstanding stories, including selections by Bret Harte, Mark\nTwain, Owen Wister . . . .” in brilliant yellow. (*Fall 1946*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology; also published as *The Pocket Book of Western\nStories* by Pocket Books, Inc., 1945. ML edition published April 1945.\n*WR* 5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\n*Great Tales of the American West* was a joint venture between the ML\nand Pocket Books, Inc. The Pocket Books edition, published in June 1945\nand printed from plates made from a different typesetting, ran to 320\npages, forty pages shorter than the ML edition. It omitted Robert\nEaston’s “To Find a Place” (ML ed., pp. 331–61) but the content of the\ntwo editions was otherwise identical. The composition and manufacturing\ncosts for each set of plates was split equally between Pocket Books and\nthe ML. Maule, a RH editor, received a $250 advance against royalties of\n3 cents a copy on the ML edition.\n\nHal Borland’s review of the ML edition in the *New York Times Book\nReview* noted the absence of Will James, Andy Adams, and B. M. Bower.\nMaule had tried to get something by James but the estate was tied up\nwith legal problems and had been unable to grant permission. Adams and\nBower wrote no short stories and Maule did not want to include\nselections from novels. In a letter to Borland he noted, “There is\nanother omission which we are correcting because the Modern Library\nfeels that the permanence of the volume justifies the trouble and\nexpense. Through a mix-up I failed to include a WOLFVILLE story by\nAlfred Henry Lewis but I am in touch with the estate now, and the next\nprinting will have one” (Maule to Borland, 3 July 1945).\n\nNo story by Lewis was ever included. The inflation that followed the\nSecond World War together with relatively slow sales of Maule’s\nanthology may have ruled out incurring additional costs for permissions,\ntypesetting, and plate making.\n\nUnlike *Great Modern Short Stories* (361) and *Best American Humorous\nStories* (380), *Great Tales of the American West* did not rank among\nthe 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month\nperiod, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n***Fall***",
