(<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in strong red (12) and black on cream paper depicting six theatrical masks overlapping inset black panel with title in reverse against inset panel except first and last letters extending beyond panel and outlined in black; borders in strong red, other lettering in black.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The modern point of view, contemptuous of all the old canons of Victorian morality, beauty and love, is nowhere more brilliantly championed than in the novels of Aldous Huxley. Full of shrewd commentaries and stinging humor, his books are extravaganzas that satirize the world of today. The two novels by which he is best known, <em>Point Counter Point</em> (No. 180) and <em>Antic Hay</em>, are in the same temper. Both are as sophisticated as the age they reflect. <em>Antic Hay</em> is a novel for the enlightened modern. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1923. ML edition (252.1, pp. 7–350) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published January 1933. <em>WR</em> 4 February 1933. First printing: 6,000 copies.</p>
<p>The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf invited Lewis Gannett to write an introduction to a forthcoming ML title of his choice. He selected <em>Antic Hay</em> as the most appealing but was disappointed with the $50 fee; he had assumed the ML paid more.</p>
<p><em>Antic Hay</em> sold 3,427 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. Huxley’s <em>Point Counter Point</em> (203) sold 7,733 copies—more than twice as many as <em>Antic Hay</em>—during the same period. <em>Antic Hay</em> was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and publishing rights to Huxley’s older books to Harper &amp; Bros. in 1939. Harper’s considered withdrawing <em>Antic Hay</em> and <em>Point Counter Point</em> from the ML, but Klopfer was able to negotiate new reprint contracts (see 203). New five-year contracts for the books were sent to Harper’s on 30 March 1939. The <em>Antic Hay</em> contract called for the ML to pay a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least 2,500 copies after three years.</p>

<p>New bibliographical edition (252.2, pp. 3–328) printed from plates of the English edition published in 1923 by Chatto &amp; Windus. It is not known whether Harper’s acquired the original Chatto &amp; Windus plates or had duplicates made. In 1948 William H. Rose of Harper &amp; Bros. wrote Klopfer that new plates were needed for <em>Antic Hay</em> and asked if the ML would share the cost (Rose to Klopfer, 7 June 1948). The plates were being used primarily by the ML, and Klopfer agreed to contribute $500 over a five-year period. During that time the ML paid an extra 2 cents a copy above the regular 10-cent royalty rate; any balance remaining was to be paid at the end of five years. The ML still owed $180 in 1953, so the ML appears to have sold 16,000 copies during that period (Rose to Klopfer, 23 July 1953).</p>
<p>Harper’s informed the ML in 1956 that they were planning to add <em>Antic Hay</em> to Harper’s Modern Classics but did not ask that the ML edition be withdrawn.</p>

Signed: L. (*Fall 1932*)   \n\n> Front flap:<br> The modern point of view, contemptuous of all the old canons of Victorian morality, beauty and love, is nowhere more brilliantly championed than in the novels of Aldous Huxley. Full of shrewd commentaries and stinging humor, his books are extravaganzas that satirize the world of today. The two novels by which he is best known, *Point Counter Point* (No. 180) and *Antic Hay*, are in the same temper. Both are as sophisticated as the age they reflect. *Antic Hay* is a novel for the enlightened modern. (*Spring 1936*)   \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1923. ML edition (252.1, pp. 7–350) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing: 6,000 copies.   \n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf invited Lewis Gannett to write an introduction to a forthcoming ML title of his choice. He selected *Antic Hay* as the most appealing but was disappointed with the \\$50 fee; he had assumed the ML paid more.   \n\n*Antic Hay* sold 3,427 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203) sold 7,733 copies—more than twice as many as *Antic Hay*—during the same period. *Antic Hay* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\nDoubleday, Doran sold its plates and publishing rights to Huxley’s older books to Harper & Bros. in 1939. Harper’s considered withdrawing *Antic Hay* and *Point Counter Point* from the ML, but Klopfer was able to negotiate new reprint contracts (see 203). New five-year contracts for the books were sent to Harper’s on 30 March 1939. The *Antic Hay* contract called for the ML to pay a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least 2,500 copies after three years.   \n\n#### 252.1b.

(*Spring 1954*)   \n\nNew bibliographical edition (252.2, pp. 3–328) printed from plates of the English edition published in 1923 by Chatto & Windus. It is not known whether Harper’s acquired the original Chatto & Windus plates or had duplicates made. In 1948 William H. Rose of Harper & Bros. wrote Klopfer that new plates were needed for *Antic Hay* and asked if the ML would share the cost (Rose to Klopfer, 7 June 1948). The plates were being used primarily by the ML, and Klopfer agreed to contribute \\$500 over a five-year period. During that time the ML paid an extra 2 cents a copy above the regular 10-cent royalty rate; any balance remaining was to be paid at the end of five years. The ML still owed \\$180 in 1953, so the ML appears to have sold 16,000 copies during that period (Rose to Klopfer, 23 July 1953).   \n\nHarper’s informed the ML in 1956 that they were planning to add *Antic Hay* to Harper’s Modern Classics but did not ask that the ML edition be withdrawn.   \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library:</span>   \nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (1930–1967) 203   \nHuxley, *Brave New World* (1956–1967) 485   \n\n",
