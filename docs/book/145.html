<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> Thomas Hardy’s conviction that men and women “are but helpless puppets in the hands of mischievous fate” is carried to its most relentless conclusion in “Jude the Obscure”. Such a storm arose after its publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another novel.
“Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as one of his most unforgettable creations.
(Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (<em>Fall 1928</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave, pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels. By common consent, <em>Jude the Obscure</em> is his masterpiece. Since its publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex and instinct. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74), deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black of a town street with cottage at left, tree at right and church tower in background; lettering in black and in reverse, all (including wood engraving) against strong yellowish brown background and enclosed in triple-rule frame in deep reddish orange. Signed: Galdone.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1895. ML edition (145.1, pp. [<em>5</em>–7], [<em>10</em>]–488) printed from a set of 1895 Harper plates with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September 1927. <em>WR</em> 5 November 1927. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were six additional printings totaling 16,000 copies between 1928 and 1931; printings between 1932 and 1939 totaled 11,000 copies. The ML’s printers damaged the plate for p. 107 sometime between 1929 and 1932; the last three lines of that page are missing in one or more printings from that period. The plate was repaired after Klopfer pointed out the problem (Klopfer to Harper &amp; Bros., 13 April 1933; A. W. Rushmore, Harper &amp; Bros., to Klopfer, 17 April 1933).</p>

This Modern Library edition reproduces the text of the 1912 Wessex edition, which incorporated all of Hardy’s final revisions. The Introduction is by Robert C. Slack of Carnegie-Mellon University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Printed from offset plates made from a new typesetting, following the text of the second edition (1903). Published November 1967.</p>
<p>Slack comments in the introduction about changes Hardy made between the 1895 first printing and the second edition in 1903. He states:</p>
<p>One scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903), Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in 1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br> <center> [1895] </center>
They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while, and faintly colouring.
She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they both turned, and regarded it.
‘You don’t think I threw it?’
‘O no.’
‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted it. He makes it into dubbin.’</p>
<center>. . . </center>
They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><br> <center> [1903] </center><br>
They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.
But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.
‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’
‘O no.’
‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown away.’</p>
<center>. . . </center>
They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge. 
In the revision Hardy has intentionally subdued the piece of pig’s flesh, and the scene of course is weakened. . . . (Introduction, pp. xxi–xxii).

(*Fall 1928*). *Note:* The epigraph is shifted from the verso of the fly title to the verso of the part title (p. [2]) by fall 1930. \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B. \n\n> Text on front:<br> Thomas Hardy’s conviction that men and women “are but helpless puppets in the hands of mischievous fate” is carried to its most relentless conclusion in “Jude the Obscure”. Such a storm arose after its publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another novel. \n> “Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as one of his most unforgettable creations. \n> (Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (*Fall 1928*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave, pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels. By common consent, *Jude the Obscure* is his masterpiece. Since its publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex and instinct. (*Fall 1935*) \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74), deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black of a town street with cottage at left, tree at right and church tower in background; lettering in black and in reverse, all (including wood engraving) against strong yellowish brown background and enclosed in triple-rule frame in deep reddish orange. Signed: Galdone. \n\n> Front flap as jacket B. (*Spring 1938*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1895. ML edition (145.1, pp. [*5*–7], [*10*]–488) printed from a set of 1895 Harper plates with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September 1927. *WR* 5 November 1927. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1990. \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were six additional printings totaling 16,000 copies between 1928 and 1931; printings between 1932 and 1939 totaled 11,000 copies. The ML’s printers damaged the plate for p. 107 sometime between 1929 and 1932; the last three lines of that page are missing in one or more printings from that period. The plate was repaired after Klopfer pointed out the problem (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 13 April 1933; A. W. Rushmore, Harper & Bros., to Klopfer, 17 April 1933). \n\n#### 145.1b.

(*Spring 1967*) \n\n*Jacket:* Fujita non-pictorial jacket in vivid red (11), deep brown (56) and black on coated white paper with author in brown script, title in red and brown decorative lettering and series in black, all against white background. \n\n>Front flap incorporates first sentence of 145.2 revised text followed by: <br> It is, in Hardy’s own words, a story “of a deadly war waged with old Apostolic desperation between flesh and spirit.” Its brooding concern with the strange and capricious turns of fate in Jude Fawley’s lifelong struggle for dignity against enormous odds gives this tale of aspiration and defeat the quality of classic tragedy. \n> This Modern Library edition reproduces the text of the 1912 Wessex edition, which incorporated all of Hardy’s final revisions. The Introduction is by Robert C. Slack of Carnegie-Mellon University. \n\nPrinted from offset plates made from a new typesetting, following the text of the second edition (1903). Published November 1967. \n\nSlack comments in the introduction about changes Hardy made between the 1895 first printing and the second edition in 1903. He states: \n\nOne scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903), Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in 1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference: \n> <br> <center> [1895] </center>\n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while, and faintly colouring. \n> She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they both turned, and regarded it. \n> ‘You don’t think I threw it?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted it. He makes it into dubbin.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge. \n\n> <br> <center> [1903] </center>  \n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him. \n> But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him. \n> ‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown away.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge. \n> In the revision Hardy has intentionally subdued the piece of pig’s flesh, and the scene of course is weakened. . . .
