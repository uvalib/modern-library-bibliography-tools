<p>Text on front:<br>
“It is not wonderful that such a man as Butler should be the author of
‘Erewhon’, a shrewd and biting satire on modern life and thought—the
best of its kind since ‘Gulliver’s Travels.’ . . . To lash the age, to
ridicule vain pretension, to expose hypocrisy, to deride humbug in
education, politics, and religion, are tasks beyond most men’s powers;
but occasionally, very occasionally, a bit of genuine satire secures
for itself more than a passing nod of recognition. ‘Erewhon,’ I think,
is such a satire.” (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in London, 1872, and in U.S. by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co.,

<p>Mumford received $50 for the introduction. When Cerf paid him he wrote,
“You are the first author in the history of the Modern Library who
delivered an introduction on time, and along with the enclosed check for
$50 go our sincere and amazed thanks to you” (Cerf to Mumford, 5 April
1927).</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in moderate bluish green (164) and black on cream
paper depicting a helmeted face with left half in black with feminine
features and dove and olive branch on helmet and right half in moderate
bluish green with male features contorted in anger and lightning bolts
and snake on helmet; lettering in black except EREWHON in cream outlined
in black, borders in moderate bluish green, all against cream
background. (<em>Spring 1933</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Erewhon</em> and <em>Erewhon Revisited</em>, considered by many the most
important works of their kind produced in the nineteenth century, won
a place for their author as one of the great satirists of all time.
Samuel Butler has been ranked in the glittering company of Voltaire
and Swift, and, like his literary predecessors, he spared neither
church nor state, literature or science from the attacks of his sharp
wit and ironic commentaries. Underneath his irrepressible, malicious
laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and
stupidity. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Erewhon Revisited</em> originally published in London, 1901, and in U.S. by
E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1910. <em>Erewhon</em> and <em>Erewhon</em> <em>Revisited</em> first
published together in Everyman’s Library, 1932. ML edition printed from
existing 146a plates (<em>Erewhon</em>) together with plates made from a new
typesetting (<em>Erewhon Revisited</em>). Published spring 1933. <em>WR</em> 15 April
1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The addition of <em>Erewhon Revisited</em> was part of an effort in the early
1930s to make ML books a better value in the Depression book market. In
1932 the ML combined Maupassant’s <em>Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other
Stories</em> (8) and <em>Love and Other Stories</em> (72) into a single volume,
<em>The Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant</em> (243). Wilde’s <em>Poems</em> (19) and
<em>Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose</em> (58) were combined as <em>The Poems and
Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde</em> (242). Wilde’s two volumes of plays,
<em>Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan</em> (76)
and <em>An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance</em> (77) were combined as
<em>The Plays of Oscar Wilde</em> (241).</p>

(*Spring 1936*)\n\n*Erewhon Revisited* originally published in London, 1901, and in U.S. by\nE. P. Dutton & Co., 1910. *Erewhon* and *Erewhon* *Revisited* first\npublished together in Everyman’s Library, 1932. ML edition printed from\nexisting 146a plates (*Erewhon*) together with plates made from a new\ntypesetting (*Erewhon Revisited*). Published spring 1933. *WR* 15 April\n1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe addition of *Erewhon Revisited* was part of an effort in the early\n1930s to make ML books a better value in the Depression book market. In\n1932 the ML combined Maupassant’s *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other\nStories* (8) and *Love and Other Stories* (72) into a single volume,\n*The Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* (243). Wilde’s *Poems* (19) and\n*Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose* (58) were combined as *The Poems and\nFairy Tales of Oscar Wilde* (242).

To lash the age, to\n> ridicule vain pretension, to expose hypocrisy, to deride humbug in\n> education, politics, and religion, are tasks beyond most men’s powers;\n> but occasionally, very occasionally, a bit of genuine satire secures\n> for itself more than a passing nod of recognition. ‘Erewhon,’ I think,\n> is such a satire.” (*Fall 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D.
