<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> With one-sixth of the habitable world governed by Marxian doctrines and with the rest of the world facing the possibility of a Communist social order, the writings of Karl Marx become more a modern revelation and prophecy than a mere economic interpretation of history. His <em>Capital and Other Writings</em>, judiciously and discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the shelf of the Modern Library. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of <em>Capital</em> and Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint of <em>The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of “Capital,”</em> edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L. Trask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML edition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until October because of additions to the manuscript. <em>WR</em> 12 November 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>The People’s Marx</em> does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S. The ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L. Trask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is usually done” (p. xix). The selections from <em>The German Ideology</em> and <em>Critique of Political Economy</em> in Part II were added by the ML.</p>
<p>Cerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932). Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a Russian magazine called <em>Education</em>. To this very orthodox statement by Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p. xix).</p>
<p>Shortly after the publication of <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings</em>, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested, Declined” under 1933 for more information.</p>
<p>M. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack of an index to <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings</em>: “I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to Schuster, 8 February 1933).</p>
<p>Sales figures from the 1930s are not available. <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings</em> sold 4,391 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 with sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings</em> had sold nearly 4,000 copies in the past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).</p>
<p>The ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s <em>Capital</em> (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br> Entire nations and even a continent have come under the dominance of the ideas taught by Karl Marx. His major work, <em>Capital</em>, is accepted in a large part of the world as revealed truth and its doctrines are looked upon as more than the economic interpretation of history the book attempted to offer. <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, written in collaboration with Friedrich Engels, framed the fiery slogans now familiar to the world. This volume of Karl Marx’s principal writings, edited by Max Eastman, includes the most important chapters form <em>Capital</em>, the entire <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, Marx’s conception of history and an essay by Lenin.

His *Capital and Other Writings*, judiciously and discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the shelf of the Modern Library. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of *Capital* and Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint of *The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of “Capital,”* edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L. Trask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML edition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until October because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.  \n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S. The ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L. Trask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is usually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and *Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.  \n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932). Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a Russian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p. xix).  \n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested, Declined” under 1933 for more information.  \n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack of an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*: “I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to Schuster, 8 February 1933).  \n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 with sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in the past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).  \n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s *Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.  \n\n#### 246b.

Publication of the ML edition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until October because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.  \n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S. The ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L. Trask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is usually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and *Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.  \n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932). Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a Russian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p. xix).  \n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested, Declined” under 1933 for more information.  \n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack of an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*: “I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to Schuster, 8 February 1933).  \n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 with sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in the past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).  \n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s *Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.  \n\n"
