<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Countless afflicted and sorrowing people from every part of the world
have found solace and inspiration in this testament to the heroism of
young John Gunther who died at the age of seventeen after a gallant
but losing fight against the ravages of a brain tumor. The record of
his brief life, so tenderly and poignantly portrayed, is the story not
so much of suffering and death, but of courage and consideration and
selflessness. Besides being one of the rare consolatory books in the
world’s literature, it has become immeasurably influential in the
campaign to combat cancer. For this edition of <em>Death Be Not Proud</em>,
John Gunther writes a new and profoundly moving account of the
influences this memoir has had on the fortunate as well as the sorely
stricken everywhere. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the years since it was first published, countless people from every
part of the world have found solace and inspiration in this poignant
record of the brief life of Johnny Gunther, who died at the age of
seventeen after a gallant but losing battle against the ravages of a
brain tumor.</p>
<p>As John Gunther writes in his introduction, “<em>Death Be Not Proud</em> is a
story not merely of suffering, harrowing as that suffering was, but of
courage. Most readers, I have found, think of it not so much as the
account of a brilliantly promising boy’s untimely death, but of plain,
simple, primal courage—heroism would not be too strong a word.”</p>
