<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
It is both as philosopher and experimental psychologist that William
James approached the study of religious phenomena. Conversion,
repentance, mysticism, hopes of reward and fears of punishment in the
hereafter are studied with boldness, sympathy and the unbiased common
sense of science. The result is a book that has become a living force
in religious literature, for believer and non-believer alike, and has
contributed to maintain William James’s status as the greatest
American philosopher. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in New York and London by Longmans, Green &amp; Co.,
1902. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published November 1936. <em>WR</em> 21 November 1936. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The ML paid Longmans, Green an advance of $500. The ML’s reprint rights
were limited to the U.S. since Longmans, Green in London retained rights
to the Canadian market (Klopfer to Walter Jefferay, Longmans, Green, 26
May 1936). The original royalty rate has not been ascertained but was
probably 10 cents a copy. In 1958, shortly before <em>The Varieties of
Religious Experience</em> entered the public domain, Klopfer inquired
whether a reduction in royalties would be appropriate (Klopfer to
Longmans, Green, 14 February 1958). In 1970 the ML was paying royalties
of 5 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em> sold 6,519 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It ranked in the first quarter of ML and
Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952
with sales of 5,390 copies. <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> (119) did
not sell as well as <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>. It sold
5,378 copies during the 1942–43 period, placing it near the bottom of
the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during 1951–52.</p>

Conversion,\n> repentance, mysticism, hopes of reward and fears of punishment in the\n> hereafter are studied with boldness, sympathy and the unbiased common\n> sense of science. The result is a book that has become a living force\n> in religious literature, for believer and non-believer alike, and has\n> contributed to maintain William James’s status as the greatest\n> American philosopher. (*Fall 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in New York and London by Longmans, Green & Co.,\n1902. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.\nPublished November 1936. *WR* 21 November 1936. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nThe ML paid Longmans, Green an advance of $500. The ML’s reprint rights\nwere limited to the U.S. since Longmans, Green in London retained rights\nto the Canadian market (Klopfer to Walter Jefferay, Longmans, Green, 26\nMay 1936). The original royalty rate has not been ascertained but was\nprobably 10 cents a copy. In 1958, shortly before *The Varieties of\nReligious Experience* entered the public domain, Klopfer inquired\nwhether a reduction in royalties would be appropriate (Klopfer to\nLongmans, Green, 14 February 1958). In 1970 the ML was paying royalties\nof 5 cents a copy.\n\n*The Varieties of Religious Experience* sold 6,519 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It ranked in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952\nwith sales of 5,390 copies. *The Philosophy of William James* (119) did\nnot sell as well as *The Varieties of Religious Experience*. It sold\n5,378 copies during the 1942–43 period, placing it near the bottom of\nthe second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during 1951–52.\n\n#### 296b.
