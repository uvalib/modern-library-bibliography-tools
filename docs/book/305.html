<p><em>Contents:</em> Walden – A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (selections) – Cape Cod (selections) – The Allegash and East Branch (condensation) – Walking – Civil Disobedience – Slavery in Massachusetts – A Plea for Captain John Brown – Life without Principle.</p>
<p><em>Jacket A1:</em> Pictorial in moderate yellowish green (136), pale greenish yellow (104), dark gray (266), black and gold on coated white paper depicting a small figure gazing at a pond under a canopy of towering trees with low mountains and clouds in the distance; title and author in black and reverse on inset gold panel bordered in black, other lettering in black, all against pale greenish yellow background; bands on spine and flaps in strong green (141). Designed by Paul Galdone, July 1937; unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> To collect the representative writings of Henry David Thoreau within a volume of seven hundred and fifty pages has long been the ambition of the directors of the Modern Library. Now that ambition has been fulfilled, thanks to the selection made by the editor, Brooks Atkinson, who also contributes a penetrating critical and biographical introduction. This volume contains, besides <em>Walden</em>, the essays <em>Civil Disobedience</em>, <em>Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Life Without Principle</em> and many of the famous nature studies. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published September 1937. <em>WR</em> 25 September 1937. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The ML and Houghton Mifflin Co. both published Thoreau collections in September 1937. When the ML edition was announced, Robert Linscott of Houghton Mifflin told Klopfer that his firm was “rather daunted” by the news. Houghton Mifflin had thought that the ML was giving up its collection and would have abandoned <em>The Works of Thoreau</em>, an 872-page volume edited by Henry Seidel Canby, if it had known the ML was going ahead. The Houghton Mifflin collection included selections from Thoreau’s journals, which were still protected by copyright and had not been available to the ML. Linscott offered to lease the plates of Canby’s volume to the ML within eighteen months if the ML gave up its volume (Linscott to Klopfer, 7 July 1937). Klopfer replied that the ML had changed its plans as much as it could when the conflict was discovered and expressed the hope that the two books would not interfere with each other (Klopfer to Linscott, 8 July 1937).</p>
<p>When the Viking Portable Thoreau appeared in 1949, Brooks Atkinson told Cerf that it was “such a good job that your Modern Library Thoreau volume is behind the eight-ball.” He suggested replacing the selections from <em>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</em> on pp. 301–436 with the complete work (Atkinson to Cerf, 4 March 1949). Commins replied that he hoped Atkinson would allow the ML edition to remain unchanged. The complete text of <em>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</em>, he noted, would add 200 pages to the collection, at a resetting cost of around $2,000; changing the page numerals from p. 437 to the end would cost an additional $200 or $300 (Commins to Atkinson, 1 April 1949). The ML never acted on Atkinson’s suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Walden and Other Writings</em> sold over 6,000 copies by early 1939 (Cerf to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). It sold 11,558 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ninth best-selling title in the regular ML. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,694 copies, making it the regular ML’s thirty-second best-selling title.</p>

<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Fujita pictorial jacket in deep brown (56), strong red (12) and black on coated white paper with inset reproduction of B. D. Maxham’s daguerreotype portrait of Thoreau (1856) in black and deep brown; lettering in reverse, strong red and deep brown, all against black background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Henry David Thoreau’s vision of personal freedom—the concept that moral law and the dictates of the individual conscience are superior to civil law and governmental statutes—has become part of the American heritage, particularly pertinent to our own times. Thoreau spent his life listening to “a different drummer,” and in following his belief that the individual could lead a life of simplicity and independence apart from social organization and material civilization, he anticipated one of the major themes of contemporary America. His writings communicate his thoughts and offer us his personal vision of life as well as its tranformation [<em>sic</em>] into a practical working philosophy on which he based his life style.
This volume contains the full text of <em>Walden</em> as well as the essays <em>Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Life Without Principle</em>, and many of the famous nature studies. The editor, Brooks Atkinson, has contributed a penetrating critical and biographical introduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The offset plates for the text, contents pages, and introduction were photographically reproduced from a printing of 305a or 305b. Atkinson’s introduction is repaginated to correspond with 305c but the place and date of composition (omitted from 305c) is restored. The table of contents does not reflect the revised front matter of 305c–d: Scudder’s foreword is not listed at all, and Atkinson’s introduction is shown as beginning on p. vii.</p>

Designed by Paul Galdone, July 1937; unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> To collect the representative writings of Henry David Thoreau within a volume of seven hundred and fifty pages has long been the ambition of the directors of the Modern Library. Now that ambition has been fulfilled, thanks to the selection made by the editor, Brooks Atkinson, who also contributes a penetrating critical and biographical introduction. This volume contains, besides *Walden*, the essays *Civil Disobedience*, *Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Life Without Principle* and many of the famous nature studies. (*Fall 1937*)   \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published September 1937. *WR* 25 September 1937. First printing: Not ascertained.   \n\nThe ML and Houghton Mifflin Co. both published Thoreau collections in September 1937. When the ML edition was announced, Robert Linscott of Houghton Mifflin told Klopfer that his firm was “rather daunted” by the news. Houghton Mifflin had thought that the ML was giving up its collection and would have abandoned *The Works of Thoreau*, an 872-page volume edited by Henry Seidel Canby, if it had known the ML was going ahead. The Houghton Mifflin collection included selections from Thoreau’s journals, which were still protected by copyright and had not been available to the ML. Linscott offered to lease the plates of Canby’s volume to the ML within eighteen months if the ML gave up its volume (Linscott to Klopfer, 7 July 1937). Klopfer replied that the ML had changed its plans as much as it could when the conflict was discovered and expressed the hope that the two books would not interfere with each other (Klopfer to Linscott, 8 July 1937).   \n\nWhen the Viking Portable Thoreau appeared in 1949, Brooks Atkinson told Cerf that it was “such a good job that your Modern Library Thoreau volume is behind the eight-ball.” He suggested replacing the selections from *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers* on pp. 301–436 with the complete work (Atkinson to Cerf, 4 March 1949). Commins replied that he hoped Atkinson would allow the ML edition to remain unchanged. The complete text of *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers*, he noted, would add 200 pages to the collection, at a resetting cost of around \\$2,000; changing the page numerals from p. 437 to the end would cost an additional \\$200 or \\$300 (Commins to Atkinson, 1 April 1949). The ML never acted on Atkinson’s suggestion.   \n\n*Walden and Other Writings* sold over 6,000 copies by early 1939 (Cerf to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). It sold 11,558 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ninth best-selling title in the regular ML. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,694 copies, making it the regular ML’s thirty-second best-selling title.   \n\n#### 305b.

Maxham’s daguerreotype portrait of Thoreau (1856) in black and deep brown; lettering in reverse, strong red and deep brown, all against black background.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> Henry David Thoreau’s vision of personal freedom—the concept that moral law and the dictates of the individual conscience are superior to civil law and governmental statutes—has become part of the American heritage, particularly pertinent to our own times. Thoreau spent his life listening to “a different drummer,” and in following his belief that the individual could lead a life of simplicity and independence apart from social organization and material civilization, he anticipated one of the major themes of contemporary America. His writings communicate his thoughts and offer us his personal vision of life as well as its tranformation [*sic*] into a practical working philosophy on which he based his life style. \n> This volume contains the full text of *Walden* as well as the essays *Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Life Without Principle*, and many of the famous nature studies. The editor, Brooks Atkinson, has contributed a penetrating critical and biographical introduction.   \n\nThe offset plates for the text, contents pages, and introduction were photographically reproduced from a printing of 305a or 305b. Atkinson’s introduction is repaginated to correspond with 305c but the place and date of composition (omitted from 305c) is restored. The table of contents does not reflect the revised front matter of 305c–d: Scudder’s foreword is not listed at all, and Atkinson’s introduction is shown as beginning on p. vii.   \n\n#### 305e.
