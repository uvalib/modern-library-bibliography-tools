<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few poets in the history of English literature were gifted with a
greater range of theme and style than Tennyson. He wrote in many
forms, in many moods—and in his poetry he tried to cope with a world
of shaken beliefs and uncertain values. “In the essential nature of
his idealism and his disillusioned melancholy, his pervading sense of
irreparable loss,” writes Professor Bush in the Introduction, “he is
very much our contemporary, the poet of an age of anxiety.” (<em>Spring
1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published spring 1956. <em>WR</em> 17 March 1956. First
printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Originally published 1951 in MLCE and five years later in the regular
ML. Stein offered Bush a flat fee of $250 to write the introduction and
select the contents, with the manuscript due by 30 September (Stein to
Bush, 28 June 1950). Bush was behind schedule on a book he was working
on and replied that could not meet the September deadline (Bush to
Stein, 30 June 1950). Stein was flexible, and Bush accepted on the
condition that he would submit the manuscript as soon as he could (Bush
to Stein, 16 July 1950). The ML paid him an additional $50 for a student
assistant. The manuscript was delivered in mid-October 1950. Bush
received an additional $100 when <em>Selected Poetry of Tennyson</em> was added
to the regular ML (Stein to Bush, 1 March 1956).</p>
<p>The text was set from the Cambridge Edition, <em>The Complete Poetical
Works of Tennyson,</em> edited by W. J. Rolfe (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1898)
with “a few silent corrections” (Introduction, p. xix).</p>
