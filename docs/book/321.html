<p><em>Format:</em> 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and Blumenthal binding. <em>Six Plays of Clifford Odets</em> and Steinbeck, <em>In Dubious Battle</em> (322) were the first titles to be published in the ML’s larger 7¼ x 4⅞ in. format after it was adopted for all ML titles and the first to appear in the new binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in moderate yellow (87), light bluish green (163), very light greenish blue (171) and black on coated white paper with three diagonal brick-like panels tilting to the upper right with the 3-line collective title in reverse on the face of each panel: SIX PLAYS OF | CLIFFORD | ODETS against background in black; left side of each panel in very light greenish blue and base in light bluish green; titles of the six plays in black on light bluish green panel tilting toward the lower right, all against woven background pattern in moderate yellow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> In the Spring of 1935, when <em>Waiting for Lefty</em> was first produced by the Group Theatre, a new force made itself felt in the American drama. Since then Clifford Odets has extended and solidified his reputation as the most brilliant playwright of the younger generation. Each of his plays reveals an impressive development of his dramatic gifts. This volume includes all his work to date in their complete texts: <em>Waiting for Lefty</em>, <em>Awake and Sing</em>, <em>Till the Day I Die</em>, <em>Paradise Lost</em>, <em>Golden Boy</em> and <em>Rocket to the Moon</em>. (<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection; published simultaneously in a Random House trade edition at $2.50. Published September 1939. <em>WR</em> 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1972/73.</p>
<p>Cerf told Odets in 1938, “I consider you and O’Neill the two most important playwrights in America” (Cerf to Odets, 19 May 1938). Both were Random House authors.</p>
<p>The trade edition of <em>Six Plays of Clifford Odets</em> was published primarily for sale to libraries. The same plates except for the half title and title page were used for printings of the ML and trade editions. The plates were designed for the ML’s larger format that was introduced in fall 1939; they would have been too large for the ML’s balloon cloth format that remained in use through spring 1939.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 4,819 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br> In the 1930’s the Group Theatre made its presence felt with new plays, actors and writers who have since added great luster to the American stage. The most notable dramatist to emerge from that adventure in the theatre was Clifford Odets. In the Spring of 1935 his first play, <em>Waiting for Lefty</em>, was produced and it created a sensation, both as a <em>tour de force</em> and as a drama of substantial theme and sharply drawn character. Since that first production, Clifford Odets has extended his reputation with other plays of distinction. This volume includes the complete texts of the following plays: <em>Waiting for Lefty</em>, <em>Awake and Sing</em>, <em>Till the Day I Die</em>, <em>Paradise Lost</em>, <em>Golden Boy</em>, and <em>Rocket to the Moon</em>. (<em>Spring 1960</em>)</p>

First printing (1939)  \n\n[within double rules] SIX PLAYS | OF CLIFFORD ODETS | [rule] | WITH A PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR | [rule] | [torchbearer A2] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK  \n\nPp. [i–viii] ix–x, [1–4] 5–433 [434–438].

(182 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and Blumenthal binding. *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* and Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* (322) were the first titles to be published in the ML’s larger 7¼ x 4⅞ in. format after it was adopted for all ML titles and the first to appear in the new binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal.  \n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in moderate yellow (87), light bluish green (163), very light greenish blue (171) and black on coated white paper with three diagonal brick-like panels tilting to the upper right with the 3-line collective title in reverse on the face of each panel: SIX PLAYS OF | CLIFFORD | ODETS against background in black; left side of each panel in very light greenish blue and base in light bluish green; titles of the six plays in black on light bluish green panel tilting toward the lower right, all against woven background pattern in moderate yellow.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> In the Spring of 1935, when *Waiting for Lefty* was first produced by the Group Theatre, a new force made itself felt in the American drama. Since then Clifford Odets has extended and solidified his reputation as the most brilliant playwright of the younger generation. Each of his plays reveals an impressive development of his dramatic gifts. This volume includes all his work to date in their complete texts: *Waiting for Lefty*, *Awake and Sing*, *Till the Day I Die*, *Paradise Lost*, *Golden Boy* and *Rocket to the Moon*. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection; published simultaneously in a Random House trade edition at \\$2.50. Published September 1939. *WR* 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1972/73.  \n\nCerf told Odets in 1938, “I consider you and O’Neill the two most important playwrights in America” (Cerf to Odets, 19 May 1938). Both were Random House authors.  \n\nThe trade edition of *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* was published primarily for sale to libraries. The same plates except for the half title and title page were used for printings of the ML and trade editions. The plates were designed for the ML’s larger format that was introduced in fall 1939; they would have been too large for the ML’s balloon cloth format that remained in use through spring 1939.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 4,819 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 321b.

Since then Clifford Odets has extended and solidified his reputation as the most brilliant playwright of the younger generation. Each of his plays reveals an impressive development of his dramatic gifts. This volume includes all his work to date in their complete texts: *Waiting for Lefty*, *Awake and Sing*, *Till the Day I Die*, *Paradise Lost*, *Golden Boy* and *Rocket to the Moon*. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection; published simultaneously in a Random House trade edition at \\$2.50. Published September 1939. *WR* 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1972/73.  \n\nCerf told Odets in 1938, “I consider you and O’Neill the two most important playwrights in America” (Cerf to Odets, 19 May 1938). Both were Random House authors.  \n\nThe trade edition of *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* was published primarily for sale to libraries. The same plates except for the half title and title page were used for printings of the ML and trade editions. The plates were designed for the ML’s larger format that was introduced in fall 1939; they would have been too large for the ML’s balloon cloth format that remained in use through spring 1939.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 4,819 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n"
