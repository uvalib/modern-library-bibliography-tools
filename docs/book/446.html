<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Ben Jonson considered John Donne the first among the poets of his
time. That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been
reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life
ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St.
Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons
which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily
wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by
Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry
and a generous selection of his prose. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s <em>Complete Poetry
and Selected Prose</em>, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed
from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. <em>WR</em> 5
April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from
Nonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein
to Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The
ML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore
more economical to print.</p>
<p><em>The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne</em> was originally
scheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition
was postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of
$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an
additional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.
Stein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in
the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a
number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being
carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John
Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they
have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high
for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College
Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue
getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a
disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production
aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever
before. (Stein to Coffin, 15 May 1951)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A volume of Donne’s <em>Poetry and Prose</em>, ed. Frank J. Warnke, finally
appeared in MLCE in 1967.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Until this century, John Donne’s poetry was excluded from the
mainstream of English literature. To his friend Ben Jonson he was
“first poet in the world for some things,” but “for not keeping of
accent deserved hanging.” Dr. Johnson and Dryden, each a cultural
arbiter of his time, shared a low opinion of Donne’s work: according
to Dryden, he “affects the metaphysics . . . in his amorous verses,
where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair
sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their
hearts, and entertain them with the softness of love.”</p>
<p>But in the first three decades of this century Donne was the poet,
more than any other, to whom British and American poets turned for
inspiration in language and sensibility. This volume contains all of
Donne’s poetry and a substantial selection from his letters and
sermons, with a critical and biographical introduction by Charles M.
Coffin. <em>Note:</em> Ellipses in original.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
In the twentieth century, John Donne has become one of the most
influential and widely read of poets, for both his love poems and his
sacred verse. This volume contains all of his poetry and a generous
sampling of his prose, including “Ignatius His Conclave,” “Paradoxes,”
Donne’s most famous sermons, “Death’s Duel,” excerpts from “Devotions”
and many of his letters.</p>
