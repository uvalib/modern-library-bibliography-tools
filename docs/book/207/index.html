<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
It is generally conceded by critics, and certainly it is staunchly
maintained by hosts of readers, that Arnold Bennett’s most notable
literary achievement is <em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em>. This chronicle of the
Five Towns and France during the Siege of Paris is a project of heroic
proportions, accomplished with infinite skill, and of a scope that
invites comparison with the greatest novels of the Victorian era. It
is a tale of ordinary people during extraordinary times, told with an
insight encountered only in the works of the masters of fiction.
(<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1909. New
bibliographical edition with preface by Bennett published by George H.
Doran Co., 1911, and subsequently by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting that Doubleday, Doran
appears to have made for the ML’s exclusive use. Published January 1931.
<em>WR</em> 14 February 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1972.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four
long-sought Doubleday titles—Bennett’s <em>Old Wives’ Tale</em>, Maugham’s <em>Of
Human Bondage</em> (199), Walpole’s <em>Fortitude</em> (201), and Huxley’s <em>Point
Counter Point</em> (203)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from
Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML had
exclusive reprint rights to <em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em> and paid Doubleday,
Doran a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a
second printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of
3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in
1933. Cerf stated in 1946 that <em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em> “remains, year in
and year out, one of the most popular novels in the Modern Library”
(Cerf, “Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em> 29, 24 August 1946, p. 18).</p>
<p><em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em> was the third best-selling ML title during the
first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,816
copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing
it in the second quarter ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the
100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Signed: J. L.

This chronicle of the\n> Five Towns and France during the Siege of Paris is a project of heroic\n> proportions, accomplished with infinite skill, and of a scope that\n> invites comparison with the greatest novels of the Victorian era. It\n> is a tale of ordinary people during extraordinary times, told with an\n> insight encountered only in the works of the masters of fiction.\n> (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Hodder & Stoughton, 1909. New\nbibliographical edition with preface by Bennett published by George H.\nDoran Co., 1911, and subsequently by Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting that Doubleday, Doran\nappears to have made for the ML’s exclusive use. Published January 1931.\n*WR* 14 February 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1972.\n\nCerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four\nlong-sought Doubleday titles—Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Maugham’s *Of\nHuman Bondage* (199), Walpole’s *Fortitude* (201), and Huxley’s *Point\nCounter Point* (203)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from\nGarden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML had\nexclusive reprint rights to *The Old Wives’ Tale* and paid Doubleday,\nDoran a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a\nsecond printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of\n3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in\n1933. Cerf stated in 1946 that *The Old Wives’ Tale* “remains, year in\nand year out, one of the most popular novels in the Modern Library”\n(Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *SRL* 29, 24 August 1946, p. 18).\n\n*The Old Wives’ Tale* was the third best-selling ML title during the\nfirst six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,816\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing\nit in the second quarter ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the\n100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 207b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\n\\[within single rules\\] \\[7-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin second single-rule frame\\] THE | OLD | WIVES’ | TALE | BY |\nARNOLD | BENNETT | \\[below inner frame: torchbearer D6 at right; 3-line\nimprint at left\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK\n\nPagination and collation s 207a.\n\nContents as 207a except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[ii\\] publication and\nmanufacturing statements within single rules.\n\n> *Variant:* Pagination as 207a. \\[1–19\\]<sup>16</sup>\n> \\[20\\]<sup>8</sup> \\[21\\]<sup>16</sup>.
