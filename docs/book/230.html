[viii] blank; [<em>1</em>] fly title; [<em>2</em>] blank; [1]–557 text;
[558] blank; [559–563] ML list; [564–566] blank. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)
<em>Note:</em> To accommodate Dreiser’s plates the ML edition was ¼ inch taller
than the ML’s standard format; later printings in the balloon cloth
format were also ¼ inch wider. See the note directly below under 230a
variant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> Wider format with binding measuring 6⅞ x 4⅝ in. (175 x 117
mm). Pagination and collation as 230a. Contents as 230a except p.
[iv] entirely reset with transcription as 230a except first comma in
line 2 in italic and <em>First</em> statement omitted; [564–565] ML Giants
list; [566] blank. (<em>Fall 1939</em>) <em>Note:</em> The wider format may have
been introduced well before 1939. The wider format allowed more
generous inside and outer margins. It also meant that the endpapers
extended beyond Kent’s endpaper design, leaving a white border of more
than ⅛ inch at the fore-edge of the free endpapers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in moderate reddish purple (258) and black on cream
paper depicting a woman’s head and shoulders in left profile; borders in
moderate reddish purple, lettering in black. Signed C. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The story of the vicissitudes attendant upon the publisher’s
suppression, in 1901, of <em>Sister Carrie</em> is the history of America’s
emergence from the fog of suspicion and fear of realism in the novel.
On the score of his uncompromising fight, Theodore Dreiser must be
regarded a pioneer and liberator. His <em>Sister Carrie</em> pointed the
tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it
remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy,
tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown
internationally famous. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired
the Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W.
Dodge &amp; Co., 1907; Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1908; Harper &amp; Bros., 1912; and
Boni &amp; Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. [<em>1</em>]–557) printed from
Dreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1932. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Dreiser’s account of the original publication of <em>Sister Carrie</em>, “The
Early Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it
was rejected by Harper &amp; Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday,
Page at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a
reader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its
frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and
because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be
withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in
circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that
the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to
insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal
adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his
share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was
legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a
contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include
<em>selling</em>; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in
the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because
no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did
manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred
of them. (p. vi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html">James L. W. West
III</a>
notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a
vacation and read <em>Sister Carrie</em> in typescript. Perhaps his wife read
the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For
whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the
narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish
it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw
the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication.
Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed
to putting <em>Sister Carrie</em> into print, but that he was under no
obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and
Publication of <em>Sister Carrie</em>”, Dreiser Web Source, University of
Pennsylvania Library, 2000).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of <em>Sister Carrie</em> and left 450
unbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. <em>Sister Carrie</em> sold 456
copies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and
Dreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates
that the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies
of <em>Sister Carrie</em> were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &amp;
Company (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later
purchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of <em>Sister
Carrie</em>, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.</p>
<p>The ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a
$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the
advance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates
which had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited
to Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML
edition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.
Dreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing
was required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions
for the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s
death the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser
Papers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).</p>
<p>Dreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was
originally published in <em>The Colophon</em>, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s
Note on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern
Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as
much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and
spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser,
however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements
covering the two-fifty edition [the trade edition published by Boni &amp;
Liveright in 1917], and it was only in February, 1932, after more
attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us
do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sister Carrie</em> was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the
1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies
by the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of
$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). <em>Sister Carrie</em> sold 5,637 copies
during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the
second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in
the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The history of the vicissitudes attending upon the suppression, in
1901, of <em>Sister Carrie</em> is part of the history of America’s emergence
from the then prevailing atmosphere of prudery and suspicion. Fear of
realism in the novel prompted the campaign against writers who dared
challenge the romantic tradition. On the score of his uncompromising
fight against censorship and for the new and rising school of American
naturalism, Theodore Dreiser earned the right to be regarded as a
pioneer and liberator. His <em>Sister Carrie</em> was the forerunner of a
tendency in American fiction for at least a quarter of a century and
even today it remains a monumental achievement as a novel of great
sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness. For these qualities
alone Theodore Dreiser became internationally famous. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>

Signed C. (*Spring 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The story of the vicissitudes attendant upon the publisher’s\n> suppression, in 1901, of *Sister Carrie* is the history of America’s\n> emergence from the fog of suspicion and fear of realism in the novel.\n> On the score of his uncompromising fight, Theodore Dreiser must be\n> regarded a pioneer and liberator. His *Sister Carrie* pointed the\n> tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it\n> remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy,\n> tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown\n> internationally famous. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired\nthe Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W.\nDodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and\nBoni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. \\[*1*\\]–557) printed from\nDreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nDreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The\nEarly Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it\nwas rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday,\nPage at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a\nreader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:\n\n> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its\n> frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and\n> because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be\n> withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in\n> circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that\n> the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to\n> insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal\n> adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his\n> share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was\n> legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a\n> contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include\n> *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in\n> the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because\n> no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did\n> manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred\n> of them. (p. vi)\n\n[James L. W. West\nIII](http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html)\nnotes:\n\n> Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a\n> vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read\n> the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For\n> whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the\n> narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish\n> it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw\n> the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication.\n> Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed\n> to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no\n> obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and\n> Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of\n> Pennsylvania Library, 2000).\n\nDoubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450\nunbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456\ncopies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and\nDreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates\nthat the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies\nof *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &\nCompany (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later\npurchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister\nCarrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.\n\nThe ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a\n$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the\nadvance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates\nwhich had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited\nto Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML\nedition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.\nDreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing\nwas required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions\nfor the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s\ndeath the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser\nPapers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).\n\nDreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was\noriginally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s\nNote on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:\n\n> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern\n> Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as\n> much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and\n> spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser,\n> however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements\n> covering the two-fifty edition \\[the trade edition published by Boni &\n> Liveright in 1917\\], and it was only in February, 1932, after more\n> attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us\n> do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.\n\n*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the\n1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies\nby the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of\n$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in\nthe first quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n**230b.
