<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The problems of abnormal psychology are as manifold as the problems of
modern life. To understand the origins and manifestations of the
psychoses that afflict us, we must come to a better comprehension of
the biological and social factors involved. This handbook gives an
all–inclusive view of the interrelationship of mental diseases to the
forces in modern life which cause them. Here eminent authorities speak
in non–technical terms for the layman, that he may better understand
the causes and consequences of a maladjusted mental equipment.
(<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Published February 1929. <em>WR</em> 23 March 1929.
First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded fall 1954 by revised edition
(172.2).</p>
<p>Cerf asked Everett Dean Martin of the New School for Social Research in
1926 if there was any chance of including his book <em>Psychology: What It
Has to Teach You about Yourself and Your World</em> (W. W. Norton, 1924) in
the ML. If not, he asked whether Martin would be interested in compiling
an anthology on psychology as a companion to <em>An Outline of
Psychoanalysis</em> (108). Martin replied negatively to both (Cerf to
Martin, 21 September 1926; Martin to Cerf, 28 September 1926).</p>
<p>Cerf turned next to Gardner Murphy, who received royalties of 5 cents a
copy.</p>
<p><em>An Outline of Abnormal Psychology</em> sold 1,634 copies during the first
six months of 1930 and 1,113 copies during the first six months of the
following year. It ranked low in the second quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It did
not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during
1951–52.</p>
