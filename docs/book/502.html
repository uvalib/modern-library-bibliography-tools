<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Few men have been more widely read—and more misinterpreted—than Jonathan Swift. He did, it is true, call himself a misanthrope and many readers have been quick to regard him solely as a brooding, embittered critic of mankind.
Actually, he was an intensely loyal, warm person in his private life and an active, ardent participant in worldly affairs, using his great satiric pen with positive effects on many controversial issues. Readers of <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> already know that the narrative charm of that book is merely one aspect of a work infinitely rich in observation and wisdom. And the broad variety of matters that engaged Swift’s brilliantly incisive mind is fully represented in the many other masterpieces of prose and poetry in this volume. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> One of the greatest satirists in the English language, Jonathan Swift continues to speak to succeeding generations. In addition to his masterpiece, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>—a devastating picture of human nature and human foibles—this volume contains his scathing attack on religious excesses, <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>; his defense of the classics, <em>The Battle of the Books</em>; and his unforgettable <em>Modest Proposal</em> that, in order to avoid starvation, the Irish eat their children. The selections from his letters, essays and poems reveal another side of one of the most brilliant minds in English literature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> One of the unique books of world literature, GULLIVER’S TRAVELS describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship’s surgeon, first to Lilliput, a land inhabited by tiny people whose diminutive size renders all their pompous activities absurd; next to Brobdingnag, a republic of giants who are amused when Gulliver tells them about the glories of England; then to Laputa and its neighbor Lagado, peopled by quack philosophers and scientists; and finally to the land of the Houhynhnms, where horses behave with reason and control men, known as Yahoos, who behave like animals. A savage satire on man and his institutions, written with great wit and invention, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> has captivated readers for the past two centuries. This volume also includes the three other Swift masterpieces: <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>, <em>The Battle of the Books</em> and <em>A Modest Proposal</em>.</p>

He did, it is true, call himself a misanthrope and many readers have been quick to regard him solely as a brooding, embittered critic of mankind. \n> Actually, he was an intensely loyal, warm person in his private life and an active, ardent participant in worldly affairs, using his great satiric pen with positive effects on many controversial issues. Readers of *Gulliver’s Travels* already know that the narrative charm of that book is merely one aspect of a work infinitely rich in observation and wisdom. And the broad variety of matters that engaged Swift’s brilliantly incisive mind is fully represented in the many other masterpieces of prose and poetry in this volume. (*Spring 1958*) \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (212). Published May 1958. *WR* 19 May 1958.

A savage satire on man and his institutions, written with great wit and invention, *Gulliver’s Travels* has captivated readers for the past two centuries. This volume also includes the three other Swift masterpieces: *A Tale of a Tub*, *The Battle of the Books* and *A Modest Proposal*. \n\nPublished fall 1985 at \\$11.95. ISBN 0-394-60529-2. \n\nPp. vii–xix of 502a–b (Quintana’s general introduction, the fly title, the facsimile title page of *Gulliver’s Travels* (Dublin, 1735), and Quintana’s introductory commentary on *Gulliver’s Travels* are omitted from 502c.
