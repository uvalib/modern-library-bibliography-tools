<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Thoroughly characteristic of its splendidly gifted and barbarically
untameable author are these autobiographical memoirs—a production of
the utmost energy, directness and racy animation, setting forth one of
the most singular careers in all the annals of fine art. Cellini’s
amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the
sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and
self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is
impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and
fascinating books in existence. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of all the great personalities of the Renaissance, none more
completely embodies the bold and sumptuous period than Benvenuto
Cellini. His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble,
is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for
almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a
life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate
creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its
untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the
autobiographies of the world. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This remarkable biography, written between 1558 and 1562, reads like a
picaresque novel. It is, in fact, one of the most important documents
of the 16th century. Benvenuto Cellini, an audaciously self-serving
Florentine goldsmith, tells of his escapades with the frankness and
egoism characteristic of the Renaissance man, describing a life of
unequaled grandeur, passion and adventure. It remains today one of the
world masterpieces of autobiographical writing.</p>
