<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
To Pierre Louÿs, as it was to the Greeks, love is the most virtuous of
human sentiments. His famous story of the courtesan of Alexandria is
as unashamedly voluptuous as it is true to the period of antiquity in
which it transpires. When <em>Aphrodite</em> first appeared a storm of wrath
was whipped up by the guardians of morality. Today <em>Aphrodite</em> is
accepted by discriminating readers on its own merits as a novel of
sensual beauty, written in a rapturous prose, without shame and
without sin. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML translation. Published May 1933. <em>WR</em> 27 May 1933. First

<p><em>Aphrodite</em> sold 4,178 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant
