<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] <em>Copyright, 1938, 1944, by Random House, Inc</em>.; [v] dedication; [vi] blank; vii–ix <em>PREFACE</em> signed p. ix: <span class="smallcaps">Edgar Snow</span> | <em>Madison, Connecticut, May, 1944</em>; [x] blank; xi–xiii <em>CONTENTS</em>; [xiv] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–495 text; [496] blank; 497–514 EPILOGUE | <em>1944</em> dated p. 514: June, 1944; 515–529 <em>Index</em>; [530] blank.</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Nonpictorial on cream paper with lettering in deep reddish orange (36) and dark gray (266) as shown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front panel within a double frame in deep reddish orange: <br> A BRAND-NEW EDITION OF | EDGAR SNOW’S | RED STAR | OVER | CHINA | with additions to the text and a new last | chapter that bring the story of the conflict in | China up to the very last minute. | THIS IS THE BOOK THAT TELLS WHY | JAPAN CAN’T WIN! | The only foreign correspondent who penetrated deep into | Northwest China and returned to tell the tale describes with | first-hand detail the amazing stories of: |  The 6000-mile “Long March” of the army of Chu Teh, | “The Red Napoleon.” |  The inside story of the kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek, | and its tremendous consequences. |  China’s united front against Japan, and its war tactics | and objectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> No book published in America during the last decade has been so influential in interpreting to the Western mind the complexities and aspirations of present-day China as Edgar Snow’s <em>Red Star Over China</em>. Written with the authority of seventeen years of first-hand observation of the revolutionary events in the great centers and remote provinces, it has become required reading for everyone who seeks to understand the role of China in the world today. The author has revised this edition and provided a new introduction and epilogue to bring it up to the present. (<em>Fall 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1938. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with a new preface and epilogue. Publication announced for fall 1944. <em>WR</em> 3 February 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1953.</p>
<p>The Random House edition was out of print when Snow inquired about a ML reprint (Snow to Cerf, 10 November 1943). The original plates were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November 1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii).</p>
<p>The original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies. There were six printings of the ML edition with total sales of just over 27,000 copies (Commins to Harold R. Isaacs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 4 September 1956).</p>

First printing (1944) \n\n[within double rules] RED STAR | OVER CHINA | *BY* EDGAR SNOW | [torchbearer D5] | *Modern Library* *:* *New York* \n\nPp. [i–vi] vii–xiii [xiv], [1–2] 3–529 [530]. [1–16]<sup>16</sup> [17–18]<sup>8</sup> \n\n[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] *Copyright, 1938, 1944, by Random House, Inc*.; [v] dedication; [vi] blank; vii–ix *PREFACE* signed p. ix: <span class=\"smallcaps\">Edgar Snow</span> | *Madison, Connecticut, May, 1944*; [x] blank; xi–xiii *CONTENTS*; [xiv] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–495 text; [496] blank; 497–514 EPILOGUE | *1944* dated p. 514: June, 1944; 515–529 *Index*; [530] blank. \n\n*Jacket A:* Nonpictorial on cream paper with lettering in deep reddish orange (36) and dark gray (266) as shown. \n\n>Text on front panel within a double frame in deep reddish orange: <br> A BRAND-NEW EDITION OF | EDGAR SNOW’S | RED STAR | OVER | CHINA | with additions to the text and a new last | chapter that bring the story of the conflict in | China up to the very last minute. | THIS IS THE BOOK THAT TELLS WHY | JAPAN CAN’T WIN! | The only foreign correspondent who penetrated deep into | Northwest China and returned to tell the tale describes with | first-hand detail the amazing stories of: |  The 6000-mile “Long March” of the army of Chu Teh, | “The Red Napoleon.” |  The inside story of the kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek, | and its tremendous consequences. |  China’s united front against Japan, and its war tactics | and objectives. \n\n> Front flap:<br> No book published in America during the last decade has been so influential in interpreting to the Western mind the complexities and aspirations of present-day China as Edgar Snow’s *Red Star Over China*. Written with the authority of seventeen years of first-hand observation of the revolutionary events in the great centers and remote provinces, it has become required reading for everyone who seeks to understand the role of China in the world today. The author has revised this edition and provided a new introduction and epilogue to bring it up to the present. (*Fall 1944*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1938. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with a new preface and epilogue. Publication announced for fall 1944. *WR* 3 February 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1953. \n\nThe Random House edition was out of print when Snow inquired about a ML reprint (Snow to Cerf, 10 November 1943). The original plates were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November 1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii). \n\nThe original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies. There were six printings of the ML edition with total sales of just over 27,000 copies (Commins to Harold R. Isaacs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 4 September 1956). \n\n#### 374b.

Written with the authority of seventeen years of first-hand observation of the revolutionary events in the great centers and remote provinces, it has become required reading for everyone who seeks to understand the role of China in the world today. The author has revised this edition and provided a new introduction and epilogue to bring it up to the present. (*Fall 1944*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1938. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with a new preface and epilogue. Publication announced for fall 1944. *WR* 3 February 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1953. \n\nThe Random House edition was out of print when Snow inquired about a ML reprint (Snow to Cerf, 10 November 1943). The original plates were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November 1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii). \n\nThe original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies. There were six printings of the ML edition with total sales of just over 27,000 copies (Commins to Harold R. Isaacs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 4 September 1956). \n\n"
