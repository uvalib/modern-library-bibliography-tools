<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The basic concepts of present-day psychoanalysis—both as to theory and
to therapy—are contained in this book. Beginning with Freud’s
cornerstone formulations, the <em>Outline of Psychoanalysis</em> presents a
clear and accurate picture of all the major developments in the field.
Here the reader will find authoritative statements by Freud, Adler,
Jung, Reich, Abraham, Sullivan, Horney, Alexander, and other
distinguished figures too numerous to list.</p>
<p>For an understanding of man’s nature and development, his goals and
difficulties, his driving forces and defenses—for this and more, the
reader will do well to know the substance of this book. (Spring 1955)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Outline of Psychoanalysis</em>, edited by
J. S. Van Teslaar (108). Published spring 1955. <em>WR</em> 25 June 1955. First
printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The revision of <em>An Outline of Psychoanalysis</em>, originally published in
1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision of <em>An Outline of
Abnormal Psychology</em> (172). Clara Thompson, Executive Director of the
William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and
Psychology, was recommended by Gardner Murphy shortly after he agreed to
revise <em>An Outline of Abnormal Psychology</em> (Murphy to Stein, 23 May
1953).</p>
<p>Thompson and her fellow editors tried to present “the many approaches
which go to make up a science such as psychoanalysis” (p. [ix]) but
ran into major obstacles in securing permissions. W. W. Norton, the
publisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to
allow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton
expressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the
original editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not
to have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to
Stein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was
disturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing
(Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by
these authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to
include them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word.</p>
<p>Anna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to
appear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections
by their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The
Emotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.”
Gitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative
table of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by &amp;
large, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of
psychoanalysis.” He continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel,
Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge
significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in
common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the
standpoint from which I view it. . . .</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in
their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can
sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the
“interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan,
Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would
appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense
in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a
misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book,
<em>The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense</em>. “My reason for this,” she
wrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the
other contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter
would create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July
1954). Stein replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In planning the <em>Outline of Psychoanalysis</em>, we have tried to
represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing
that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would
fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I
say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the
highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to
a proper view of psychoanalysis. The other category in the collection
is controversial material. We have tried to present some impression of
the differing viewpoints that now exist. . . . Consequently, many
people who differ on a scientific basis with each other will appear in
this volume without there being any suggestion that one is right and
the other wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He offered to include a statement in the book “explaining that many
different viewpoints are represented here and that the presence of any
particular writer’s material . . . does not imply an endorsement of the
views expressed by other writers in the book” (Stein to Freud, 8 July
1954). But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your
arguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part”
(Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954).</p>

(Spring 1955)\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, edited by\nJ. S. Van Teslaar (108). Published spring 1955. *WR* 25 June 1955. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe revision of *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*, originally published in\n1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision of *An Outline of\nAbnormal Psychology* (172). Clara Thompson, Executive Director of the\nWilliam Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and\nPsychology, was recommended by Gardner Murphy shortly after he agreed to\nrevise *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* (Murphy to Stein, 23 May\n1953).\n\nThompson and her fellow editors tried to present “the many approaches\nwhich go to make up a science such as psychoanalysis” (p. \\[ix\\]) but\nran into major obstacles in securing permissions. W. W. Norton, the\npublisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to\nallow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton\nexpressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the\noriginal editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not\nto have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to\nStein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was\ndisturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing\n(Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by\nthese authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to\ninclude them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word.\n\nAnna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to\nappear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections\nby their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The\nEmotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.”\nGitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative\ntable of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by &\nlarge, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of\npsychoanalysis.” He continued:\n\n> All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel,\n> Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge\n> significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in\n> common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the\n> standpoint from which I view it. . . .\n>\n> Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in\n> their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can\n> sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the\n> “interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan,\n> Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would\n> appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense\n> in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a\n> misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954).\n\nAnna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book,\n*The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense*. “My reason for this,” she\nwrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the\nother contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter\nwould create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July\n1954). Stein replied:\n\n> In planning the *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, we have tried to\n> represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing\n> that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would\n> fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I\n> say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the\n> highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to\n> a proper view of psychoanalysis. The other category in the collection\n> is controversial material. We have tried to present some impression of\n> the differing viewpoints that now exist. . . . Consequently, many\n> people who differ on a scientific basis with each other will appear in\n> this volume without there being any suggestion that one is right and\n> the other wrong.\n\nHe offered to include a statement in the book “explaining that many\ndifferent viewpoints are represented here and that the presence of any\nparticular writer’s material . . . does not imply an endorsement of the\nviews expressed by other writers in the book” (Stein to Freud, 8 July\n1954). But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your\narguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part”\n(Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*Outline of Psychoanalysis,* ed.
