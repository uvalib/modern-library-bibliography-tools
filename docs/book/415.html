<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a volume
that would include within 700 [±its more than 600] pages the
representative lyrical writings of the classic Roman poets. With this
book that need is now fulfilled. It includes the widest possible
variety of odes, satires, eclogues, elegies and epigrams that have
come down the centuries from such poets as Catullus, Lucretius,
Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, Seneca, Juvenal, Martial and others.
The translations by many skilled hands are the best obtainable, and
the Introduction by F. R. B. Godolphin brilliantly interprets the
poets and the verse of antiquity. (<em>Spring 1949; [Spring 1959]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published spring 1949. <em>WR</em> 29 January 1949.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Godolphin wanted to use Ezra Pound’s translations of seven elegies of
Propertius, but New Directions indicated that the permission fee would
be $250. Commins thought that the normal fee should be about $10 per
translation and declared, “I’ll be damned if we’ll pay anything like it”
(Commins to Godolphin, 18 November 1948). The Pound translations were
not used. Sales totaled 20,098 copies by spring 1958.</p>
<p>An internal Random House memo indicated in 1968 that <em>The Latin Poets</em>
could not be shifted to Vintage Books, the firm’s quality paperback
series, because permissions for use of copyrighted translations in the
anthology applied specifically to the ML edition. A decision was made at
that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity
as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November
1968).</p>
