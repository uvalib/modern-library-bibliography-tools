<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
It is not without reason that <em>The Good Earth</em> has been the most
successful book since <em>Quo Vadis</em>, 38 years ago. Its immense
popularity can be attributed to the humanity of the people who come to
life in its pages and to the Biblical simplicity of its writing. It is
a book that takes root deep in the heart of mankind. <em>The Good Earth</em>
is more than a mere portrayal of Oriental life; it is the epic of
man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world.
(<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by John Day Co., 1931. ML edition (266.1, pp.
[1]–[375]) printed from Day plates with battered page numeral “375”
removed. Published February 1934. <em>WR</em> 10 February 1934. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1970.</p>
<p>The ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major
best-seller like <em>The Good Earth</em>, which headed the best-seller list for
two years (1931–32). Grosset &amp; Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher
of hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap
between its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint
rights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933
about a ML edition of <em>The Good Earth</em>, he was told that it would be
many months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf
to Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January
1933). Arrangements were made later that year for <em>The Good Earth</em> to
appear first in Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and
shortly thereafter in the ML.</p>
<p>Buck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long
letter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies
to Her Chinese Critic” in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> (15 January
1933).</p>
<p>Three months after Pocket Books published <em>The Good Earth</em> as a
twenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this
book holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many
other editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our
Modern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative
sales figures for the Grosset &amp; Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for
the eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following:
Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH
box 141, folder D1).</p>
<p>Sales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War,
reflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced
interest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p><em>The Good Earth</em> was shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML
published its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.</p>
<p>The ML’s reprint contract for <em>The Good Earth</em> was terminated in July
1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies.
Together with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML
stock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.</p>

ML edition (266.1, pp.\n\\[1\\]–\\[375\\]) printed from Day plates with battered page numeral “375”\nremoved. Published February 1934. *WR* 10 February 1934. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued fall 1970.\n\nThe ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major\nbest-seller like *The Good Earth*, which headed the best-seller list for\ntwo years (1931–32). Grosset & Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher\nof hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap\nbetween its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint\nrights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933\nabout a ML edition of *The Good Earth*, he was told that it would be\nmany months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf\nto Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January\n1933). Arrangements were made later that year for *The Good Earth* to\nappear first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and\nshortly thereafter in the ML.\n\nBuck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long\nletter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies\nto Her Chinese Critic” in the *New York Times Book Review* (15 January\n1933).\n\nThree months after Pocket Books published *The Good Earth* as a\ntwenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this\nbook holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many\nother editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our\nModern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative\nsales figures for the Grosset & Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for\nthe eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following:\nGrosset & Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH\nbox 141, folder D1).\n\nSales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War,\nreflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced\ninterest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n*The Good Earth* was shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML\npublished its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.\n\nThe ML’s reprint contract for *The Good Earth* was terminated in July\n1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies.\nTogether with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML\nstock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.\n\n#### 266.1b.
