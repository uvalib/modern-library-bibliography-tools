<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in dark reddish orange (38) and black on cream paper depicting a male doctor looking into a microscope and a woman watching over his shoulder; borders in dark reddish orange, lettering in black. Signed: L. (<em>Spring 1933</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> On one question, at least, critics and readers of Sinclair Lewis’s works are likely to agree—<em>Arrowsmith</em> is his greatest novel. In it the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature has created a gallery of characters which, it is safe to predict, will remain unforgettable for generations. Leora, the indomitable comrade and wife; Gottlieb, the incorruptible scientist; Sondelius, the crusader against plagues; and Arrowsmith, the doctor in whom a holy flame is kindled— these are characters who give to the novel its immense power and its blazing indignation. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1925. ML edition (254.1, pp. [iii], 1–448) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February 1933. <em>WR</em> 4 March 1933. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1952.</p>
<p>The ML edition (254.1a) was larger than the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format so that it could be printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Publication of the ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film version starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the appearance of Lewis’s new novel <em>Ann Vickers.</em> The ML urged booksellers to feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement, <em>PW</em>, 14 January 1933, p. 98).</p>
<p>The ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset &amp; Dunlap, which also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace plates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the original Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier &amp; Son.</p>
<p><em>Arrowsmith</em> sold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making <em>Arrowsmith</em> the thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153 copies ahead of Hemingway, <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>.</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for <em>Arrowsmith</em>, Lewis’s <em>Babbitt</em>, and seven other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML’s contract for <em>Arrowsmith</em> had four years to run. Harcourt, Brace confirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the firm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to Klopfer, 28 April 1952).</p>

First printing (1933)   \n\n[within double rules] ARROWSMITH | [rule] | BY | SINCLAIR LEWIS | [rule] | [torchbearer A2] | [rule] | BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK   \n\nPp. [*2*], [i–iv] v–x, [*2*], 1–448 [449–450]. [1–14]<sup>16</sup> [15]<sup>8</sup>. 6⅞ x 4⅝ (174 x 115 mm) with leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in.

Signed: L. (*Spring 1933*)   \n\n> Front flap:<br> On one question, at least, critics and readers of Sinclair Lewis’s works are likely to agree—*Arrowsmith* is his greatest novel. In it the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature has created a gallery of characters which, it is safe to predict, will remain unforgettable for generations. Leora, the indomitable comrade and wife; Gottlieb, the incorruptible scientist; Sondelius, the crusader against plagues; and Arrowsmith, the doctor in whom a holy flame is kindled— these are characters who give to the novel its immense power and its blazing indignation. (*Spring 1936*)   \n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1925. ML edition (254.1, pp. [iii], 1–448) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February 1933. *WR* 4 March 1933. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1952.   \n\nThe ML edition (254.1a) was larger than the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format so that it could be printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Publication of the ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film version starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the appearance of Lewis’s new novel *Ann Vickers.* The ML urged booksellers to feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement, *PW*, 14 January 1933, p. 98).   \n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset & Dunlap, which also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace plates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the original Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier & Son.   \n\n*Arrowsmith* sold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making *Arrowsmith* the thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153 copies ahead of Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*.   \n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *Arrowsmith*, Lewis’s *Babbitt*, and seven other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML’s contract for *Arrowsmith* had four years to run. Harcourt, Brace confirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the firm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S.
