<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
As philosopher and man, Henri Bergson is one of the most esteemed
intellectual figures of the twentieth century. His major work,
<em>Creative Evolution</em>, embodies his chief contribution to the study of
reality as life and change. Influential among philosophers and popular
among general readers because of its persuasive argument and vivid
illustrations, this book has achieved permanence in the literature of
philosophical speculation. It takes an honored place in the Modern
Library series as a work of enduring vitality and ever–renewing
meaning to succeeding generations of thoughtful readers. (<em>Spring
1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except in medium gray (265) and black. Front
flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1945</em>) Flap text reset with “was” substituted
for “is” in first sentence (Bergson died in 1941). (<em>Spring 1960</em>)</p>
<p>Mitchell translation originally published by Henry Holt and Co., 1911.
ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for February 1944. <em>WR</em> 22 April 1944. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML paid Holt a $750 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.
When Cerf first approached Holt he noted, “I have never read Bergson’s
CREATIVE EVOLUTION. I am taking Irwin Edman’s word on this one” (Cerf to
William Sloan, Holt, 15 March 1943). He offered an advance of $1,000 on
the assumption that the ML would be able to print from Holt plates, but
Sloan discovered that the plates had been melted as part of the war
effort. Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with
the plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that
composition and plates would cost at least $500 and suggested reducing
the advance from $1,000 to $750, to which Cerf agreed. Edman received
$250 for the Foreword (Commins to Edman, 2 December 1943).</p>
