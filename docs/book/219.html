<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of all the distinguished novels written by Willa Cather, none has
brought her greater prestige or a wider circle of readers than <em>Death
Comes for the Archbishop</em>. This historical chronicle of the apostolic
mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and
Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity. Its
rich humanity and its stirring account of the tenacity of a race
giving way to the inevitable make it a memorable book to readers of
every shade of religious conviction and literary taste. (<em>Spring
1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published
September 1931. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies.
Discontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.</p>
<p>Willa Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to
include in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright.
Cerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s <em>My
Ántonia</em> or <em>The Song of the Lark</em>, offering royalties of eight cents a
copy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who
was then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they
approached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of <em>Death Comes for the
Archbishop</em>, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.
The advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh
Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML
printings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies
(December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934),
5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the
ML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows:
14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910
copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).</p>
<p>After the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want
any of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked
Knopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of
the contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock
after the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf,
indicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September
25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so
much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do
is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH
COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It
seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather,
and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep
the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will
undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other
alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th
of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would
probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder
price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell
out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the
book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the
most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the
contract?</p>
<p>. . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give
up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett
and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to
renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss
Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to
say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from
her point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June
1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. <em>Death</em>
<em>Comes</em> <em>for</em> <em>the</em> <em>Archbishop</em> was listed in the ML’s spring 1937
catalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to
Eayrs, 28 May 1937).</p>
<p>In 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had
acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, published <em>Death Comes for the
Archbishop</em> in its paperback series Vintage Books.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Widely regarded as Willa Cather’s masterpiece, <em>Death Comes For The
Archbishop</em> is set in the mid-19th century. Two French
missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into
the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of
revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish
priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and
materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese,
knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father
indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the
padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men
stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe,
using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its
surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has
succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the
New Mexican way of life.</p>
<p>“There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly
quiet narrative. It is a severe, purely designed chalice of handbeaten
silver, filled to the brim with the white essential wine of
love. . . .” — <em>Saturday Review</em></p>

(*Spring\n> 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published\nSeptember 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.\n\nWilla Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to\ninclude in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright.\nCerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s *My\nÁntonia* or *The Song of the Lark*, offering royalties of eight cents a\ncopy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who\nwas then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they\napproached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of *Death Comes for the\nArchbishop*, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.\nThe advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh\nEayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML\nprintings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies\n(December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934),\n5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the\nML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows:\n14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910\ncopies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nAfter the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want\nany of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked\nKnopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of\nthe contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock\nafter the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf,\nindicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September\n25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:\n\n> In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so\n> much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do\n> is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH\n> COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It\n> seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather,\n> and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep\n> the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will\n> undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other\n> alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th\n> of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would\n> probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder\n> price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell\n> out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the\n> book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the\n> most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the\n> contract?\n>\n> . . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give\n> up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett\n> and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to\n> renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss\n> Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to\n> say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).\n\nKnopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from\nher point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June\n1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. *Death*\n*Comes* *for* *the* *Archbishop* was listed in the ML’s spring 1937\ncatalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to\nEayrs, 28 May 1937).\n\nIn 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had\nacquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, published *Death Comes for the\nArchbishop* in its paperback series Vintage Books.\n\n**219.2.** **Reissue format (1984)**\n\nWILLA CATHER | \\[2-line title in reverse within single rules in reverse\nall on black rectangular panel\\] DEATH COMES FOR | THE ARCHBISHOP |\n\\[below panel: torchbearer N\\] | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[*10*\\], \\[1–2\\] 3–299 \\[300–302\\].

Two French\n> missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into\n> the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of\n> revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish\n> priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and\n> materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese,\n> knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father\n> indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the\n> padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men\n> stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe,\n> using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its\n> surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has\n> succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the\n> New Mexican way of life.\n>\n> “There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly\n> quiet narrative. It is a severe, purely designed chalice of handbeaten\n> silver, filled to the brim with the white essential wine of\n> love. . . .” — *Saturday Review*\n\nNew bibliographical edition published by Knopf, 1945.
