<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig Lewisohn’s</span> “Up Stream” appeared
first in the Spring of 1922. The color and charm of the book and the
continuous beauty of its prose established it immediately as an
important and permanent contribution to American letters. The Modern
Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and
certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly
win a tremendous new audience for the book. (<em>Fall 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1922. The B&amp;L plates were too
large for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a
new typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.
<em>WR</em> 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1
January 1940.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Up Stream</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th
out of 147 ML titles.</p>
<p>Klopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New
York, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an
introduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like
to have your name among the people who have written introductions to our
volumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had
not liked <em>Up Stream</em> but would be willing to write an introduction to a
ML edition of Lewisohn’s <em>Israel</em> (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).
In the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.</p>
<p>Lewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He
informed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral
and literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not
too extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book
in such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to
Klopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his
marriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He
removed a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote
others. In the B&amp;L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his
fourth story to <em>Uncle Remus’s Magazine</em> for $125, Lewisohn wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.
My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and
I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in
Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows
Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the
dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&amp;L, p. 135; suspension
points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&amp;L and ML
texts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.
Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor
and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was
sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be
less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions
within me. . . .</p>
<p>We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I
think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I
tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her
family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to
be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was
perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was
absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor
true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a
middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older
than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .
Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under
. . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are
the following, with the page of the 1922 Boni &amp; Liveright edition given
first, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library
printing: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;
146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;
188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.</p>
<p>When Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of <em>Up Stream</em> she threatened
to sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:
“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor
and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked
Lewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for
including the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful
nuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will
all have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very
earliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).</p>

reset; the introduction is a page shorter than in 128a.</p>
<p>Two changes were made in the second printing in response to Mary
Lewisohn’s objections. The original B&amp;L text was substituted for the
passage on pp. 159–60 quoted above, and the following passage was
omitted from the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I say this in all humility and say it in order to record the fact that
the general texture of Up Stream remained free, has always been free,
of the unveracity that marked a small number of passages now changed
or expunged. Why, in my ardent search for the truth of things, did I
deliberately falsify <em>one</em> element in my life and draw falsely <em>one</em>
character? Through a mistaken kindliness? Yes. But more through
shame—shame of the all but unbelievable physical and moral
facts. . . . That blot on the book has now been wiped out. . . . If Up
Stream is still worthy of being read; if it is worthy of being
remembered—let it be read and remembered in the form in which it is
now definitively printed here. . . . (128a, p. xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>128b<sub>2</sub>. Second printing, second state with introduction cancelled (1927)</h4>

<p>Contents as 128b<sub>1</sub> except: [v]–[xii] cancelled.</p>
<p>Mary Lewisohn was not satisfied with the changes in the second printing.
On 29 November 1927, three days after the date of the second printing,
the ML agreed to substitute the original B&amp;L text for the revisions
supplied by Ludwig Lewisohn and to drop the introduction altogether. The
introduction was cancelled in remaining copies of the second printing.
The table of contents which listed the introduction is also cancelled in
all copies of 128b<sub>2</sub> examined.</p>

without the replacement leaf. It appears likely that 128c and 128c
variant are two states of the same printing, differing only in the
number of leaves in the final gathering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third printing (12 July 1928) inadvertently retained Lewisohn’s
introduction. The introduction was cancelled, apparently before any
copies were distributed, and the textual note required by the ML’s
agreement with Mary Lewisohn was inserted as a replacement leaf.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The original
text complete and unabridged, with a prologue by the author.” (<em>Spring
1929</em>) <em>Note:</em> The Prologue was not new to the ML edition; it had been
part of <em>Up Stream</em> since its original publication in 1922. The jacket
statement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the
introduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer
included.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative
life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. <em>Up Stream</em>
is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,
outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest
and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.
In the literature of America’s coming of age, <em>Up Stream</em> occupies a
unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final
declaration of creative independence. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the
ML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.
Lewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised <em>Up
Stream</em> for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after
those that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to
Ludwig Lewisohn in 1936 that <em>Up Stream</em> continued to sell at the rate
of 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time
that the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying
record” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).</p>
<p>Three other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. <em>A Modern Book of
Criticism</em> (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published
in spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. <em>The Story of
American Literature</em> (G43), originally published as <em>Expression in
America</em>, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to
lobby for the inclusion of his novel <em>The Island Within</em> shortly after
the Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the
series were “more than enough” but suggested that <em>Up Stream</em> might be
dropped and <em>The Island Within</em> published in its place. Lewisohn
approved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass
Canfield, Harper &amp; Bros., 12 October 1939). <em>The Island Within</em> (329)
sold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.</p>

The color and charm of the book and the\n> continuous beauty of its prose established it immediately as an\n> important and permanent contribution to American letters. The Modern\n> Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and\n> certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly\n> win a tremendous new audience for the book. (*Fall 1926*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.\n*WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1940.\n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th\nout of 147 ML titles.\n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New\nYork, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an\nintroduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like\nto have your name among the people who have written introductions to our\nvolumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had\nnot liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a\nML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).\nIn the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.\n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He\ninformed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral\nand literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not\ntoo extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book\nin such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to\nKlopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his\nmarriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He\nremoved a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote\nothers. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his\nfourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for $125, Lewisohn wrote:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and\n> I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in\n> Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows\n> Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the\n> dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension\n> points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML\n> texts).\n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\n> and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was\n> sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be\n> less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions\n> within me. . . .\n>\n> We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I\n> think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I\n> tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her\n> family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to\n> be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was\n> perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was\n> absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor\n> true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a\n> middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older\n> than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .\n> Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under\n> . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)\n\nA complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are\nthe following, with the page of the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition given\nfirst, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library\nprinting: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;\n146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;\n188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.\n\nWhen Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of *Up Stream* she threatened\nto sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:\n“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\nand her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked\nLewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for\nincluding the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful\nnuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will\nall have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very\nearliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).\n\n#### 128b<sub>1</sub>.

The original B&L text was substituted for the\npassage on pp. 159–60 quoted above, and the following passage was\nomitted from the introduction:\n\n> I say this in all humility and say it in order to record the fact that\n> the general texture of Up Stream remained free, has always been free,\n> of the unveracity that marked a small number of passages now changed\n> or expunged.

Cerf wrote to\nLudwig Lewisohn in 1936 that *Up Stream* continued to sell at the rate\nof 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time\nthat the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying\nrecord” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).\n\nThree other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. *A Modern Book of\nCriticism* (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published\nin spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. *The Story of\nAmerican Literature* (G43), originally published as *Expression in\nAmerica*, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to\nlobby for the inclusion of his novel *The Island Within* shortly after\nthe Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the\nseries were “more than enough” but suggested that *Up Stream* might be\ndropped and *The Island Within* published in its place. Lewisohn\napproved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass\nCanfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939). *The Island Within* (329)\nsold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewisohn, ed., *A Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75\n\nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43\n\nLewisohn, *The Island Within* (1940–1942) 329",

The color and charm of the book and the\n> continuous beauty of its prose established it immediately as an\n> important and permanent contribution to American letters. The Modern\n> Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and\n> certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly\n> win a tremendous new audience for the book. (*Fall 1926*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.\n*WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1940.\n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th\nout of 147 ML titles.\n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New\nYork, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an\nintroduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like\nto have your name among the people who have written introductions to our\nvolumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had\nnot liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a\nML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).\nIn the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.\n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He\ninformed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral\nand literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not\ntoo extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book\nin such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to\nKlopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his\nmarriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He\nremoved a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote\nothers. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his\nfourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for $125, Lewisohn wrote:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and\n> I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in\n> Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows\n> Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the\n> dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension\n> points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML\n> texts).\n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\n> and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was\n> sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be\n> less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions\n> within me. . . .\n>\n> We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I\n> think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I\n> tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her\n> family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to\n> be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was\n> perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was\n> absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor\n> true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a\n> middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older\n> than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .\n> Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under\n> . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)\n\nA complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are\nthe following, with the page of the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition given\nfirst, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library\nprinting: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;\n146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;\n188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.\n\nWhen Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of *Up Stream* she threatened\nto sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:\n“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\nand her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked\nLewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for\nincluding the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful\nnuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will\nall have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very\nearliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).\n\n"
