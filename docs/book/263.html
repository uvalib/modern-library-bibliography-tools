<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
With the publication of <em>Eminent Victorians</em> in 1918, the art of
biography was given a new impetus. The astonishing brilliance of
Lytton Strachey’s portraits illuminated the hidden facets of his
subjects as well as the motives and tendencies of the era in which
they lived. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s
graphic and vivacious methods, and the present-day enthusiasm for
biographical literature is directly traceable to his innovating
technique. Strachey himself considered <em>Eminent Victorians</em> his finest
work. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1918; publishing
rights and plates subsequently acquired by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. ML
edition printed from Harcourt, Brace plates made from a new typesetting.
Published November 1933. <em>WR</em> 9 December 1933. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace acquired the rights to <em>Eminent Victorians</em> after
publishing Strachey’s <em>Queen Victoria</em> (1921) and <em>Elizabeth and Essex</em>
(1928). When Cerf expressed interest in a Strachey title for the ML,
Alfred Harcourt replied that neither <em>Queen Victoria</em> nor <em>Elizabeth and
Essex</em> would be available since the firm wanted to promote them as
textbooks after a reprint contracts held by Blue Ribbon Books expired.
He indicated that the ML could have <em>Eminent Victorians</em> in June 1933
when the Star Dollar Books edition published by Garden City Publishing
Co. would be exhausted (Harcourt to Cerf, 27 September 1932). The
following April he reported that the Star edition was out of print and
that <em>Eminent Victorians</em> was available whenever the ML wanted it
(Harcourt to Cerf, 21 April 1933). The original plates were too large
for the ML’s format and Harcourt, Brace made new plates for the ML
edition, for which the ML was billed $500. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace
royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Eminent Victorians</em> sold 2,967 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
Before the publication of <em>Eminent Victorians</em> the art of biography
had fallen into a decline that made of most lives a journeyman’s
compilation of volumes commemorating the dead. To the task of putting
an end to this kind of literary abomination, Lytton Strachey brought
many special qualifications. Of these, the most notable were his acute
sense of the past, a scholarship both accurate and spirited, and a
vivid style. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s
graphic and vitalizing methods, and the current enthusiasm for works
of biography is directly traceable to his innovations. By unanimous
consent <em>Eminent Victorians</em> is his most noteworthy book. In it he
evaluates the lives and times of Cardinal Manning, Florence
Nightingale, Dr. Thomas Arnold of Rugby and General Charles George
(Chinese) Gordon. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>
