<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in dark bluish green (165) and black on cream paper
with stylized illustration of a face in left profile, a book, a skull,
and a figure riding a lion; borders in dark bluish green, lettering in

<p>Originally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1913, and from 1927
by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co. ML edition (201.1, pp. [<em>5</em>], [7]–484)
printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published October 1930. <em>WR</em> 8
November 1930. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p><em>Fortitude</em> was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML secured
reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library from Garden
City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of
12 cents a copy. Cerf told the press agent Lynn Farnol that Walpole
received the highest advance against royalties that the ML had ever paid
(Cerf to Farnol, 14 May 1941), but the amount was not indicated—and of
course the advance would have been paid to Doubleday, Doran, which would
have split it with Walpole.</p>
<p>Cerf was unhappy with the appearance of the first printing. The plates,
he told Doubleday, “are lousy, and we need some new ones” (Cerf to
Robert de Graff, Garden City Pub. Co., 5 November 1930). When he sent a
copy of the first printing to Walpole he apologized for its appearance
and indicated that Doubleday had promised to supply new plates for
subsequent printings (Cerf to Walpole, 26 November 1930).</p>
<p><em>Fortitude</em> was in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It was
not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> As 201.1. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the whole imposing list of novels written by Hugh Walpole there is
none that has reached and maintained the popularity of <em>Fortitude</em>.
The absorbing interest of its romantic story, its enthusiasm and its
conviction make of it a rare phenomenon among books in an epoch of
uncompromising realism. That it is Mr. Walpole’s favorite among all
his novels can be readily understood. He says of it: “<em>Fortitude</em> is a
romance—a fairy-tale about a young man who very naively believed in
almost everything.” (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. The
plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. First printing
from the new plates: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>All subsequent ML printings were from the new plates. The second and
third printings from these plates in September 1934 and April 1936 were
for 2,000 copies each. Sales declined significantly by the 1960s; 1967
sales were 600 copies.</p>

Signed: Loeffel. (*Fall 1930*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1913, and from 1927\nby Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition (201.1, pp. \\[*5*\\], \\[7\\]–484)\nprinted from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published October 1930. *WR* 8\nNovember 1930. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\n*Fortitude* was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML secured\nreprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library from Garden\nCity Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of\n12 cents a copy. Cerf told the press agent Lynn Farnol that Walpole\nreceived the highest advance against royalties that the ML had ever paid\n(Cerf to Farnol, 14 May 1941), but the amount was not indicated—and of\ncourse the advance would have been paid to Doubleday, Doran, which would\nhave split it with Walpole.\n\nCerf was unhappy with the appearance of the first printing. The plates,\nhe told Doubleday, “are lousy, and we need some new ones” (Cerf to\nRobert de Graff, Garden City Pub. Co., 5 November 1930). When he sent a\ncopy of the first printing to Walpole he apologized for its appearance\nand indicated that Doubleday had promised to supply new plates for\nsubsequent printings (Cerf to Walpole, 26 November 1930).\n\n*Fortitude* was in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It was\nnot among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the\n12-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 201.2a.

(*Spring 1931*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> In the whole imposing list of novels written by Hugh Walpole there is\n> none that has reached and maintained the popularity of *Fortitude*.\n> The absorbing interest of its romantic story, its enthusiasm and its\n> conviction make of it a rare phenomenon among books in an epoch of\n> uncompromising realism. That it is Mr. Walpole’s favorite among all\n> his novels can be readily understood. He says of it: “*Fortitude* is a\n> romance—a fairy-tale about a young man who very naively believed in\n> almost everything.” (*Fall 1934*)\n\nPrinted from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. The\nplates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. First printing\nfrom the new plates: 5,000 copies.\n\nAll subsequent ML printings were from the new plates. The second and\nthird printings from these plates in September 1934 and April 1936 were\nfor 2,000 copies each. Sales declined significantly by the 1960s; 1967\nsales were 600 copies.\n\n#### 201.2b.
