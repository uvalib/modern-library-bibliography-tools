<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The Day family has become a part of our national tradition, and life
without Father Day would be very nearly unthinkable. With him, it has
been a joy, and sometimes even a trial, but always an enriching and
heartwarming adventure. <em>Life with Father</em>, as a play, has broken
records for continuous performances, and has established itself as a
modern American classic. In book form, Clarence Day’s family album is
aglow with the spirit of what all of us like best to remember of our
own past. (<em>Spring 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1935. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>],
v–258) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for February
1944; published 17 March 1944. <em>WR</em> 25 November 1944. First printing:
7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf a $6,000 advance of which $2,254 remained unearned in
spring 1954. Sharp received $75 for the jacket. Freiman wrote him: “Our
one regret is that we cannot afford to pay you a fee closer to the true
value of your work” (R. A. Freiman to Sharp, 18 November 1943).</p>
<p>Lindsay and Crouse, the authors of the Foreword, had written the play
based on Day’s book. In November 1943 the play was beginning its fifth
year on Broadway; it eventually ran over seven years to become the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_longest-running_Broadway_shows">longest-running non-musical play on
Broadway</a>.</p>
<p>Competing with the ML edition was a reprint edition published in 1943 by
Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press.</p>

In book form, Clarence Day’s family album is\n> aglow with the spirit of what all of us like best to remember of our\n> own past. (*Spring 1944*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1935. ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\],\nv–258) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for February\n1944; published 17 March 1944. *WR* 25 November 1944. First printing:\n7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf a $6,000 advance of which $2,254 remained unearned in\nspring 1954. Sharp received $75 for the jacket. Freiman wrote him: “Our\none regret is that we cannot afford to pay you a fee closer to the true\nvalue of your work” (R. A. Freiman to Sharp, 18 November 1943).\n\nLindsay and Crouse, the authors of the Foreword, had written the play\nbased on Day’s book. In November 1943 the play was beginning its fifth\nyear on Broadway; it eventually ran over seven years to become the\n[longest-running non-musical play on\nBroadway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_longest-running_Broadway_shows).\n\nCompeting with the ML edition was a reprint edition published in 1943 by\nDoubleday’s Sun Dial Press.",

Signed: W.S. \\[William\nSharp\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The Day family has become a part of our national tradition, and life\n> without Father Day would be very nearly unthinkable. With him, it has\n> been a joy, and sometimes even a trial, but always an enriching and\n> heartwarming adventure. *Life with Father*, as a play, has broken\n> records for continuous performances, and has established itself as a\n> modern American classic. In book form, Clarence Day’s family album is\n> aglow with the spirit of what all of us like best to remember of our\n> own past. (*Spring 1944*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1935. ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\],\nv–258) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for February\n1944; published 17 March 1944. *WR* 25 November 1944. First printing:\n7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf a $6,000 advance of which $2,254 remained unearned in\nspring 1954. Sharp received $75 for the jacket. Freiman wrote him: “Our\none regret is that we cannot afford to pay you a fee closer to the true\nvalue of your work” (R. A. Freiman to Sharp, 18 November 1943).\n\nLindsay and Crouse, the authors of the Foreword, had written the play\nbased on Day’s book. In November 1943 the play was beginning its fifth\nyear on Broadway; it eventually ran over seven years to become the\n[longest-running non-musical play on\nBroadway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_longest-running_Broadway_shows).\n\nCompeting with the ML edition was a reprint edition published in 1943 by\nDoubleday’s Sun Dial Press."
