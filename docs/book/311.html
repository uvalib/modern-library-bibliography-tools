<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in dark greenish blue (174), dark grayish yellow
(91), and black on coated white paper with title in reverse against
large dark greenish blue panel, borders at top and bottom in dark
greenish blue, other lettering in black against smaller white panels
ruled in dark grayish yellow; spine in dark grayish yellow with
lettering in black. Three-line statement on front panel: “<em>A New
Masterpiece</em>” | <em>The strange and disturbing drama of</em> | <em>two men and a
woman</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Genuine compassion for his vagabonds and human flotsam gives the
breath of life to John Steinbeck’s novels and makes them idylls of the
lower depths. <em>Of Mice and Men</em> is Steinbeck at his compassionate
best; it is a story movingly and forcefully told and with overtones of
soaring beauty. Its first success as a national best-seller and its
subsequent triumph in dramatic form have helped to place John
Steinbeck in the company of the first prose writers of America.
(<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Covici, Friede, 1937, and subsequently by Viking
Press. ML edition (pp. [5]–186) printed from Covici, Friede/Viking
plates. Published February 1938. <em>WR</em> 5 March 1938. First printing: Not
ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer arranged the ML reprint with Covici, Friede, which had
been Steinbeck’s publisher since the publication of his fourth novel,
<em>Tortilla Flat</em>, in 1935*.* The close working relationship between
Steinbeck and his editor Pascal Covici was comparable to those between
F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway with Maxwell Perkins at Charles
Scribner’s Sons. Covici, Friede failed shortly after <em>Of Mice and Men</em>
appeared in the ML. The firm was acquired by Viking Press, Covici became
a Viking editor, and Steinbeck became a Viking author. Arrangements for
the second ML printing were made with Viking Press in October 1938.</p>
<p>There were four ML printings between October 1938 and September 1942
totaling 10,000 copies. Steinbeck’s first book with Viking Press, <em>The
Grapes of Wrath</em>, sold 430,000 copies in less than a year and was the
best-selling work of fiction for 1939 (Madison, pp. 306–7; Hackett and
Burke, p. 127).</p>
<p>When <em>Of Mice and Men</em> was published in the ML it had to compete with a
39-cent reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books. Lewis Miller, the Random
House sales manager, told one of the sales representatives: “Bennett
felt strongly that the book deserved a place in the Modern Library, no
matter what other editions were to be had” (Miller to Rosengren, 24
January 1938).</p>
<p><em>Of Mice and Men</em> sold 7,020 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles. Sales of all four Steinbeck titles in the ML totaled 35,975
copies during this period. <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> was the only Steinbeck
novel among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Of Mice and Men</em> is the beautiful and moving story of George Milton
and Lennie Small, who live—like the characters in <em>The Grapes of
Wrath</em>—on the fringes of American society. Sustained by the hope of
someday owning a farm of their own, these two itinerant laborers
arrive to work on a ranch in central California. George, who is
short-tempered, relies on Lennie’s great physical strength for
protection and in turn tries to keep his feeble-minded friend out of
trouble. But in the end, Lennie’s fundamental weakness leads to the
inevitable tragedy that Steinbeck so poignantly explores in this
spare, poetic novel.</p>
