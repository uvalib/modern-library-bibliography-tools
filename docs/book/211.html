<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Concededly the most important autobiography that has yet been written
in America, <em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> has exercised an enormous
influence upon a generation now coming into its full maturity. An
edition of one hundred copies, printed privately in 1907, had aroused
profound admiration among scholars. When it was published in 1918, it
immediately won and has since held an assured place among the
significant works in American literature. This chronicle of a
brilliant career and a constant spiritual quest is one of our great
national literary treasures. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), deep red (13) and
gold on coated white paper with inset portrait of a young Henry Adams in
deep red within a gold frame with city buildings outside frame at left
and right; borders in gold, title in reverse on front panel, other
lettering in deep red, all against vivid reddish orange background.
Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. Front flap as jacket A.
(<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
<p>Privately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade
edition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s
death. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927
and reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition
(pp. [v]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates.
Published March 1931. <em>WR</em> 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies.
Discontinued 1978/79.</p>
<p><em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> was one of the first titles Cerf tried to
get after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original
edition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a
reprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August
1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint.
Cerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of
the original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told
Houghton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be
taken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife,
Houghton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin
had reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It
will be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very
proud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).</p>
<p>He offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two
cents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for
nonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930;
Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf
did not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the
one-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin
reduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy
(Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s
to 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for
writing the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).</p>
<p>Scaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library
edition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the
plates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April
1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid
1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.</p>
<p>Later in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of <em>The
Education of Henry Adams</em> in the format of the new ML Giants series.
Around the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special
printing of Young’s <em>The Medici</em> in the same format that had been made
for Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of
the first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the
publisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500
each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”</p>
<p><em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> was the thirteenth best-selling ML title
during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It
sold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October
1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.
During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed
into the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782
copies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“Few books have had so unexpected success as <em>The Education of Henry
Adams</em>. Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one
hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author
declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He
bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical
Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first
published edition appeared. Although <em>The Education</em> had aroused a
deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one
of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great
popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best
sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant
works in American literature but among those which command a wide and
steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation,
the influence of the book is markedly increasing.” — from the
Introduction</p>

This chronicle of a\n> brilliant career and a constant spiritual quest is one of our great\n> national literary treasures. (*Spring 1936*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), deep red (13) and\ngold on coated white paper with inset portrait of a young Henry Adams in\ndeep red within a gold frame with city buildings outside frame at left\nand right; borders in gold, title in reverse on front panel, other\nlettering in deep red, all against vivid reddish orange background.\nDesigned by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. Front flap as jacket A.\n(*Spring 1938*)\n\nPrivately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade\nedition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s\ndeath. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927\nand reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates.\nPublished March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1978/79.\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was one of the first titles Cerf tried to\nget after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original\nedition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a\nreprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August\n1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint.\nCerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of\nthe original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told\nHoughton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be\ntaken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife,\nHoughton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin\nhad reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It\nwill be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very\nproud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).\n\nHe offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two\ncents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for\nnonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930;\nCerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf\ndid not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the\none-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin\nreduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s\nto 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for\nwriting the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).\n\nScaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library\nedition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the\nplates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April\n1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid\n1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.\n\nLater in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of *The\nEducation of Henry Adams* in the format of the new ML Giants series.\nAround the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special\nprinting of Young’s *The Medici* in the same format that had been made\nfor Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of\nthe first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the\npublisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500\neach and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was the thirteenth best-selling ML title\nduring the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It\nsold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October\n1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nDuring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed\ninto the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782\ncopies.\n\n#### 211b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nTHE EDUCATION | OF | HENRY ADAMS | BY HENRY ADAMS | INTRODUCTION BY |\nJAMES TRUSLOW ADAMS | \\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at\nleft\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–v\\] vi–x, \\[v\\] vi–x, \\[1–3\\] 4–517 \\[518–528\\].\n\\[1–17\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 211a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1918, | BY THE\nMASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY | COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE MODERN\nLIBRARY, INC.; \\[518\\] blank; \\[519–523\\] ML list; \\[524–525\\] ML Giants\nlist; \\[526–528\\] blank.

Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one\n> hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author\n> declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He\n> bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical\n> Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first\n> published edition appeared. Although *The Education* had aroused a\n> deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one\n> of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great\n> popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best\n> sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant\n> works in American literature but among those which command a wide and\n> steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation,\n> the influence of the book is markedly increasing.” — from the\n> Introduction"
