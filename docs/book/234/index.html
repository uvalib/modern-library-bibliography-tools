<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in grayish reddish orange (39) and black on cream

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> has earned a prominent place on the shelf
of the world’s greatest novels. Time does not lessen its appeal. The
years since its publication have witnessed a constantly renewing
enthusiasm for this heroic story of a woman victimized by an
implacable fate. The fate of the novel itself is the highest tribute
to its quality. In the beginning, <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> was
shunned and anathematized as immoral; now it is acknowledgedly one of
the outstanding literary achievements of the nineteenth century.
(<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in light green (144), moderate green (145) and
black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black and cream of a
man and woman on a stone bridge over stream; background in light green
with lettering in black and reverse, all within triple-rule frame in
moderate green. Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1938; unsigned. Front
flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1892. “New and
Completely Revised Edition” published 1893. ML edition (pp. [vii]–457)
printed from plates of the 1893 Harper edition with placement of
CONTENTS and the epigraph from Shakespeare reversed. Published March
1932. <em>WR</em> 16 April 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued
1971/72. Reissued 1979–86.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s a $2,000 advance. Royalties were paid on sales
rather than printings, but the rate has not been ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> sold 7,699 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML
and Giant titles. Hardy’s <em>Return of the Native</em> (126) outsold <em>Tess of
the D’Urbervilles</em> by about 30 copies. <em>The Mayor of Casterbridge</em> (17)
and <em>Jude the Obscure</em> (145) ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles.
<em>The Return of the Native</em> remained the ML’s best-selling Hardy title
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, ranking low
in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em>
and the other two Hardy titles were not among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular series during that period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Implacable fate plays a major role in the novels of Thomas Hardy. In
<em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine
and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim
and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy.
The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality
and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, <em>Tess
of the D’Urbervilles</em> was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is
acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last
decade of the nineteenth century. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bibliographical edition originally published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1920.
ML edition (pp. xxv–[xxxiv], [1] – [508]) printed from offset
plates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with
running heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s
Wessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular
ML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format,
1979–86.</p>
<p>When plans were made to publish <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> in MLCE,
Stein offered Weber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30
June 1950). Weber accepted but added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of
this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first
issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED
BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an
edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier
editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s
“Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent
reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text
for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what,
please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are
going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of
Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a
definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920
edition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport,
Tennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty
of 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML
format, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer.
The ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the
Harper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950).
The map was included at Weber’s suggestion.</p>

In\n> *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine\n> and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim\n> and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy.\n> The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality\n> and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, *Tess\n> of the D’Urbervilles* was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is\n> acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last\n> decade of the nineteenth century. (*Fall 1956*)\n\nBibliographical edition originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1920.\nML edition (pp. xxv–\\[xxxiv\\], \\[1\\] – \\[508\\]) printed from offset\nplates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with\nrunning heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s\nWessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular\nML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format,\n1979–86.\n\nWhen plans were made to publish *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* in MLCE,\nStein offered Weber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30\nJune 1950). Weber accepted but added:\n\n> I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of\n> this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first\n> issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED\n> BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an\n> edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier\n> editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s\n> “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent\n> reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text\n> for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what,\n> please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are\n> going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of\n> Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a\n> definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).\n\nStein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920\nedition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport,\nTennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty\nof 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML\nformat, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer.\nThe ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the\nHarper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950).\nThe map was included at Weber’s suggestion.\n\n#### 234.2b.
