D. Jacket title: THE SHORT STORIES OF ANTON TCHEKOV. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. <em>WR</em> 9
April 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. <em>The Stories of Anton
Tchekov</em> superseded Chekhov’s <em>Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories</em>
(27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision
of the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been
awaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short
Stories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to
scrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection
that we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected
with due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the
fourteen stories in <em>Rothschild’s Fiddle</em> were retained in Linscott’s
collection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).</p>
<p>The ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the
spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use
of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to <em>The Plays of Anton
Tchekov</em> (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of
that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to
“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of <em>Best Plays</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Stories of Anton Tchekov</em> sold 5,642 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth
of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.**232b. <em>Rothschild’s

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Supreme among the world’s short-story writers, Anton Tchekov is here
represented by twenty-two [<em>sic</em>] of his most characteristic tales.
For their range and variety, for their acuteness of observation and
for their simple humanity, these stories reveal the fullest powers of
his genius. Tchekov’s unfailing insight into the lives of ordinary
people, his ability to dramatize the most commonplace situations and
his gentle humor made him not only one of the greatest of short-story
writers but also one of the most beloved. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

(*Fall 1931*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9\nApril 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. *The Stories of Anton\nTchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories*\n(27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision\nof the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been\nawaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short\nStories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to\nscrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection\nthat we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected\nwith due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the\nfourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s\ncollection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).\n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the\nspelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use\nof “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton\nTchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of\nthat spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to\n“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.\n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth\nof the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.**232b. *Rothschild’s\nFiddle* added (1936?)**Title as 232a.Pp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–x, 1–448\n\\[449–454\\]. \\[1–14\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[15\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 232a except: \\[ii\\] pub. note A6; \\[iv\\] *First* statement\nomitted; 1–448 text; \\[449–453\\] ML list; \\[454\\] ML Giants list.\n(*Spring 1936*) *Note:* “Rothschild’s Fiddle” (in the R. E. C.
