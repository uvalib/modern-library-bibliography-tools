<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. <em>WR</em> 9 April 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>The Stories of Anton Tchekov</em> superseded Chekhov’s <em>Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories</em> (27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision of the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been awaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short Stories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to scrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection that we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected with due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the fourteen stories in <em>Rothschild’s Fiddle</em> were retained in Linscott’s collection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).</p>
<p>The ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to <em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em> (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to “Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of <em>Best Plays</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Stories of Anton Tchekov</em> sold 5,642 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Supreme among the world’s short-story writers, Anton Tchekov is here represented by twenty-two [<em>sic</em>] of his most characteristic tales. For their range and variety, for their acuteness of observation and for their simple humanity, these stories reveal the fullest powers of his genius. Tchekov’s unfailing insight into the lives of ordinary people, his ability to dramatize the most commonplace situations and his gentle humor made him not only one of the greatest of short-story writers but also one of the most beloved. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

(*Fall 1931*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9 April 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories* (27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision of the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been awaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short Stories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to scrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection that we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected with due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the fourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s collection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).  \n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to “Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.  \n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\n#### 232b. *Rothschild’s Fiddle* added (1936?)\n\nTitle as 232a.\n\nPp.

For their range and variety, for their acuteness of observation and for their simple humanity, these stories reveal the fullest powers of his genius. Tchekov’s unfailing insight into the lives of ordinary people, his ability to dramatize the most commonplace situations and his gentle humor made him not only one of the greatest of short-story writers but also one of the most beloved.

Eight of the fourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s collection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).  \n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to “Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.  \n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\n"

For their range and variety, for their acuteness of observation and for their simple humanity, these stories reveal the fullest powers of his genius. Tchekov’s unfailing insight into the lives of ordinary people, his ability to dramatize the most commonplace situations and his gentle humor made him not only one of the greatest of short-story writers but also one of the most beloved.
