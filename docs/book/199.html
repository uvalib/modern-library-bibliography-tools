<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The history of W. Somerset Maugham’s masterpiece is a significant
commentary on the changing and maturing taste in fiction. When it
appeared in 1915, a few discerning critics hailed it as one of the
first important novels of the twentieth century. For several years the
public remained apathetic and the book almost suffered the fate of the
casual novel. But its loyal champions fought to save it from oblivion.
Today, no more popular novel exists in the English language. It has
been one of the two best sellers in the entire Modern Library series
for the last three years. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except on coated light yellow (86) paper. (<em>Fall
1939</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1915, and from 1927
by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>]–766) printed from
Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. Published September
1930. <em>WR</em> 18 October 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four
long-sought Doubleday titles—<em>Of Human Bondage</em>, Walpole’s <em>Fortitude</em>
(201), Huxley’s <em>Point Counter Point</em> (203), and Bennett’s <em>Old Wives’
Tale</em> (207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden
City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a
$6,000 advance for <em>Of Human Bondage</em> and agreed to pay royalties of 12
cents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was
then paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’s <em>Twelve Men</em>
(159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January
1931. Doubleday’s new plates <em>Of Human Bondage</em> were originally intended
for the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden
City Publishing Co. around 1933.</p>
<p>In April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent
of the list price, which was then $2.45. Royalties on the Vintage
paperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a
$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the
total was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of $10,000 due on1
January 1969 and 1 January 1970.</p>
<p>In 1968 the ML considered transferring <em>Of Human Bondage</em> to the Giants
series, which would have involved photographing the book and making new
plates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.</p>
<p><em>Of Human Bondage</em> was one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It
ranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication
date, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH
box 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in
1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as
follows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and
11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not
calendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been
sold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf
to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the
18-month period May 1942–October 1943 <em>Of Human Bondage</em> sold 18,505
copies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the
fourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more
copies than Dostoyevsky’s <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (228), then the second
best-selling title in the regular series. By the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s best-selling title with sales
of 11,563 copies.</p>

(*Fall 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The history of W. Somerset Maugham’s masterpiece is a significant\n> commentary on the changing and maturing taste in fiction. When it\n> appeared in 1915, a few discerning critics hailed it as one of the\n> first important novels of the twentieth century. For several years the\n> public remained apathetic and the book almost suffered the fate of the\n> casual novel. But its loyal champions fought to save it from oblivion.\n> Today, no more popular novel exists in the English language. It has\n> been one of the two best sellers in the entire Modern Library series\n> for the last three years. (*Fall 1933*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except on coated light yellow (86) paper. (*Fall\n1939*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1915, and from 1927\nby Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\]–766) printed from\nDoubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. Published September\n1930. *WR* 18 October 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies.\n\nCerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four\nlong-sought Doubleday titles—*Of Human Bondage*, Walpole’s *Fortitude*\n(201), Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203), and Bennett’s *Old Wives’\nTale* (207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden\nCity Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a\n$6,000 advance for *Of Human Bondage* and agreed to pay royalties of 12\ncents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was\nthen paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men*\n(159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January\n1931. Doubleday’s new plates *Of Human Bondage* were originally intended\nfor the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden\nCity Publishing Co. around 1933.\n\nIn April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent\nof the list price, which was then $2.45. Royalties on the Vintage\npaperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a\n$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the\ntotal was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of $10,000 due on1\nJanuary 1969 and 1 January 1970.\n\nIn 1968 the ML considered transferring *Of Human Bondage* to the Giants\nseries, which would have involved photographing the book and making new\nplates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.\n\n*Of Human Bondage* was one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It\nranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication\ndate, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH\nbox 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in\n1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as\nfollows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and\n11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not\ncalendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been\nsold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf\nto Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the\n18-month period May 1942–October 1943 *Of Human Bondage* sold 18,505\ncopies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the\nfourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more\ncopies than Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228), then the second\nbest-selling title in the regular series. By the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s best-selling title with sales\nof 11,563 copies.\n\n#### 199.1b.
