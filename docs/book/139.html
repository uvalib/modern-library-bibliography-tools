<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Almost a quarter of a century has elapsed since this unique novel by
George Brown gained, owing to the critical insight of Andrew Lang,
rapid fame.</p>
<p>In what manner Brown might have developed, had he lived, and to what
heights he might have attained, are beyond conjecture. His book
reaches out to us with singular, doomed power. The terrible conclusion
gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no
beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the
author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself
subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country
superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous
existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green
Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of
the dawn!”</p>
<p>The editors of the Modern Library consider this novel one of the
finest in the entire series. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “A powerful,

<em>The Modern Library, Inc. takes pleasure in</em> | <em>presenting this edition
of “The House with</em> | <em>the Green Shutters” to the delegates to the</em> |
<em>American Booksellers’ Convention, and their</em> | <em>guests, at the banquet
at the Hotel Commodore,</em> | <em>New York, on May 12, 1927</em>.</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co., 1901, with the
author named as George Douglas. New bibliographical edition published by
Thomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by A. &amp; C. Boni, 1926. ML edition
(pp. [v], 1–314) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates. Publication
announced for April 1927. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000
copies. Discontinued 1 January 1931.</p>
<p>It is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published <em>The House with the Green
Shutters</em> under the author’s full name rather than his better-known
pseudonym George Douglas.</p>
<p>Seltzer described <em>The House with the Green Shutters</em> as follows: “. . .
this famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern
fiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young
Scotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first
book that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and
moods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were
equally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction
to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels
written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make
twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the
Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).</p>
<p>Broun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926)
but failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in
its place was originally written as an article for the British
periodical <em>John O’London’s Weekly</em> (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never
copyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at
the last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the
ML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the
introduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its
use. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter
of protest to <em>Saturday Review of Literature</em> (“A Writer’s Grievance,”
<em>SRL</em>, 10 September 1927, p. 110).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize <em>The House with
the Green Shutters</em>, including distributing a portion of the first
printing at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it
failed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of
8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second
printing of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it
might catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the
end of the year.</p>
