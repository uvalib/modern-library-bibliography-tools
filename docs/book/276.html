<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Maria Chapdelaine</em> is the kind of story on which the usual
publisher’s “blurb” would be strangely out of place. The original
publishers wisely issued it in a picture wrapper without a single word
of description, and let the public discover its beauties for itself.
Canadian in setting, this haunting story, written by a French
wanderer, has gone far beyond the boundaries of America, and has
become one of the treasures of the world’s narrative literature. Did
you enjoy <em>Green Mansions</em>? Try <em>Maria Chapdelaine</em>, then! (<em>Fall
1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blake translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co.,
1921, with large initials in blue at the beginning of each chapter.
Reprinted with drawings by Wilfred Jones, 1924, using the original text
plates and a second set of plates containing illustrations and different
large initials printed in grayish yellow. Reprinted with introduction
and notes by Carl Y. Connor in Macmillan’s Modern Readers’ Series, 1929,
with large initials from the illustrated edition added to the text
plates to allow for one-color printing and illustrations omitted. ML
edition (pp. [xix]–288) printed from Modern Readers’ Series plates
with Connor introduction and notes omitted. Published November 1934.
<em>WR</em> 1 December 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall
1950.</p>
<p>Klopfer offered 8 cents a copy for <em>Maria Chapedelaine</em> in 1926 with an
advance of $400 against the first 5,000 copies, but Macmillan was
planning to include it in their Modern Readers series (Klopfer to George
Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 5 October 1926). In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon
Phelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to
all of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we
could sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell
themselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML
paid Macmillan a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy
(Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was
president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada.</p>
<p>The ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used
for Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some
arrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML
edition in that format (David Mason, Fine &amp; Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN;
undated.)</p>
<p><em>Maria Chapdelaine</em> sold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title. In
1952, two years after the ML edition was discontinued, 3,494 copies were
remaindered through the Harlem Book Co.</p>

Discontinued fall\n1950.\n\nKlopfer offered 8 cents a copy for *Maria Chapedelaine* in 1926 with an\nadvance of $400 against the first 5,000 copies, but Macmillan was\nplanning to include it in their Modern Readers series (Klopfer to George\nBrett, Jr., Macmillan, 5 October 1926). In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon\nPhelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to\nall of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we\ncould sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell\nthemselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML\npaid Macmillan a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was\npresident of the Macmillan Co. of Canada.\n\nThe ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used\nfor Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some\narrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML\nedition in that format (David Mason, Fine & Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN;\nundated.)\n\n*Maria Chapdelaine* sold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title. In\n1952, two years after the ML edition was discontinued, 3,494 copies were\nremaindered through the Harlem Book Co.\n\n#### 276b.
