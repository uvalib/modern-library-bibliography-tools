<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The devotees of the novels of Joseph Conrad divide their enthusiasm
equally between <em>Victory</em> and <em>Lord Jim</em> (No. 186 in the Modern
Library). Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the World War,
<em>Victory</em> has steadily grown in prestige through almost a quarter of a
century. New readers come upon it as a rare discovery and old readers
return to it for the sheer enjoyment of its prose style and subtle
characterization. <em>Victory</em> represents Joseph Conrad at the apex of
his story-telling powers. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1915. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new Doubleday, Doran typesetting; the
plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published June
1932. <em>WR</em> 2 July 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>Cerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to <em>Victory</em>.
In 1928 he offered an advance of $3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a
royalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to
Nelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do
appreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is
unwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21
December 1928). <em>Victory</em> was included in the Sun Dial Library published
by Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that
specialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial
Library in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title
included in the series. <em>Victory</em> was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial
Library titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500
advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Victory</em> sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant
titles. <em>Lord Jim</em> (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales
of <em>Victory</em> totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad
was one of the ML’s best-selling authors. <em>Victory</em> sold 7,966 copies
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the
twelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. <em>Lord Jim</em> was the eighth
best-selling title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War,
<em>Victory</em> was immediately acclaimed the work of a master. It has grown
steadily in the estimation of a new generation of readers who have
come upon it as a rare discovery. Older readers go back to it for the
sheer pleasure of its graceful prose and its subtleties of
characterization. <em>Victory</em> is one of the novels by which Joseph
Conrad achieved the fullest measure of his gifts as story-teller. It
vies for favor with <em>Lord Jim</em> (No. 186), <em>Nostromo</em> (No. 275) and
<em>Heart of Darkness</em> (in <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em>, No. 168).
(<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in moderate yellow (87), strong green (141),
strong bluish green (160) and black on coated white paper depicting palm
trees and two birds in flight against strong bluish green sea and
