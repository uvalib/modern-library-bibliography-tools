<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The figure of William Blake, poet and prophet, visionary and romantic,
exerts a perennial fascination for all lovers of literature. Now, to
join its ever-growing representation of the great English poets, the
Modern Library makes available a distinguished volume of Blake’s work,
including some of his illustrations, chosen by Northrop Frye of the
University of Toronto. In addition to selections from the lyrics and
shorter poems, from the “prophetic books” such as <em>The Four Zoas</em>,
<em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>, there is a generous section of prose which
includes letters and some epigrammatic and revealing marginalia.
Professor Frye’s Introduction provides a commentary which illuminates
both the simplicity of the lyrics and the difficult but consistent
symbolism of the prophecies. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication originally announced for spring
1953; published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1953. First printing: 6,000
copies. Discontinued 1973/74; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>“The definitive edition is that of Geoffrey Keynes, <em>The Writings of
William Blake</em> (3 vols., 1925), reprinted in one volume as <em>The Poetry
and Prose of William Blake</em> (4th ed., 1948). The present text, with some
rearrangement, reproduces Keynes’s text” (p. xxx).</p>
<p>Frye received a flat fee of $350 for writing the introduction and
selecting the contents (Stein to Frye, 16 May 1952; 29 May 1952).</p>
<p>Frye made a series of extracts from <em>The Four Zoas</em>, <em>Milton</em>, and
<em>Jerusalem</em>. He told Stein, “I have a strong personal repugnance to
bits-and-pieces anthologizing, and do this only because I don’t at the
moment see anything better to do” (Frye to Stein, 27 September 1952). So
little of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get
it all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the
shorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early
prose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they
belonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia
were included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye
to Stein, 5 December 1952). Frye suggested the inclusion of the
illustrations (Frye to Stein, 9 June 1952). The original plan was to use
ten illustrations, but the number was reduced to eight so they could be
bound in as a four-leaf gathering.</p>

So\nlittle of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get\nit all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the\nshorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early\nprose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they\nbelonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia\nwere included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye\nto Stein, 5 December 1952).
