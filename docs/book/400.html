<p>Front flap:<br>
The 1930 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature is now represented
in the Modern Library series by three novels. The first two
(<em>Arrowsmith</em> No. 42 and <em>Babbitt</em> No. 162) have maintained, year
after year, a commanding place among the most popular books on the
list. Now <em>Dodsworth</em>, Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate
in search of escape from the tensions of industrialism and in revolt
against European patronage of America, is given permanence among the
best of the world’s best books. Clifton Fadiman contributes a
sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his Foreword. (<em>Fall
1947</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape
from the tensions of his own industrial empire and in revolt against
the patronizing attitudes of Europeans toward Americans is one of his
most enduring novels. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature
in 1930 is nowhere so critical of his own countrymen and nowhere so
proud of their genuine attainments. In this respect <em>Dodsworth</em> is a
novel of protest and yet of irony; it represents Sinclair Lewis at his
best as an observer and as a satirist. Clifton Fadiman contributes a
perceptive and sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his
Foreword. (<em>Spring 1962</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1929. ML edition (pp.
1–377) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1947. <em>WR</em> 10
January 1948. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>After following his editor, Harry Maule, from Doubleday to Random House,
Lewis expressed the hope that <em>Dodsworth</em> could be added to the ML
alongside <em>Arrowsmith</em> (254) and <em>Babbitt</em> (348). The ML tried to secure
reprint rights in 1941, but negotiations with Harcourt, Brace were
unsuccessful. Lewis then suggested <em>Elmer</em> <em>Gantry</em>, which apparently
would have been available, but Cerf thought that any of his major works
would be preferable (Lewis to Maule, 26 June 1941; Maule memo to Cerf,
27 June 1941; Maule to Lewis, 8 July 1941). Five years later Cerf
approached Harcourt, Brace again, pointing out that Lewis was anxious to
have <em>Dodsworth</em> in the series (Cerf to Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace,
6 September 1946). This time he was successful, and the ML secured U.S.
and Canadian reprint rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Lewis’ study of a Midwestern automobile magnate abroad ranks, with
<em>Main Street</em>, <em>Babbitt</em>, and <em>Arrowsmith</em>, as a classic of American
realism. These earlier novels exposed a narrow, provincial,
materialist America—and cries of outrage did not prevent Lewis’
Zenith, his Babbitts and Gantrys, from becoming part of the American
language and consciousness.</p>
<p>In <em>Dodsworth</em> he explores possibilities for regeneration and growth.
Samuel Dodsworth, perhaps the most sympathetic character to emerge
from Zenith, makes, with his wife, the time-honored pilgrimage to
Europe—and what was intended as a vacation becomes a forced
examination of a life too narrowly lived, of a marriage too fragile to
sustain the pressures and temptations of a year’s leisure. Dodsworth’s
honesty and his courage throughout his ordeal allow him to survive and
to grow—and in this last of Lewis’ pre-Depression novels, satire is
balanced by a cautious optimism.</p>

Now *Dodsworth*, Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate\n> in search of escape from the tensions of industrialism and in revolt\n> against European patronage of America, is given permanence among the\n> best of the world’s best books.

(*Fall\n> 1947*)\n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br>\n> Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape\n> from the tensions of his own industrial empire and in revolt against\n> the patronizing attitudes of Europeans toward Americans is one of his\n> most enduring novels. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature\n> in 1930 is nowhere so critical of his own countrymen and nowhere so\n> proud of their genuine attainments. In this respect *Dodsworth* is a\n> novel of protest and yet of irony; it represents Sinclair Lewis at his\n> best as an observer and as a satirist. Clifton Fadiman contributes a\n> perceptive and sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his\n> Foreword. (*Spring 1962*)\n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp.\n1–377) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1947. *WR* 10\nJanuary 1948. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nAfter following his editor, Harry Maule, from Doubleday to Random House,\nLewis expressed the hope that *Dodsworth* could be added to the ML\nalongside *Arrowsmith* (254) and *Babbitt* (348). The ML tried to secure\nreprint rights in 1941, but negotiations with Harcourt, Brace were\nunsuccessful. Lewis then suggested *Elmer* *Gantry*, which apparently\nwould have been available, but Cerf thought that any of his major works\nwould be preferable (Lewis to Maule, 26 June 1941; Maule memo to Cerf,\n27 June 1941; Maule to Lewis, 8 July 1941). Five years later Cerf\napproached Harcourt, Brace again, pointing out that Lewis was anxious to\nhave *Dodsworth* in the series (Cerf to Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace,\n6 September 1946). This time he was successful, and the ML secured U.S.\nand Canadian reprint rights.\n\n#### 400b.

These earlier novels exposed a narrow, provincial,\n> materialist America—and cries of outrage did not prevent Lewis’\n> Zenith, his Babbitts and Gantrys, from becoming part of the American\n> language and consciousness.\n>\n> In *Dodsworth* he explores possibilities for regeneration and growth.\n> Samuel Dodsworth, perhaps the most sympathetic character to emerge\n> from Zenith, makes, with his wife, the time-honored pilgrimage to\n> Europe—and what was intended as a vacation becomes a forced\n> examination of a life too narrowly lived, of a marriage too fragile to\n> sustain the pressures and temptations of a year’s leisure. Dodsworth’s\n> honesty and his courage throughout his ordeal allow him to survive and\n> to grow—and in this last of Lewis’ pre-Depression novels, satire is\n> balanced by a cautious optimism.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933– ) 254\n\nSinclair Lewis, *Babbitt* (1942– ) 348\n\nSinclair Lewis, *Cass Timberlane* (1957– ) 499",
