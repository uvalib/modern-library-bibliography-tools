<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The nationwide revival of interest in the works of America’s pioneer
realistic novelist prompts the editors of the Modern Library to make
William Dean Howells’ most celebrated book available to contemporary
readers. Written in 1885, <em>The Rise of Silas Lapham</em> was then hailed
as the first study of the native self-made businessman. It traced a
new phenomenon in our national life during the years following the
Civil War and portrayed the ferocity of the struggle for social
recognition and acceptance. With the passage of more than a half
century, this novel still reflects an era in America’s development and
now offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on our national character.
(<em>Fall 1951</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket A2:</em> As jacket A on coated white paper with upper panel in
brilliant blue (177) and lower panel in strong yellow green (117).
(<em>Early 1960s</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Ticknor &amp; Co., 1885, and subsequently by
Houghton, Mifflin. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published fall 1951. <em>WR</em> 10 November 1951. First printing:
6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in <em>The Rise of Silas Lapham</em> in 1937,
when he asked if the ML could reprint it using the plates of Houghton,
Mifflin’s Centenary Edition (Cerf to Robert Linscott, Houghton, Mifflin,
18 October 1937). Linscott replied that it could not be released to the
ML because Houghton, Mifflin had just published a new edition printed
from new plates.</p>
<p>Stein initially approached Alfred Kazin about writing the introduction,
offering him $150 (Stein to Kazin, 26 June 1950). Kazin declined but
expressed interest in <em>Charterhouse of Parma</em>; Stein indicated that if
Stendhal’s novel were added to MLCE the introduction would be reserved
for him (Stein to Kazin, 21 July 1950). He then asked Jacques Barzun,
increasing the fee to $200. Barzun declined on the grounds that he was
not equipped to do Howells justice (Stein to Barzun, 4 August 1950;
Barzun to Stein, 9 August 1950). Stein succeeded on his third attempt.
Clark received $200 for the introduction (Stein to Clark, 14 August
1950).</p>
<p>The official publication date as indicated in review copies was 25
September 1951. Sheets of the first printing were not received for
binding until 4 October, so copies were probably not ready for
distribution until later in October.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Written in 1885, Howells’ story of the rise of a newly rich, socially
aspiring family is generally regarded as the pioneer novel of American
realism. Rejecting the symbolism of Melville and Hawthorne, and the
false sentimentality of popular novels, Howells defined realism as
“nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material
. . . fidelity to experience and probability of motive.” In this
light, he examines the Laphams’ response to the ethical problems posed
by economic expansion, their conflicts with an admired and resented
Boston aristocracy, and, to give a balanced view of the Laphams’
world, delves into the fields of finance, architecture, and even the
details of mineral paint production. This novel still reflects an era
in America’s development and offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on
our national character.</p>

Linscott replied that it could not be released to the\nML because Houghton, Mifflin had just published a new edition printed\nfrom new plates.\n\nStein initially approached Alfred Kazin about writing the introduction,\noffering him $150 (Stein to Kazin, 26 June 1950). Kazin declined but\nexpressed interest in *Charterhouse of Parma*; Stein indicated that if\nStendhal’s novel were added to MLCE the introduction would be reserved\nfor him (Stein to Kazin, 21 July 1950). He then asked Jacques Barzun,\nincreasing the fee to $200. Barzun declined on the grounds that he was\nnot equipped to do Howells justice (Stein to Barzun, 4 August 1950;\nBarzun to Stein, 9 August 1950). Stein succeeded on his third attempt.\nClark received $200 for the introduction (Stein to Clark, 14 August\n1950).\n\nThe official publication date as indicated in review copies was 25\nSeptember 1951.
