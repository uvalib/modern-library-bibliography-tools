<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> Conrad Aiken was guided in his selections for this volume by the principle that American poetry has reached the maturity and dignity of the poetry of older countries. With this conviction firmly in mind, he could afford to eliminate some of the stodgy old bards and make place for the refreshing and vital work of the poets who have arisen during the last quarter century. Besides being representative, this anthology has the merit of being always on the side of excellence as against sentimentality and mediocrity. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Aiken’s anthology ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 bestselling ML titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten: <br> In revising this volume, Conrad Aiken was guided in his selections by the principle that American poetry has reached the maturity and dignity of the poetry of older countries. With this conviction in mind, he could eliminate some of the stand-bys of older anthologies and make place for the refreshing and vital work of the poets who have arisen in the quarter of a century between the two world wars. This anthology offers the work of the best American poets from the time of the Revolution to the present day. (<em>Spring 1945</em>) <em>Note:</em></p>

<p>Published February 1945. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1978/79. <em>Note:</em> The copyright date is 1944, but publication of <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry</em> appears to have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper shortages.</p>
<p><em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> also comprised the American portion of the ML Giant, <em>An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry</em> (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s insistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra Pound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was later returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf ignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve omitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been “overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include a single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was focused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any suggestion of purging Pound from <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> or <em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> (137.2), both of which were published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s poems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the 1947 printing (see G68).</p>
<p>Since the regular ML edition of <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from different type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two formats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of the two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of the Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books are printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point size. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the headline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type pages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the Giant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page, but there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the regular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries, indexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular edition and 420 pages in the Giant.</p>
<p><em>American Poetry 1671</em>–<em>1928</em> and <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American poet. These and other African American poets had been represented in <em>An Anthology of American Negro Literature</em> (183), edited by V. F. Calverton and published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s anthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> appeared in 1945. The revised edition of <em>An Anthology of American Negro Literature</em> (372), edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and 1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies” edited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice M. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of Calverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have occurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets from his anthology.</p>

With this conviction in mind, he could eliminate some of the stand-bys of older anthologies and make place for the refreshing and vital work of the poets who have arisen in the quarter of a century between the two world wars. This anthology offers the work of the best American poets from the time of the Revolution to the present day. (*Spring 1945*) *Note:* \n\n> Front flap reset in sans serif type from the flap text of 169.1a. It is not known if the reversion to the earlier text was deliberate or accidental. (*Fall 1953*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* As 169.1b on coated white paper with dark purplish red (259) replacing dark gray and strong purplish red (255) replacing dark brown. \n\n> Front flap as 169.1a. (*Fall 1964*)  \n\nPublished February 1945. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1978/79. *Note:* The copyright date is 1944, but publication of *A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry* appears to have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper shortages.  \n\n*A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* also comprised the American portion of the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s insistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra Pound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was later returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf ignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve omitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been “overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include a single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was focused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any suggestion of purging Pound from *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* or *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (137.2), both of which were published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s poems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the 1947 printing (see G68).  \n\nSince the regular ML edition of *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from different type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two formats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of the two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of the Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books are printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point size. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the headline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type pages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the Giant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page, but there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the regular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries, indexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular edition and 420 pages in the Giant.  \n\n*American Poetry 1671*–*1928* and *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American poet. These and other African American poets had been represented in *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183), edited by V. F. Calverton and published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s anthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* appeared in 1945.

Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and 1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies” edited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice M. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of Calverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have occurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets from his anthology.  \n\n#### 169.2b.
