<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Lafcadio Hearn was one of the very few white men who ever entered with
real sympathy into the viewpoint of the East. As much as it was
possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an
Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly
authoritative note.</p>
<p>“In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to
incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese
legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and
mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the
marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black
lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”.
(<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy
with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of
Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the
reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and
pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes
plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his
spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

As much as it was\n> possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an\n> Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly\n> authoritative note.\n>\n> “In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to\n> incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese\n> legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and\n> mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the\n> marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black\n> lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”.\n> (*Spring 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy\n> with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of\n> Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the\n> reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and\n> pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes\n> plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his\n> spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Roberts Brothers, 1887. New bibliographical\nedition published by Little, Brown & Co., 1906.

First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1939.\n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 7 cents a copy. Initial sales\nwere good and a second printing of 3,000 copies was made in December\n1927. The third and fourth printings for 1,000 copies each were\ncompleted in December 1930 and November 1931.\n\n*Some Chinese Ghosts* sold 1,119 copies during the six-month period\nJanuary–June 1928, placing it ninety-ninth out of 147 ML titles.\n\nThere was a final printing of jacket B in spring 1939 after the ML\nedition was discontinued.
