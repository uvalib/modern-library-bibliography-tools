<p>Front flap:<br>
To bring within the compass of a Modern Library volume of more than
650 [±700] pages the essential thought of the “Prince of Scholastics
and Doctor of the Church” is a notable contribution to philosophy,
religion and education. Designed to meet the needs of students and
general readers alike, this book offers St. Thomas’s teachings on God,
Creation, Man, Law, Grace, Habit, Virtue and kindred subjects, derived
from the <em>Summa Theologica</em> and the <em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em>. The
selections and the illuminating Introduction are by Anton C. Pegis,
President of The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. (<em>Spring
1948; [Spring 1956]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A on coated white paper with strong orange yellow
(68) instead of medium gray and vivid yellowish green (129) instead of
strong red. (<em>Fall 1963</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML collection derived from <em>Basic Writings of St. Thomas
Aquinas</em>, edited by Anton C. Pegis (2 vols., Random House, 1945).
Published spring 1948. <em>WR</em> 5 June 1948. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Pegis states in the Preface: “The present volume represents selections
of materials, drawn entirely from <em>Basic Writings of St. Thomas
Aquinas</em>, which Random House published in 1945. . . . I have not made my
selections with an eye to the opinions of specialists; I have aimed at
meeting what seemed to me the needs of the college student who is a
beginner in St. Thomas. Such a student will find in this book St.
Thomas’ mature views of the most crucial questions of natural theology,
psychology, theory of knowledge and ethics” (p. vii).</p>
<p><em>Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas</em> was widely adopted in Catholic
colleges as a textbook for philosophy courses, and it became one of the
ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952 it sold 11,129 copies, making it the second
best-selling title in the series and one of five ML titles with annual
sales exceeding 10,000 copies. Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (199) outsold
Aquinas by 434 copies; <em>Introduction to Aristotle</em> (396) trailed Aquinas
by fifteen copies. Pegis later indicated that <em>Introduction to St.
Thomas Aquinas</em> consistently sold 15,000–18,000 copies a year and had
become “unexpectedly a textbook. . . . No one planned it this way, and
certainly no one anticipated such an unusual eventuality. But, what is
worse, the <em>Introduction</em> is an improperly organized textbook since it
was never edited with such a teaching purpose in view; it was simply
organized as a representative collection of Thomistic readings from
<em>Basic Writings</em>. As a textbook, the <em>Introduction</em> needs a wider range
of selections, introductions in the fields of instruction involved,
notes, bibliographies and both subject and author indices” (Pegis to
Klopfer, 21 June 1963).</p>
<p>Pegis suggested a revised edition prepared specifically for the textbook
market as early as 1951. Part of his concern seems to have been to
secure better financial terms for himself, but no one at Random House
wanted to take such a successful title out of the ML (Klopfer to Pegis,
5 December 1951). Pegis was still talking about a textbook edition in
1963. At that time he noted that the market would be expanding sharply
as the baby boom generation entered Catholic colleges and proposed
turning <em>Introduction to Aquinas</em> into a textbook selling at five or six
dollars with a normal royalty of 10 to 15 percent of the list price. He
also offered to prepare a shorter and more general volume titled <em>The
Aquinas Papers</em> to replace <em>Introduction to Aquinas</em> in the ML (Pegis to
Klopfer, 21 June 1963).</p>
<p>Epstein saw no point in scrapping the ML’s plates for <em>Introduction to
Aquinas</em> (Epstein memo to Klopfer, 14 August 1963). Pegis then suggested
raising the list price from $1.95 to $2.45 and increasing his royalty to
10 percent (Pegis to Klopfer, 27 August 1963). Epstein countered with an
offer of a 5 percent royalty based on a list price of $2.45—the retail
price of ML books was in the process of increasing to $2.45 in any
case—and Pegis accepted (Pegis to Klopfer, 10 October 1963).</p>

(*Fall 1963*)\n\nOriginal ML collection derived from *Basic Writings of St. Thomas\nAquinas*, edited by Anton C. Pegis (2 vols., Random House, 1945).\nPublished spring 1948. *WR* 5 June 1948. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.\n\nPegis states in the Preface: “The present volume represents selections\nof materials, drawn entirely from *Basic Writings of St. Thomas\nAquinas*, which Random House published in 1945. . . . I have not made my\nselections with an eye to the opinions of specialists; I have aimed at\nmeeting what seemed to me the needs of the college student who is a\nbeginner in St. Thomas. Such a student will find in this book St.\nThomas’ mature views of the most crucial questions of natural theology,\npsychology, theory of knowledge and ethics” (p. vii).\n\n*Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas* was widely adopted in Catholic\ncolleges as a textbook for philosophy courses, and it became one of the\nML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952 it sold 11,129 copies, making it the second\nbest-selling title in the series and one of five ML titles with annual\nsales exceeding 10,000 copies. Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199) outsold\nAquinas by 434 copies; *Introduction to Aristotle* (396) trailed Aquinas\nby fifteen copies. Pegis later indicated that *Introduction to St.\nThomas Aquinas* consistently sold 15,000–18,000 copies a year and had\nbecome “unexpectedly a textbook. . . . No one planned it this way, and\ncertainly no one anticipated such an unusual eventuality. But, what is\nworse, the *Introduction* is an improperly organized textbook since it\nwas never edited with such a teaching purpose in view; it was simply\norganized as a representative collection of Thomistic readings from\n*Basic Writings*. As a textbook, the *Introduction* needs a wider range\nof selections, introductions in the fields of instruction involved,\nnotes, bibliographies and both subject and author indices” (Pegis to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963).\n\nPegis suggested a revised edition prepared specifically for the textbook\nmarket as early as 1951. Part of his concern seems to have been to\nsecure better financial terms for himself, but no one at Random House\nwanted to take such a successful title out of the ML (Klopfer to Pegis,\n5 December 1951). Pegis was still talking about a textbook edition in\n1963. At that time he noted that the market would be expanding sharply\nas the baby boom generation entered Catholic colleges and proposed\nturning *Introduction to Aquinas* into a textbook selling at five or six\ndollars with a normal royalty of 10 to 15 percent of the list price. He\nalso offered to prepare a shorter and more general volume titled *The\nAquinas Papers* to replace *Introduction to Aquinas* in the ML (Pegis to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963).\n\nEpstein saw no point in scrapping the ML’s plates for *Introduction to\nAquinas* (Epstein memo to Klopfer, 14 August 1963). Pegis then suggested\nraising the list price from $1.95 to $2.45 and increasing his royalty to\n10 percent (Pegis to Klopfer, 27 August 1963). Epstein countered with an\noffer of a 5 percent royalty based on a list price of $2.45—the retail\nprice of ML books was in the process of increasing to $2.45 in any\ncase—and Pegis accepted (Pegis to Klopfer, 10 October 1963).",
