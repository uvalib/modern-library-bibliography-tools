<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This book is guaranteed to give you all fifty-seven varieties of
laughter—everything from the side-splitting belly-laugh to the soft
inner ripple.</p>
<p>These stories are all about Jeeves, the most fabulous gentleman’s
gentleman ever invented. From behind his inscrutable facade, the
incomparable Jeeves—confessor, savior, confidant—sagely guides the
destinies of Bertie Wooster and his friends. And when things get out
of hand, as they invariably do, it is Jeeves who tactfully assumes
control to settle matters with his customary incredible ingenuity.</p>
<p>For this edition, John W. Aldridge has written an excellent
introduction which discusses Wodehouse’s talent—a talent that
transforms all readers into devotees. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection selected from <em>Carry On, Jeeves!</em> (George H.
Doran Co., 1927) and <em>Very Good, Jeeves</em> (Doran, 1930). Published
October 1958. <em>WR</em> 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Aldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to
Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be
making new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that
it would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to
Aldridge, 19 July 1957).</p>
<p>Wodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he
would be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in <em>Carry
On, Jeeves!</em> were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML
used most of the first Jeeves book and all of <em>Very Good, Jeeves</em>. He
also suggested updating several references in the stories and changing
the title to <em>A Gathering of Jeeves</em> (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August
1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked
Wodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that
he weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that
for Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also
asked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories.
“Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period
and . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary
confusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent
admirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title <em>Selected
Stories</em>. “The latter [<em>A Gathering of Jeeves</em>] may sound a little bit
better, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell
best when they state very clearly what the book contains, without
reaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August
1957).</p>
<p>Wodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s
introduction was written for the ML but also appeared in <em>New World
Writing</em>, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92.</p>

Aldridge has written an excellent\n> introduction which discusses Wodehouse’s talent—a talent that\n> transforms all readers into devotees. (*Fall 1958*)\n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Carry On, Jeeves!* (George H.\nDoran Co., 1927) and *Very Good, Jeeves* (Doran, 1930). Published\nOctober 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nAldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to\nHiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be\nmaking new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that\nit would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to\nAldridge, 19 July 1957).\n\nWodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he\nwould be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in *Carry\nOn, Jeeves!* were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML\nused most of the first Jeeves book and all of *Very Good, Jeeves*. He\nalso suggested updating several references in the stories and changing\nthe title to *A Gathering of Jeeves* (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August\n1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked\nWodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that\nhe weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that\nfor Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also\nasked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories.\n“Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period\nand . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary\nconfusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent\nadmirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title *Selected\nStories*. “The latter \\[*A Gathering of Jeeves*\\] may sound a little bit\nbetter, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell\nbest when they state very clearly what the book contains, without\nreaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August\n1957).\n\nWodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s\nintroduction was written for the ML but also appeared in *New World\nWriting*, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92.",
