<p><em>Endpapers:</em> Pictorial endpapers by Kent headed: Chart of the entrance
to RESVRRECTION BAY, ALASKA, Kenai Peninsula. Photographically reduced
from the endpapers of the Putnam edition. <em>Wilderness</em> was the second ML
title to appear in balloon cloth binding C without Kent’s grapevine
design on the spine of the binding (see “Binding” in the introductory
matter to 1930 entries).</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper
depicting a man and boy looming above the horizon; borders in black,
lettering in deep reddish orange. Designed by Kent; unsigned. (<em>Fall
1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
More than a record of an adventure in solitude, <em>Wilderness</em> is a book
that re-creates the wonder and the tranquillity of an untracked world.
The hand and heart and mind of a distinguished artist combine, in
prose and pictures, to convey the topography and the moods, the
changing vistas and the dramatic silences of the sub-Arctic region.
Rockwell Kent’s text, embellished by more than fifty pictures from his
pen, has the excitement of a quest that attains the nearest paradise
man can hope for on earth. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1920, in a volume measuring
approximately 11½ x 8 in. (280 x 200 mm). ML edition printed from plates
made from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the
original introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second
Preface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. [v] of the Putnam
edition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in
the volume. Published December 1930. <em>WR</em> 27 December 1930. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.</p>
<p>The Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The
announcement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition,
Rockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important
revisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations
that appear in the six dollar edition” (<em>PW</em> 118, 16 August 1930, p.
574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored
“two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in
the fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently
would not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go
so quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear
under the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Guter Mond, du gehst so stille</p>
<p>Durch die Abend Wolken hin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s
smaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the
Putnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by
about a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all
of the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the
title page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam
binding.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to
Angus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint
rights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized $1.49 reprint
published by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was
planning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not
consulted about the $1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of
the ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2
June 1939). Kent bought 240 copies of the discontinued ML edition at
twenty-five cents each (Kent to Cerf, 8 June 1939).</p>

Photographically reduced\nfrom the endpapers of the Putnam edition. *Wilderness* was the second ML\ntitle to appear in balloon cloth binding C without Kent’s grapevine\ndesign on the spine of the binding (see “Binding” in the introductory\nmatter to 1930 entries).\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper\ndepicting a man and boy looming above the horizon; borders in black,\nlettering in deep reddish orange. Designed by Kent; unsigned. (*Fall\n1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> More than a record of an adventure in solitude, *Wilderness* is a book\n> that re-creates the wonder and the tranquillity of an untracked world.\n> The hand and heart and mind of a distinguished artist combine, in\n> prose and pictures, to convey the topography and the moods, the\n> changing vistas and the dramatic silences of the sub-Arctic region.\n> Rockwell Kent’s text, embellished by more than fifty pictures from his\n> pen, has the excitement of a quest that attains the nearest paradise\n> man can hope for on earth. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1920, in a volume measuring\napproximately 11½ x 8 in. (280 x 200 mm). ML edition printed from plates\nmade from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the\noriginal introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second\nPreface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. \\[v\\] of the Putnam\nedition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in\nthe volume. Published December 1930. *WR* 27 December 1930. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.\n\nThe Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The\nannouncement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition,\nRockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important\nrevisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations\nthat appear in the six dollar edition” (*PW* 118, 16 August 1930, p.\n574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored\n“two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in\nthe fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently\nwould not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go\nso quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear\nunder the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:\n\n> “Guter Mond, du gehst so stille\n>\n> Durch die Abend Wolken hin.”\n\nThe ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s\nsmaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the\nPutnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by\nabout a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all\nof the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the\ntitle page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam\nbinding.\n\nThe ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to\nAngus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint\nrights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized $1.49 reprint\npublished by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was\nplanning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not\nconsulted about the $1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of\nthe ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2\nJune 1939). Kent bought 240 copies of the discontinued ML edition at\ntwenty-five cents each (Kent to Cerf, 8 June 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMelville, *Moby Dick*, illus.
