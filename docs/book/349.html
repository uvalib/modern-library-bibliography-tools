<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The literary sensation of 1940 was Richard Wright’s novel, <em>Native
Son</em>. Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and profound in its
understanding, this story of crime and punishment belongs to no
season; it has established a permanent place for itself among the
unquestionably important books of our time. Far more than a social
document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by
whites, it is the story of a hunted human being doomed by forces
within and outside himself to be what he is until his very last
breath. (<em>Spring 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A2:</em> As jacket A1 except in medium gray (265), medium yellow

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised with opening sentence replaced by two new sentences
and other changes:</p>
<p>The publication, in 1940, of Richard Wright’s first novel, <em>Native
Son</em>, was hailed with high critical praise and with enthusiasm by
general readers. But this story of crime and punishment belongs to no
season. Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and scrupulous in its
search for understanding of the forces that lead to tragedy, this
novel is far more than a social document that examines the plight of
the Negro in a world dominated by whites. It is the drama of a haunted
human being doomed by the tensions within and outside himself to be
what he is until his very last breath. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harper &amp; Bros., 1940, with an introduction by
Dorothy Canfield Fisher. The Harper plates were available to the ML but
were too large for its format; the ML edition was printed from plates
made from a new typesetting. Published March 1942. <em>WR</em> 14 March 1942.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition shortly after <em>Native Son</em> was
published (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 11 April 1940). Hoyns promised
to talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted
that Grosset &amp; Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright
and for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied
that it should be possible for both Grosset &amp; Dunlap and the ML to do
the book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on
these reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new
titles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit
of everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940).</p>
<p>The following year Cerf wrote to Wright hoping to secure his support for
a ML edition. He indicated that he wanted to publish <em>Native Son</em> in
spring 1942 and invited Wright to write an introduction if a ML edition
could be arranged (Cerf to Wright, 12 August 1941). Wright did not reply
and Cerf wrote again on 3 September 1941. Wright does not appear to have
replied to this letter either. In the end the ML reprinted the Fisher
introduction from the Harper edition.</p>
<p><em>Native Son</em> sold 7,046 copies during the during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>Harper’s informed the ML in 1956 that its College Department wanted to
include <em>Native Son</em> and Richard Hughes’s <em>High Wind in Jamaica</em> (239)
in Harper Modern Classics, a clothbound series aimed at the textbook
market (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper’s, to Klopfer, 20 July 1956).
Harper’s was willing to allow both titles to remain in the ML, but
Klopfer decided to drop them when the stock on hand was exhausted.
“They’re not strong enough titles to hang on in competition with your
own cloth-bound edition” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956).</p>

(*Fall 1954*)\n\nOriginally published by Harper & Bros., 1940, with an introduction by\nDorothy Canfield Fisher. The Harper plates were available to the ML but\nwere too large for its format; the ML edition was printed from plates\nmade from a new typesetting. Published March 1942. *WR* 14 March 1942.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.\n\nCerf expressed interest in a ML edition shortly after *Native Son* was\npublished (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 11 April 1940). Hoyns promised\nto talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted\nthat Grosset & Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright\nand for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied\nthat it should be possible for both Grosset & Dunlap and the ML to do\nthe book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on\nthese reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new\ntitles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit\nof everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940).\n\nThe following year Cerf wrote to Wright hoping to secure his support for\na ML edition.
