<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
How to make available to the contemporary reader all the beauty of
thought, language and imagery of <em>The Divine Comedy</em> has been the
primary consideration of the editors of the Modern Library in issuing
this translated version of Dante’s masterpiece, complete and
unabridged. After careful consideration of all the extant English
translations and after consultation with the foremost university
authorities, the Carlyle-Wicksteed rendering was chosen. It gives the
entire scope, substance and spirit of <em>The Divine Comedy</em> to those
numberless readers who cannot cope with the original. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in vivid red (11) and strong brown (55) on coated
cream paper depicting Dante with an open book standing on a hillside
overlooking the walls of a city, viewed through a border of stone
portals; background within borders in vivid red with title and statement
of responsibility for translation in reverse, other lettering in strong
brown. Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1937; unsigned. Front flap as
jacket A. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
<p>Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by
J. M. Dent &amp; Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December
1932. <em>WR</em> 31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and
subsequently in Vintage Books.</p>
<p>The ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of
reports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from
Henry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the
translation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice
Firuski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the
translation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by
T. S. Eliot and offered Faber &amp; Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on
Dante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent
of Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski,
28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an
introduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to
Grandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.</p>
<p>Cerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few
paragraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932).
Grandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using
and knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the
best translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher
(Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an
inferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the
Temple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph
by the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of
the English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle,
Thomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is
clear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be
readily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its
scholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p.
xiii).</p>
<p>The Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s
<em>Divine Comedy</em> the best translations have been followed: <em>Inferno</em>, by
John Aiken Carlyle; <em>Purgatorio</em>, by Thomas Okey; <em>Paradisio</em>, by Philip
H. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim)
follow, in the main, the excellent notes for the <em>Inferno</em> and the
<em>Purgatorio</em> by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr.
Oeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the <em>Paradisio</em>” (251.1, p. 3;
251.2, p. xvii).</p>
<p>ML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to
the translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the
translator of <em>Purgatorio</em>. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library
(IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations
were not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML
printings until 1963/64 (251.2c).</p>
<p>Shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S.
Singleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of
<em>The Divine Comedy</em> for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working
on a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled
to be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the
seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the
approval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after
theirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances
totaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took
longer than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years
later it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The
Bollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and
1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary.
By that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become
moribund and had ceased adding new titles.</p>
<p><em>The Divine Comedy</em> sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant
titles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.</p>

Wilkins received $50 for the bibliography (Stein to Wilkins, 27 January
1950).</p>
<p>A memo dated 27 September 1950 instructed that the title-page reference
to “Carlyle-Wicksteed Translation” be changed to “Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed
Translation.” The change was made in the MLCE title page only. Thirteen
years later another memo (28 February 1963) indicated that the jacket
and title page of the regular ML edition should read
“Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed Translation.”</p>
<p>The following note was added to verso of the title page: “The material
included in this volume is taken from Temple Classics.”</p>

Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the\ntranslation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice\nFiruski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the\ntranslation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by\nT. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on\nDante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent\nof Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski,\n28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an\nintroduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to\nGrandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.\n\nCerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few\nparagraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932).\nGrandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using\nand knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the\nbest translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher\n(Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an\ninferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the\nTemple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph\nby the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of\nthe English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle,\nThomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is\nclear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be\nreadily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its\nscholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p.\nxiii).\n\nThe Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s\n*Divine Comedy* the best translations have been followed: *Inferno*, by\nJohn Aiken Carlyle; *Purgatorio*, by Thomas Okey; *Paradisio*, by Philip\nH. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim)\nfollow, in the main, the excellent notes for the *Inferno* and the\n*Purgatorio* by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr.\nOeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the *Paradisio*” (251.1, p. 3;\n251.2, p. xvii).\n\nML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to\nthe translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the\ntranslator of *Purgatorio*. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library\n(IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations\nwere not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML\nprintings until 1963/64 (251.2c).\n\nShortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S.\nSingleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of\n*The Divine Comedy* for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working\non a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled\nto be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the\nseven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the\napproval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after\ntheirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances\ntotaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took\nlonger than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years\nlater it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The\nBollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and\n1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary.\nBy that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become\nmoribund and had ceased adding new titles.\n\n*The Divine Comedy* sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant\ntitles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 251.1b.
