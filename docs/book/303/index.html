<p>Front flap:<br>
For three-quarters of a century <em>The Cloister and the Hearth</em> has been
recognized as one of the finest historical novels in existence. It
takes its place in the Modern Library series at a moment when
novelists the world over are occupied with the theme which dominated
all of Charles Reade’s works: the fierce protest against social
injustice. <em>The Cloister and the Hearth</em> assumes even greater
significance today than at any time since it appeared in 1861.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
For more than three-quarters of a century <em>The Cloister and the
Hearth</em> has been acknowledged as one of the finest historical novels
in English literature. It stands comparison with the best of the works
of fiction in its genre and has outlived most of them. Because the
theme which dominated all of Charles Reade’s writings—a fierce protest
against social injustice—is never out of style, <em>The Cloister and the
Hearth</em> has as great a significance today as it has had at any time
since it appeared originally in 1861. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>
