[1–11]<sup>16</sup> [12]<sup>12</sup>. Contents as 353 without
<em>First</em> statement or ML lists. (S<em>pring 1945 jacket</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A1:</em> Non-pictorial in dark blue (183), light bluish gray (190)
and medium gray (265) on coated white paper with lettering in reverse on
inset dark blue panel and three dark blue bands at foot, all surrounded
by white background with floral decorations and short horizontal lines
in medium gray with light bluish gray tinting. Designed by Paul Galdone,
unsigned. Jacket title: THE COLLECTED SHORT STORIES OF DOROTHY PARKER.
<em>Note:</em> The jacket design in different color combinations was also used
in spring 1941 for <em>Five Great Modern Irish Pla</em>ys (339), fall 1941 for
<em>Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner</em> (344), and for four existing
ML anthologies—<em>Best Ghost Stories</em> (67b), <em>Best American Humorous Short
Stories</em> (80f), <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em> (188b), and <em>Great German
Short Novels and Stories</em> (256b) when they appeared in the ML’s larger
format between fall 1939 and the early 1940s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
By almost unanimous consent the wittiest woman of our time, Dorothy
Parker has earned the distinction of having created a wealth of
satirical humor honored by constant quotation and imitation. The
twenty-four stories in this volume represent all her prose work,
including her O. Henry Prize story “Big Blonde,” dialogues such as
“The Sexes,” “New York to Detroit,” and “Here We Are,” monologues as
famous as “Lady with a Lamp” and “Just a Little One,” soliloquies of
the quality of “A Telephone Call” and “The Waltz,” and character
sketches written with devastating irony. (<em>Spring 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A2:</em> As jacket A in deep blue (179) and light gray (264) with
light bluish gray tinting omitted to reduce printing costs. Jacket
title: THE COLLECTED SHORT STORIES OF DOROTHY PARKER. Front flap as
jacket A1 with following sentence added at end: “All her prose is in the
modern manner—bright, knowing and sharp-edged.” (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1939, as <em>Here Lies: The Collected
Stories of Dorothy Parker</em>. ML edition (pp. [v]–viii, [3]–362)
printed from Viking plates with fly title reset to reflect the title of
the ML edition. Published September 1942. <em>WR</em> 12 September 1942. First
printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML paid Viking Press a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents
a copy.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 12,426 copies through October 1943, placing it high
in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles for the 18-month period, May
1942–October 1943. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in
January 1943. Parker’s appeal appears to have weakened after the war.
<em>The Collected Stories of Dorothy Parker</em> was not among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period,
November 1951–October 1952.</p>
