<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
To collect the representative writings of Henry David Thoreau within a
volume of seven hundred and fifty pages has long been the ambition of
the directors of the Modern Library. Now that ambition has been
fulfilled, thanks to the selection made by the editor, Brooks
Atkinson, who also contributes a penetrating critical and biographical
introduction. This volume contains, besides <em>Walden</em>, the essays
<em>Civil Disobedience</em>, <em>Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain
John Brown, Life Without Principle</em> and many of the famous nature
studies. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published September 1937. <em>WR</em> 25 September
1937. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The ML and Houghton Mifflin Co. both published Thoreau collections in
September 1937. When the ML edition was announced, Robert Linscott of
Houghton Mifflin told Klopfer that his firm was “rather daunted” by the
news. Houghton Mifflin had thought that the ML was giving up its
collection and would have abandoned <em>The Works of Thoreau</em>, an 872-page
volume edited by Henry Seidel Canby, if it had known the ML was going
ahead. The Houghton Mifflin collection included selections from
Thoreau’s journals, which were still protected by copyright and had not
been available to the ML. Linscott offered to lease the plates of
Canby’s volume to the ML within eighteen months if the ML gave up its
volume (Linscott to Klopfer, 7 July 1937). Klopfer replied that the ML
had changed its plans as much as it could when the conflict was
discovered and expressed the hope that the two books would not interfere
with each other (Klopfer to Linscott, 8 July 1937).</p>
<p>When the Viking Portable Thoreau appeared in 1949, Brooks Atkinson told
Cerf that it was “such a good job that your Modern Library Thoreau
volume is behind the eight-ball.” He suggested replacing the selections
from <em>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</em> on pp. 301–436 with
the complete work (Atkinson to Cerf, 4 March 1949). Commins replied that
he hoped Atkinson would allow the ML edition to remain unchanged. The
complete text of <em>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</em>, he noted,
would add 200 pages to the collection, at a resetting cost of around
$2,000; changing the page numerals from p. 437 to the end would cost an
additional $200 or $300 (Commins to Atkinson, 1 April 1949). The ML
never acted on Atkinson’s suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Walden and Other Writings</em> sold over 6,000 copies by early 1939 (Cerf
to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). It sold 11,558
copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it
the ninth best-selling title in the regular ML. During the twelve-month
period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,694 copies, making it the
regular ML’s thirty-second best-selling title.</p>

<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Fujita pictorial jacket in deep brown (56), strong red (12)
and black on coated white paper with inset reproduction of B. D.
Maxham’s daguerreotype portrait of Thoreau (1856) in black and deep
brown; lettering in reverse, strong red and deep brown, all against
black background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Henry David Thoreau’s vision of personal freedom—the concept that
moral law and the dictates of the individual conscience are superior
to civil law and governmental statutes—has become part of the American
heritage, particularly pertinent to our own times. Thoreau spent his
life listening to “a different drummer,” and in following his belief
that the individual could lead a life of simplicity and independence
apart from social organization and material civilization, he
anticipated one of the major themes of contemporary America. His
writings communicate his thoughts and offer us his personal vision of
life as well as its tranformation [<em>sic</em>] into a practical working
philosophy on which he based his life style.</p>
<p>This volume contains the full text of <em>Walden</em> as well as the essays
<em>Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John
Brown, Life Without Principle</em>, and many of the famous nature studies.
The editor, Brooks Atkinson, has contributed a penetrating critical
and biographical introduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The offset plates for the text, contents pages, and introduction were
photographically reproduced from a printing of 305a or 305b. Atkinson’s
introduction is repaginated to correspond with 305c but the place and
date of composition (omitted from 305c) is restored. The table of
contents does not reflect the revised front matter of 305c–d: Scudder’s
foreword is not listed at all, and Atkinson’s introduction is shown as
beginning on p. vii.</p>

This volume contains, besides *Walden*, the essays\n> *Civil Disobedience*, *Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain\n> John Brown, Life Without Principle* and many of the famous nature\n> studies. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published September 1937. *WR* 25 September\n1937. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe ML and Houghton Mifflin Co. both published Thoreau collections in\nSeptember 1937. When the ML edition was announced, Robert Linscott of\nHoughton Mifflin told Klopfer that his firm was “rather daunted” by the\nnews. Houghton Mifflin had thought that the ML was giving up its\ncollection and would have abandoned *The Works of Thoreau*, an 872-page\nvolume edited by Henry Seidel Canby, if it had known the ML was going\nahead. The Houghton Mifflin collection included selections from\nThoreau’s journals, which were still protected by copyright and had not\nbeen available to the ML. Linscott offered to lease the plates of\nCanby’s volume to the ML within eighteen months if the ML gave up its\nvolume (Linscott to Klopfer, 7 July 1937). Klopfer replied that the ML\nhad changed its plans as much as it could when the conflict was\ndiscovered and expressed the hope that the two books would not interfere\nwith each other (Klopfer to Linscott, 8 July 1937).\n\nWhen the Viking Portable Thoreau appeared in 1949, Brooks Atkinson told\nCerf that it was “such a good job that your Modern Library Thoreau\nvolume is behind the eight-ball.” He suggested replacing the selections\nfrom *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers* on pp. 301–436 with\nthe complete work (Atkinson to Cerf, 4 March 1949). Commins replied that\nhe hoped Atkinson would allow the ML edition to remain unchanged. The\ncomplete text of *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers*, he noted,\nwould add 200 pages to the collection, at a resetting cost of around\n$2,000; changing the page numerals from p. 437 to the end would cost an\nadditional $200 or $300 (Commins to Atkinson, 1 April 1949). The ML\nnever acted on Atkinson’s suggestion.\n\n*Walden and Other Writings* sold over 6,000 copies by early 1939 (Cerf\nto Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). It sold 11,558\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it\nthe ninth best-selling title in the regular ML. During the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,694 copies, making it the\nregular ML’s thirty-second best-selling title.\n\n#### 305b.

Thoreau spent his\n> life listening to “a different drummer,” and in following his belief\n> that the individual could lead a life of simplicity and independence\n> apart from social organization and material civilization, he\n> anticipated one of the major themes of contemporary America. His\n> writings communicate his thoughts and offer us his personal vision of\n> life as well as its tranformation \\[*sic*\\] into a practical working\n> philosophy on which he based his life style.\n>\n> This volume contains the full text of *Walden* as well as the essays\n> *Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John\n> Brown, Life Without Principle*, and many of the famous nature studies.\n> The editor, Brooks Atkinson, has contributed a penetrating critical\n> and biographical introduction.\n\nThe offset plates for the text, contents pages, and introduction were\nphotographically reproduced from a printing of 305a or 305b. Atkinson’s\nintroduction is repaginated to correspond with 305c but the place and\ndate of composition (omitted from 305c) is restored. The table of\ncontents does not reflect the revised front matter of 305c–d: Scudder’s\nforeword is not listed at all, and Atkinson’s introduction is shown as\nbeginning on p. vii.\n\n#### 305e.
