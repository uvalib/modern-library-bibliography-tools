<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Non-pictorial in deep green (142) and dark grayish yellow
(91) on coated cream paper with lettering in reverse on inset deep green
panel and three deep green bands at foot, all surrounded by cream
background with decorations in dark grayish yellow. Designed by Paul
Galdone; unsigned. <em>Note:</em> The jacket design in different color
combinations was also used in spring 1941 for <em>Five Great Modern Irish
Pla</em>ys (339), fall 1941 for <em>Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner</em>
(344), fall 1942 for <em>Collected Stories of Dorothy Parker</em> (353), and
for four existing ML anthologies – <em>Best Ghost Stories</em> (67b), <em>Best
American Humorous Short Stories</em> (80f), <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em>
(188b), and <em>Great German Short Novels and Stories</em> (256b) when they
appeared in the ML’s larger format between fall 1939 and the early
1940s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
It is almost twenty years since the first of Dorothy Parker’s light
verse, sharpened to arrow-point and dipped in the bubbling acid of her
wit, brought her the kind of fame that belongs to the most frequently
quoted poet of the country. In that time not one of her countless
imitators has so much as disputed her position as the foremost ironist
in America. Here, for the legions of her old and new admirers, are all
the poems which appeared originally in <em>Enough Rope</em>, <em>Sunset Gun</em>,
<em>Death and Taxes</em>, plus numerous additional verses of equal
brilliance. (<em>Fall 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published as <em>Not So Deep as a Well</em> by Viking Press, 1936.
ML edition (pp. [v]–xii, 3–210) printed from Viking plates with part
titles reset. Publication announced for fall 1944. <em>WR</em> 3 February 1945.
First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The title page, part titles, and endpapers of the Viking Press edition
contained decorations by Valenti Angelo printed in moderate reddish
orange. The title page of 375a is adapted from the Viking Press title
page. There was at least one printing of 375a with the <em>First</em> statement
omitted from p. [iv].</p>
<p>The Modern Library paid royalties of 10 cents a copy for Parker’s
<em>Collected Stories</em> (1942) and probably paid the same for <em>Collected
Poetry</em> (1942). By 1971 the royalty rate for <em>Collected Poetry</em> had
risen to 30 cents—still 10 percent of the list price.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dorothy Parker’s verse, sharpened to arrow point and dipped in the
acid of wit, brought her the kind of fame that belongs to the most
frequently quoted poets of their time. Almost every literate person in
America memorized and applied many of her lines to prove a point or
make an impression for wit or wisdom. Her countless imitators only
helped to confirm her deserved and undisputed place as one of
America’s most quick-minded ironists. Here, for the legions of her old
and new admirers, are all the poems which appeared originally in
Enough Rope, Sunset Gun, Death and Taxes, plus numerous additional
verses of equal brilliance. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
