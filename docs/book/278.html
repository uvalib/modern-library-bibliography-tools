<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The merry quips and satirical shafts of the world’s foremost poets are
gathered together in a volume of light-hearted verse. Representative
of the poetry from the earliest days of English verse down to the last
rhymed witticisms of contemporary singers, this anthology is always on
the side of excellence and good taste. The spontaneous gaieties of
Shakespeare and Dorothy Parker, Pope and Ogden Nash, W. S. Gilbert,
Lewis Carroll, Calverley, Edna St. Vincent Millay and scores of others
are captured in a book that mocks at solemnity and banishes the sober
mood. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published January 1935. <em>WR</em> 26 January 1935.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p>Kronenberger outlined his plan for <em>An Anthology of Light Verse</em> in a
letter dated 5 December 1930; the book was published over four years
later. Cerf wrote Kronenberger in 1932 and 1933 asking when the
anthology would be ready. When Kronenberger indicated in November 1933
that he would deliver the manuscript the following week, Cerf replied:
“The Board of Directors of the Modern Library has passed a resolution
unanimously to the effect that the Anthology will be much more welcome
in this dignified sanctum than the compiler thereof. The book had better
be good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933). The anthology sold
5,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of
sales.</p>

When Kronenberger indicated in November 1933\nthat he would deliver the manuscript the following week, Cerf replied:\n“The Board of Directors of the Modern Library has passed a resolution\nunanimously to the effect that the Anthology will be much more welcome\nin this dignified sanctum than the compiler thereof. The book had better\nbe good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933).

Representative\n> of the poetry from the earliest days of English verse down to the last\n> rhymed witticisms of contemporary singers, this anthology is always on\n> the side of excellence and good taste. The spontaneous gaieties of\n> Shakespeare and Dorothy Parker, Pope and Ogden Nash, W. S. Gilbert,\n> Lewis Carroll, Calverley, Edna St. Vincent Millay and scores of others\n> are captured in a book that mocks at solemnity and banishes the sober\n> mood. (*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published January 1935. *WR* 26 January 1935.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1956.\n\nKronenberger outlined his plan for *An Anthology of Light Verse* in a\nletter dated 5 December 1930; the book was published over four years\nlater. Cerf wrote Kronenberger in 1932 and 1933 asking when the\nanthology would be ready. When Kronenberger indicated in November 1933\nthat he would deliver the manuscript the following week, Cerf replied:\n“The Board of Directors of the Modern Library has passed a resolution\nunanimously to the effect that the Anthology will be much more welcome\nin this dignified sanctum than the compiler thereof. The book had better\nbe good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933). The anthology sold\n5,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of\nsales.\n\n"
