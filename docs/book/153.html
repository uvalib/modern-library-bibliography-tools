<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:
The Modern Library offers you herewith a complete and unabridged “Three Musketeers” in one volume to slip into your coat pocket or tuck into an accessible corner of your library shelf. For the next time a fit of boredom or weariness assails you, a dose of d’Artagnan and his three musketeers—Porthos, Athos, and Aramis—is confidently prescribed. (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in vivid red (11) and black on cream paper depicting four swords held aloft with a plumed hat perched on one of the swords; lettering in black, borders in vivid red. Signed: Staloff. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:
However much the industry of Alexandre Dumas is held up as an example of literature in its first manifestations of mass production, <em>The Three Musketeers</em> still throbs with undiminished pulse for the modern reader. Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos [<em>sic</em>] and Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan, there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first and final perfection. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. ML edition printed from Burt plates. Publication announced for February 1928. <em>WR</em> 26 May 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1950 by Le Clercq translation (153.2).</p>
<p>The ML bought a set of plates from Burt. Neither Burt nor the ML knew the name of the translator or the date of the translation (Doris Schneider to E. P. Dutton Co., 4 April 1929).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 18th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Front flap:
This brand-new translation of one of the world’s masterpieces of adventure is alive with the excitement that has held generation after generation of readers spellbound. For those three inseparables, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, with their fourth comrade-in-arms, d’Artagnan, there never can be a dull moment. They are the archetypes of the “cape and sword” heroes whose persistence in fiction is the best possible tribute to Alexandre Dumas, the man who created them in their first and final perfection. (<em>Spring 1950</em>) <em>Note:</em> Copies of the first printing are most often seen in spring 1950 jackets, but it was not unusual for jackets of new ML titles published in January to have lists from the previous season. Copies of this jacket have been reported with the fall 1949 ML list (MLC 47, April 2004, p. 6).</p>

  "full": "\n**ALEXANDRE DUMAS. THE THREE MUSKETEERS. 1928–1970. (ML 143)**  \n\n#### 153.1a. First printing (1928)  \n\n[within double rules] THE | THREE MUSKETEERS | [rule] | BY | ALEXANDRE DUMAS | [rule] | [torchbearer A2] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK  \n\nPp. [*4*], 1–596. [1–18]<sup>16</sup> [19]<sup>12</sup>  \n\n[*1*] half title; [*2*] pub. note D5; [*3*] title; [*4*] *First Modern Library Edition* | 1928; 1–596 text.  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B.  \n\n> Text on front:\nThe Modern Library offers you herewith a complete and unabridged “Three Musketeers” in one volume to slip into your coat pocket or tuck into an accessible corner of your library shelf. For the next time a fit of boredom or weariness assails you, a dose of d’Artagnan and his three musketeers—Porthos, Athos, and Aramis—is confidently prescribed. (*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1929*)  \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in vivid red (11) and black on cream paper depicting four swords held aloft with a plumed hat perched on one of the swords; lettering in black, borders in vivid red. Signed: Staloff. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:\nHowever much the industry of Alexandre Dumas is held up as an example of literature in its first manifestations of mass production, *The Three Musketeers* still throbs with undiminished pulse for the modern reader. Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos [*sic*] and Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan, there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first and final perfection. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nAnonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. ML edition printed from Burt plates. Publication announced for February 1928. *WR* 26 May 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1950 by Le Clercq translation (153.2).  \n\nThe ML bought a set of plates from Burt. Neither Burt nor the ML knew the name of the translator or the date of the translation (Doris Schneider to E. P. Dutton Co., 4 April 1929).  \n\nSales of *The Three Musketeers* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 18th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 153.1b. Title page reset (1941)  \n\n[within triple rules] *The Three* | *Musketeers* | BY | ALEXANDRE DUMAS | [torchbearer E1 at right; 3-line imprint at left] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK  \n\nPp.

(*Spring 1950*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in deep blue (179) and deep yellowish pink (27) on cream paper with line drawing of musketeers and lettering in deep yellowish pink and black on inset cream panel; background in deep blue with pattern of fleurs-de-lis in deep yellowish pink.  \n\n> Front flap:\nThis brand-new translation of one of the world’s masterpieces of adventure is alive with the excitement that has held generation after generation of readers spellbound. For those three inseparables, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, with their fourth comrade-in-arms, d’Artagnan, there never can be a dull moment. They are the archetypes of the “cape and sword” heroes whose persistence in fiction is the best possible tribute to Alexandre Dumas, the man who created them in their first and final perfection. (*Spring 1950*) *Note:* Copies of the first printing are most often seen in spring 1950 jackets, but it was not unusual for jackets of new ML titles published in January to have lists from the previous season. Copies of this jacket have been reported with the fall 1949 ML list (MLC 47, April 2004, p. 6).  \n\nLe Clercq translation commissioned by ML. Published spring 1950. *WR* 18 February 1950.
