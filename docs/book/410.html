<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought to
include in the series a comprehensive volume of Emily Dickinson’s
poetry. Now, through the co-operation of her original publishers, we
are able to offer the passionate and mystical verses of one of the
most original and appealing poets in the entire history of American
letters. The romantic circumstances under which Emily Dickinson became
a hermit and guarded her poems against publication during her lifetime
are now a legend; her poems themselves are the real and lasting
expression of her incomparable intensity and delicacy. (<em>Fall 1948</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published fall 1948. <em>WR</em> 23 October 1948. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in a ML edition of Dickinson’s poetry in
1937, offering Little, Brown a $1,500 advance against royalties. At that
time all of Dickinson’s poems were protected by copyright, and Little,
Brown rejected the offer. Alfred R. McIntyre, the firm’s president,
wrote: “You have made a good offer, but it does not change our views.
This is a very valuable property and we are afraid that, though our
sales might not fall off tremendously, they would fall off enough so
that we should not gain by the transaction.” He noted that Little,
Brown’s share of the advance would be $750 (the other half would go to
the Dickinson estate) and that if it took five years for sales of the ML
edition to cover the advance, Little, Brown’s income would only be $150
a year—and that a very small decline in sales would erase the firm’s
profit (McIntyre to Cerf, 26 May 1937).</p>
<p>By 1948, when the ML was able to negotiate reprint rights, Little,
Brown’s situation had changed but the ML was still unable to get
everything it wanted. <em>Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson</em>, published in
the ML in October 1948, consisted of Dickinson’s <em>Poems</em> (1890), <em>Poems:
Second Series</em> (1891), and a selection from <em>Poems: Third Series</em>
(1896). The three books, originally published by Roberts Brothers, had
been published by Little, Brown &amp; Co. since 1898, when it absorbed
Roberts Brothers.</p>
<p>The first two volumes entered the public domain in 1946 and 1947, and
the third would enter the public domain in 1952. The ML had hoped to
base its edition on Dickinson’s <em>Poems: Centenary Edition</em> (Little,
Brown, 1930), which included poems from two subsequent volumes. Little,
Brown flatly refused to allow the ML to base its selection on the
Centenary Edition. The ML wanted a more comprehensive collection than
the poems already in the public domain since World Publishing Co. was
bringing out a volume of Dickinson’s public domain poems in their Living
Library series. Little, Brown finally gave the ML permission to include
poems from the first three volumes provided not more than a third of the
total came from <em>Poems: Third Series</em> (Linscott to Conrad Aiken, 31
March 1948 and 5 April 1948). This stipulation required the omission of
twenty-one poems from <em>Poems: Third Series</em>.</p>
<p>Aiken had repeatedly urged the ML to reprint his <em>Selected Poems of
Emily Dickinson</em> (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924). When the arrangements
with Little, Brown were made Linscott wrote him, “Since this looks like
a very simple editorial job, Bennett has suggested that I make the
selection. It seemed to me that we might be able to use the Introduction
you did for the English edition (or perhaps a revised version) on
payment of a comparatively small fee. The reason for this parsimony is
that we have to pay a heavy royalty to Little Brown which leaves us
little or no editorial margin” (Linscott to Aiken, 31 March 1948).</p>
<p>Aiken, who had clashed with the ML three years earlier over the removal
of poems by Ezra Pound from <em>An Anthology of Famous English and American
Poetry</em> (G68), which he edited with William Rose Benét, responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What’s this, another Trojan Horse? another case of “dona ferentes”,
as when Saxe [Commins] told me of the marvelously easy way I could
make $250 without a stroke of work, all by just letting him use my
comprehensive anthology with Bill Benet’s book to make a Giant—and
little aiken [<em>sic</em>] to get no royalty, while the Giant proceeded to
blanket the sales of the Modern Library edition???? As I’ve written
Bernice [Baumgarten, Aiken’s agent], for fifteen years or longer
I’ve repeatedly been urging the use of my Selected ED in the Modern
Library, and this little manoeouvre [<em>sic</em>] doesn’t, from where I’m
sitting, look either pretty or generous—nor <u>very</u> much like the
magnanimity one expects from an old friend (Aiken to Linscott, 2 April
1948; underlining in original).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott replied that little editing was involved since the ML wanted to
use as many poems as possible and only a handful of poems had be omitted
from the third volume (Linscott to Aiken, 5 April 1948).</p>
<p>There were significant differences between the ML volume and Aiken’s
1924 anthology. The ML edition presents 426 of Dickinson’s poems in four
sequences (“Life,” “Nature,” “Love,” and “Time and Eternity”). Aiken’s
anthology included 220 poems with each poem printed on a separate page.
The ML numbered the poems within each sequence. Aiken had given them
titles.</p>
<p>The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 6 cents a copy. Aiken was
pacified with a payment of $1,000 for the use of his introduction to
<em>Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson</em> (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924), which
he revised for the ML. The revisions included correcting his reference
in the first paragraph to T. W. Higginson as “editor of the <em>Atlantic
Monthly</em> at that time” (Cape edition, pp. 5–6) to “essayist and
contributor to the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>” (ML edition, p. vii–viii).</p>
<p>Sales through spring 1958 totaled 36,631 copies; annual sales for the
three-year period May 1955–April 1958 showed steady growth as follows:
4,066 (1955–56), 5,141 (1956–57), and 5,246 (1957–58). Bonnell and
Bonnell (p. 112) report a seventeenth printing of 7,000 copies in 1963
and seven printings “since then” totaling 25,500 copies.</p>
<p><em>Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson</em> has remained one of the most readily
available editions of Dickinson’s poetry for most of the period since
its publication. It survived the 1970s, when Random House slashed
hundreds of titles from the Modern Library, and remained in print into
the 1980s. The contents, based on the copyright status of Dickinson’s
poems in 1948, remained unchanged throughout this period. It was only in
1996, after Random House revived the Modern Library, that the twenty-one
poems omitted from the original edition were added. By this time they
had been in the public domain for forty-four years. The only other
differences between the content of the original ML edition and the reset
1996 version were the replacement of Aiken’s introduction with an
unsigned biographical note by Billy Collins and the welcome addition of
an index of first lines.</p>

Now, through the co-operation of her original publishers, we\n> are able to offer the passionate and mystical verses of one of the\n> most original and appealing poets in the entire history of American\n> letters. The romantic circumstances under which Emily Dickinson became\n> a hermit and guarded her poems against publication during her lifetime\n> are now a legend; her poems themselves are the real and lasting\n> expression of her incomparable intensity and delicacy. (*Fall 1948*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1948. *WR* 23 October 1948. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a ML edition of Dickinson’s poetry in\n1937, offering Little, Brown a $1,500 advance against royalties. At that\ntime all of Dickinson’s poems were protected by copyright, and Little,\nBrown rejected the offer. Alfred R. McIntyre, the firm’s president,\nwrote: “You have made a good offer, but it does not change our views.\nThis is a very valuable property and we are afraid that, though our\nsales might not fall off tremendously, they would fall off enough so\nthat we should not gain by the transaction.” He noted that Little,\nBrown’s share of the advance would be $750 (the other half would go to\nthe Dickinson estate) and that if it took five years for sales of the ML\nedition to cover the advance, Little, Brown’s income would only be $150\na year—and that a very small decline in sales would erase the firm’s\nprofit (McIntyre to Cerf, 26 May 1937).\n\nBy 1948, when the ML was able to negotiate reprint rights, Little,\nBrown’s situation had changed but the ML was still unable to get\neverything it wanted. *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson*, published in\nthe ML in October 1948, consisted of Dickinson’s *Poems* (1890), *Poems:\nSecond Series* (1891), and a selection from *Poems: Third Series*\n(1896). The three books, originally published by Roberts Brothers, had\nbeen published by Little, Brown & Co. since 1898, when it absorbed\nRoberts Brothers.\n\nThe first two volumes entered the public domain in 1946 and 1947, and\nthe third would enter the public domain in 1952. The ML had hoped to\nbase its edition on Dickinson’s *Poems: Centenary Edition* (Little,\nBrown, 1930), which included poems from two subsequent volumes. Little,\nBrown flatly refused to allow the ML to base its selection on the\nCentenary Edition. The ML wanted a more comprehensive collection than\nthe poems already in the public domain since World Publishing Co. was\nbringing out a volume of Dickinson’s public domain poems in their Living\nLibrary series. Little, Brown finally gave the ML permission to include\npoems from the first three volumes provided not more than a third of the\ntotal came from *Poems: Third Series* (Linscott to Conrad Aiken, 31\nMarch 1948 and 5 April 1948). This stipulation required the omission of\ntwenty-one poems from *Poems: Third Series*.\n\nAiken had repeatedly urged the ML to reprint his *Selected Poems of\nEmily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924). When the arrangements\nwith Little, Brown were made Linscott wrote him, “Since this looks like\na very simple editorial job, Bennett has suggested that I make the\nselection. It seemed to me that we might be able to use the Introduction\nyou did for the English edition (or perhaps a revised version) on\npayment of a comparatively small fee. The reason for this parsimony is\nthat we have to pay a heavy royalty to Little Brown which leaves us\nlittle or no editorial margin” (Linscott to Aiken, 31 March 1948).\n\nAiken, who had clashed with the ML three years earlier over the removal\nof poems by Ezra Pound from *An Anthology of Famous English and American\nPoetry* (G68), which he edited with William Rose Benét, responded:\n\n> “What’s this, another Trojan Horse? another case of “dona ferentes”,\n> as when Saxe \\[Commins\\] told me of the marvelously easy way I could\n> make $250 without a stroke of work, all by just letting him use my\n> comprehensive anthology with Bill Benet’s book to make a Giant—and\n> little aiken \\[*sic*\\] to get no royalty, while the Giant proceeded to\n> blanket the sales of the Modern Library edition???? As I’ve written\n> Bernice \\[Baumgarten, Aiken’s agent\\], for fifteen years or longer\n> I’ve repeatedly been urging the use of my Selected ED in the Modern\n> Library, and this little manoeouvre \\[*sic*\\] doesn’t, from where I’m\n> sitting, look either pretty or generous—nor <u>very</u> much like the\n> magnanimity one expects from an old friend (Aiken to Linscott, 2 April\n> 1948; underlining in original).\n\nLinscott replied that little editing was involved since the ML wanted to\nuse as many poems as possible and only a handful of poems had be omitted\nfrom the third volume (Linscott to Aiken, 5 April 1948).\n\nThere were significant differences between the ML volume and Aiken’s\n1924 anthology. The ML edition presents 426 of Dickinson’s poems in four\nsequences (“Life,” “Nature,” “Love,” and “Time and Eternity”). Aiken’s\nanthology included 220 poems with each poem printed on a separate page.\nThe ML numbered the poems within each sequence. Aiken had given them\ntitles.\n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 6 cents a copy. Aiken was\npacified with a payment of $1,000 for the use of his introduction to\n*Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924), which\nhe revised for the ML. The revisions included correcting his reference\nin the first paragraph to T. W. Higginson as “editor of the *Atlantic\nMonthly* at that time” (Cape edition, pp. 5–6) to “essayist and\ncontributor to the *Atlantic Monthly*” (ML edition, p. vii–viii).\n\nSales through spring 1958 totaled 36,631 copies; annual sales for the\nthree-year period May 1955–April 1958 showed steady growth as follows:\n4,066 (1955–56), 5,141 (1956–57), and 5,246 (1957–58). Bonnell and\nBonnell (p. 112) report a seventeenth printing of 7,000 copies in 1963\nand seven printings “since then” totaling 25,500 copies.\n\n*Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* has remained one of the most readily\navailable editions of Dickinson’s poetry for most of the period since\nits publication. It survived the 1970s, when Random House slashed\nhundreds of titles from the Modern Library, and remained in print into\nthe 1980s. The contents, based on the copyright status of Dickinson’s\npoems in 1948, remained unchanged throughout this period. It was only in\n1996, after Random House revived the Modern Library, that the twenty-one\npoems omitted from the original edition were added. By this time they\nhad been in the public domain for forty-four years. The only other\ndifferences between the content of the original ML edition and the reset\n1996 version were the replacement of Aiken’s introduction with an\nunsigned biographical note by Billy Collins and the welcome addition of\nan index of first lines.",
