<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought to include in the series a comprehensive volume of Emily Dickinson’s poetry. Now, through the co-operation of her original publishers, we are able to offer the passionate and mystical verses of one of the most original and appealing poets in the entire history of American letters. The romantic circumstances under which Emily Dickinson became a hermit and guarded her poems against publication during her lifetime are now a legend; her poems themselves are the real and lasting expression of her incomparable intensity and delicacy. (<em>Fall 1948</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published fall 1948. <em>WR</em> 23 October 1948. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in a ML edition of Dickinson’s poetry in 1937, offering Little, Brown a $1,500 advance against royalties. At that time all of Dickinson’s poems were protected by copyright, and Little, Brown rejected the offer. Alfred R. McIntyre, the firm’s president, wrote: “You have made a good offer, but it does not change our views. This is a very valuable property and we are afraid that, though our sales might not fall off tremendously, they would fall off enough so that we should not gain by the transaction.” He noted that Little, Brown’s share of the advance would be $750 (the other half would go to the Dickinson estate) and that if it took five years for sales of the ML edition to cover the advance, Little, Brown’s income would only be $150 a year—and that a very small decline in sales would erase the firm’s profit (McIntyre to Cerf, 26 May 1937).</p>
<p>By 1948, when the ML was able to negotiate reprint rights, Little, Brown’s situation had changed but the ML was still unable to get everything it wanted. <em>Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson</em>, published in the ML in October 1948, consisted of Dickinson’s <em>Poems</em> (1890), <em>Poems: Second Series</em> (1891), and a selection from <em>Poems: Third Series</em> (1896). The three books, originally published by Roberts Brothers, had been published by Little, Brown &amp; Co. since 1898, when it absorbed Roberts Brothers.</p>
<p>The first two volumes entered the public domain in 1946 and 1947, and the third would enter the public domain in 1952. The ML had hoped to base its edition on Dickinson’s <em>Poems: Centenary Edition</em> (Little, Brown, 1930), which included poems from two subsequent volumes. Little, Brown flatly refused to allow the ML to base its selection on the Centenary Edition. The ML wanted a more comprehensive collection than the poems already in the public domain since World Publishing Co. was bringing out a volume of Dickinson’s public domain poems in their Living Library series. Little, Brown finally gave the ML permission to include poems from the first three volumes provided not more than a third of the total came from <em>Poems: Third Series</em> (Linscott to Conrad Aiken, 31 March 1948 and 5 April 1948). This stipulation required the omission of twenty-one poems from <em>Poems: Third Series</em>.</p>
<p>Aiken had repeatedly urged the ML to reprint his <em>Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson</em> (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924). When the arrangements with Little, Brown were made Linscott wrote him, “Since this looks like a very simple editorial job, Bennett has suggested that I make the selection. It seemed to me that we might be able to use the Introduction you did for the English edition (or perhaps a revised version) on payment of a comparatively small fee. The reason for this parsimony is that we have to pay a heavy royalty to Little Brown which leaves us little or no editorial margin” (Linscott to Aiken, 31 March 1948).</p>
<p>Aiken, who had clashed with the ML three years earlier over the removal of poems by Ezra Pound from <em>An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry</em> (G68), which he edited with William Rose Benét, responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What’s this, another Trojan Horse? another case of “dona ferentes”, as when Saxe [Commins] told me of the marvelously easy way I could make $250 without a stroke of work, all by just letting him use my comprehensive anthology with Bill Benet’s book to make a Giant—and little aiken [<em>sic</em>] to get no royalty, while the Giant proceeded to blanket the sales of the Modern Library edition???? As I’ve written Bernice [Baumgarten, Aiken’s agent], for fifteen years or longer I’ve repeatedly been urging the use of my Selected ED in the Modern Library, and this little manoeouvre [<em>sic</em>] doesn’t, from where I’m sitting, look either pretty or generous—nor <u>very</u> much like the magnanimity one expects from an old friend (Aiken to Linscott, 2 April 1948; underlining in original).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott replied that little editing was involved since the ML wanted to use as many poems as possible and only a handful of poems had be omitted from the third volume (Linscott to Aiken, 5 April 1948).</p>
<p>There were significant differences between the ML volume and Aiken’s 1924 anthology. The ML edition presents 426 of Dickinson’s poems in four sequences (“Life,” “Nature,” “Love,” and “Time and Eternity”). Aiken’s anthology included 220 poems with each poem printed on a separate page. The ML numbered the poems within each sequence. Aiken had given them titles.</p>
<p>The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 6 cents a copy. Aiken was pacified with a payment of $1,000 for the use of his introduction to <em>Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson</em> (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924), which he revised for the ML. The revisions included correcting his reference in the first paragraph to T. W. Higginson as “editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> at that time” (Cape edition, pp. 5–6) to “essayist and contributor to the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>” (ML edition, p. vii–viii).</p>
<p>Sales through spring 1958 totaled 36,631 copies; annual sales for the three-year period May 1955–April 1958 showed steady growth as follows: 4,066 (1955–56), 5,141 (1956–57), and 5,246 (1957–58). Bonnell and Bonnell (p. 112) report a seventeenth printing of 7,000 copies in 1963 and seven printings “since then” totaling 25,500 copies.</p>
<p><em>Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson</em> has remained one of the most readily available editions of Dickinson’s poetry for most of the period since its publication. It survived the 1970s, when Random House slashed hundreds of titles from the Modern Library, and remained in print into the 1980s. The contents, based on the copyright status of Dickinson’s poems in 1948, remained unchanged throughout this period. It was only in 1996, after Random House revived the Modern Library, that the twenty-one poems omitted from the original edition were added. By this time they had been in the public domain for forty-four years. The only other differences between the content of the original ML edition and the reset 1996 version were the replacement of Aiken’s introduction with an unsigned biographical note by Billy Collins and the welcome addition of an index of first lines.</p>

Now, through the co-operation of her original publishers, we are able to offer the passionate and mystical verses of one of the most original and appealing poets in the entire history of American letters. The romantic circumstances under which Emily Dickinson became a hermit and guarded her poems against publication during her lifetime are now a legend; her poems themselves are the real and lasting expression of her incomparable intensity and delicacy. (*Fall 1948*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1948. *WR* 23 October 1948. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nCerf first expressed interest in a ML edition of Dickinson’s poetry in 1937, offering Little, Brown a \\$1,500 advance against royalties. At that time all of Dickinson’s poems were protected by copyright, and Little, Brown rejected the offer. Alfred R. McIntyre, the firm’s president, wrote: “You have made a good offer, but it does not change our views. This is a very valuable property and we are afraid that, though our sales might not fall off tremendously, they would fall off enough so that we should not gain by the transaction.” He noted that Little, Brown’s share of the advance would be \\$750 (the other half would go to the Dickinson estate) and that if it took five years for sales of the ML edition to cover the advance, Little, Brown’s income would only be \\$150 a year—and that a very small decline in sales would erase the firm’s profit (McIntyre to Cerf, 26 May 1937). \n\nBy 1948, when the ML was able to negotiate reprint rights, Little, Brown’s situation had changed but the ML was still unable to get everything it wanted. *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson*, published in the ML in October 1948, consisted of Dickinson’s *Poems* (1890), *Poems: Second Series* (1891), and a selection from *Poems: Third Series* (1896). The three books, originally published by Roberts Brothers, had been published by Little, Brown & Co. since 1898, when it absorbed Roberts Brothers. \n\nThe first two volumes entered the public domain in 1946 and 1947, and the third would enter the public domain in 1952. The ML had hoped to base its edition on Dickinson’s *Poems: Centenary Edition* (Little, Brown, 1930), which included poems from two subsequent volumes. Little, Brown flatly refused to allow the ML to base its selection on the Centenary Edition. The ML wanted a more comprehensive collection than the poems already in the public domain since World Publishing Co. was bringing out a volume of Dickinson’s public domain poems in their Living Library series. Little, Brown finally gave the ML permission to include poems from the first three volumes provided not more than a third of the total came from *Poems: Third Series* (Linscott to Conrad Aiken, 31 March 1948 and 5 April 1948). This stipulation required the omission of twenty-one poems from *Poems: Third Series*. \n\nAiken had repeatedly urged the ML to reprint his *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924). When the arrangements with Little, Brown were made Linscott wrote him, “Since this looks like a very simple editorial job, Bennett has suggested that I make the selection. It seemed to me that we might be able to use the Introduction you did for the English edition (or perhaps a revised version) on payment of a comparatively small fee. The reason for this parsimony is that we have to pay a heavy royalty to Little Brown which leaves us little or no editorial margin” (Linscott to Aiken, 31 March 1948). \n\nAiken, who had clashed with the ML three years earlier over the removal of poems by Ezra Pound from *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68), which he edited with William Rose Benét, responded: \n\n> “What’s this, another Trojan Horse? another case of “dona ferentes”, as when Saxe [Commins] told me of the marvelously easy way I could make \\$250 without a stroke of work, all by just letting him use my comprehensive anthology with Bill Benet’s book to make a Giant—and little aiken [*sic*] to get no royalty, while the Giant proceeded to blanket the sales of the Modern Library edition???? As I’ve written Bernice [Baumgarten, Aiken’s agent], for fifteen years or longer I’ve repeatedly been urging the use of my Selected ED in the Modern Library, and this little manoeouvre [*sic*] doesn’t, from where I’m sitting, look either pretty or generous—nor <u>very</u> much like the magnanimity one expects from an old friend (Aiken to Linscott, 2 April 1948; underlining in original). \n\nLinscott replied that little editing was involved since the ML wanted to use as many poems as possible and only a handful of poems had be omitted from the third volume (Linscott to Aiken, 5 April 1948). \n\nThere were significant differences between the ML volume and Aiken’s 1924 anthology. The ML edition presents 426 of Dickinson’s poems in four sequences (“Life,” “Nature,” “Love,” and “Time and Eternity”). Aiken’s anthology included 220 poems with each poem printed on a separate page. The ML numbered the poems within each sequence. Aiken had given them titles. \n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 6 cents a copy. Aiken was pacified with a payment of \\$1,000 for the use of his introduction to *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924), which he revised for the ML. The revisions included correcting his reference in the first paragraph to T. W. Higginson as “editor of the *Atlantic Monthly* at that time” (Cape edition, pp. 5–6) to “essayist and contributor to the *Atlantic Monthly*” (ML edition, p. vii–viii). \n\nSales through spring 1958 totaled 36,631 copies; annual sales for the three-year period May 1955–April 1958 showed steady growth as follows: 4,066 (1955–56), 5,141 (1956–57), and 5,246 (1957–58). Bonnell and Bonnell (p. 112) report a seventeenth printing of 7,000 copies in 1963 and seven printings “since then” totaling 25,500 copies. \n\n*Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* has remained one of the most readily available editions of Dickinson’s poetry for most of the period since its publication. It survived the 1970s, when Random House slashed hundreds of titles from the Modern Library, and remained in print into the 1980s. The contents, based on the copyright status of Dickinson’s poems in 1948, remained unchanged throughout this period. It was only in 1996, after Random House revived the Modern Library, that the twenty-one poems omitted from the original edition were added. By this time they had been in the public domain for forty-four years. The only other differences between the content of the original ML edition and the reset 1996 version were the replacement of Aiken’s introduction with an unsigned biographical note by Billy Collins and the welcome addition of an index of first lines. \n\n",
