<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Generation after generation of Americans has been brought up on the
poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. To him can be attributed a major
share of what love for poetry great masses of our people cherish. Such
poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles
Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our
heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for
our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great
lyricists of our national literature. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published April 1932. <em>WR</em> 7 May 1932. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Longfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his
time. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when
Longfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes
substantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at
Harvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death
he received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice
what he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained
sufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin
Co., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher,
Ticknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced
its edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott
at Houghton Mifflin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we
first noticed your announcement . . . [Longfellow is the] Poet of
Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled
at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and
office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for
which the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy
acknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).</p>
<p>The ML initially intended to base its edition on <em>The Poems of Henry W.
Longfellow</em>, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library
series. Linscott wrote again four days later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow”
which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright
before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents
as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and
a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19
January 1932).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete
Cambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.</p>
<p>At this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton
Mifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant
figure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537),
intervened. He wrote Cerf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it [the
Longfellow matter]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow
material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that
poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and
have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal
relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have
tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.</p>
<p>Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library
cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, <em>et cetera</em>, or can
you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I
believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February
1932)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of
Longfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to
Linscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932).
Linscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may
have gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the
circumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at
present” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).</p>
<p>In the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the
copyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include
nearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.</p>
<p>When the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who
acknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best
wishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML
edition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a
new typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that
had entered the public domain since 1932.</p>
<p><em>The Poems of Longfellow</em> and <em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em>
(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic
jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets
by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and
Franklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by
a pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for <em>The Poems of
Longfellow</em> remained in use until the early 1940s.</p>
<p>Cerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s,
but it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. <em>The Poems
of Longfellow</em> sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant
titles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed
services. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on
to its first-quarter ranking.</p>

(*Spring 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Generation after generation of Americans has been brought up on the\n> poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. To him can be attributed a major\n> share of what love for poetry great masses of our people cherish. Such\n> poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles\n> Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our\n> heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for\n> our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great\n> lyricists of our national literature. (*Spring 1938*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nLongfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his\ntime. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when\nLongfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes\nsubstantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at\nHarvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death\nhe received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice\nwhat he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained\nsufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin\nCo., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher,\nTicknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced\nits edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott\nat Houghton Mifflin:\n\n> A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we\n> first noticed your announcement . . . \\[Longfellow is the\\] Poet of\n> Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled\n> at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and\n> office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”\n\nLinscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for\nwhich the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy\nacknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).\n\nThe ML initially intended to base its edition on *The Poems of Henry W.\nLongfellow*, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library\nseries. Linscott wrote again four days later:\n\n> You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow”\n> which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright\n> before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents\n> as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and\n> a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19\n> January 1932).\n\nLinscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete\nCambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.\n\nAt this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton\nMifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant\nfigure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537),\nintervened. He wrote Cerf:\n\n> I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it \\[the\n> Longfellow matter\\]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow\n> material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that\n> poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and\n> have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal\n> relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have\n> tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.\n>\n> Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library\n> cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, *et cetera*, or can\n> you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I\n> believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February\n> 1932)\n\nBoth Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of\nLongfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to\nLinscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932).\nLinscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may\nhave gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the\ncircumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at\npresent” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).\n\nIn the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the\ncopyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include\nnearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.\n\nWhen the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who\nacknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best\nwishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML\nedition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a\nnew typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that\nhad entered the public domain since 1932.\n\n*The Poems of Longfellow* and *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*\n(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic\njacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets\nby 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and\nFranklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by\na pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for *The Poems of\nLongfellow* remained in use until the early 1940s.\n\nCerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s,\nbut it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. *The Poems\nof Longfellow* sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed\nservices. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on\nto its first-quarter ranking.\n\n#### 235.1b.
