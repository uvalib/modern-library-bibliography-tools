<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few books in the annals of American literature have exercised so
far-reaching an influence in awakening interest in the social order as
has Edward Bellamy’s utopian novel, <em>Looking Backward</em>. In its own
field it is a classic in the tradition of Plato’s <em>Republic</em>, Thomas
More’s <em>Utopia</em> and William Morris’s <em>News from Nowhere</em>. Today, while
a new world is in the making and everyone is venturing guesses as to
its reorganization, this novel is a visionary’s guide to our own
future. Its inclusion in the Modern Library series gives new emphasis
to the perennial timeliness of Bellamy’s masterpiece. (<em>Spring 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Ticknor &amp; Co., 1888. New edition with revisions
in the text and the addition of the author’s postscript published by
Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1889, to which the Broun introduction was later
added. New bibliographical edition without the Broun introduction
published by Houghton, Mifflin, 1941. ML edition (pp. [v]–vi,
[1]–276) printed from plates previously used for the 1941 Houghton,
Mifflin edition with Broun introduction restored. Publication announced
for November 1942. <em>WR</em> 31 October 1942. First printing: Not
established. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML edition was published shortly before <em>Looking Backward</em> entered
the public domain. By reprinting <em>Looking Backward</em> with the permission
of Houghton Mifflin and paying royalties of 10 cents a copy, the ML was
able to establish its edition in the marketplace before other potential
reprinters.</p>
<p><em>Looking Backward</em> sold 10,019 copies by 1 November 1943, placing it
high in the first quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period,
November 1951–October 1952.</p>

McKnight Kauffer\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Few books in the annals of American literature have exercised so\n> far-reaching an influence in awakening interest in the social order as\n> has Edward Bellamy’s utopian novel, *Looking Backward*. In its own\n> field it is a classic in the tradition of Plato’s *Republic*, Thomas\n> More’s *Utopia* and William Morris’s *News from Nowhere*. Today, while\n> a new world is in the making and everyone is venturing guesses as to\n> its reorganization, this novel is a visionary’s guide to our own\n> future. Its inclusion in the Modern Library series gives new emphasis\n> to the perennial timeliness of Bellamy’s masterpiece. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by Ticknor & Co., 1888. New edition with revisions\nin the text and the addition of the author’s postscript published by\nHoughton, Mifflin Co., 1889, to which the Broun introduction was later\nadded. New bibliographical edition without the Broun introduction\npublished by Houghton, Mifflin, 1941. ML edition (pp. \\[v\\]–vi,\n\\[1\\]–276) printed from plates previously used for the 1941 Houghton,\nMifflin edition with Broun introduction restored. Publication announced\nfor November 1942. *WR* 31 October 1942. First printing: Not\nestablished. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML edition was published shortly before *Looking Backward* entered\nthe public domain. By reprinting *Looking Backward* with the permission\nof Houghton Mifflin and paying royalties of 10 cents a copy, the ML was\nable to establish its edition in the marketplace before other potential\nreprinters.\n\n*Looking Backward* sold 10,019 copies by 1 November 1943, placing it\nhigh in the first quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 357b.

In its own\n> field it is a classic in the tradition of Plato’s *Republic*, Thomas\n> More’s *Utopia* and William Morris’s *News from Nowhere*. Today, while\n> a new world is in the making and everyone is venturing guesses as to\n> its reorganization, this novel is a visionary’s guide to our own\n> future. Its inclusion in the Modern Library series gives new emphasis\n> to the perennial timeliness of Bellamy’s masterpiece. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by Ticknor & Co., 1888.
