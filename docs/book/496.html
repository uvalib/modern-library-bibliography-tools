<p><strong>JAMES THURBER. THE THURBER CARNIVAL. 1957– . (ML 85)</strong></p>
<h4><a href='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/revision/496a.html'>496a. First printing (1957) </a></h4>
<p>THE | THURBER | CARNIVAL | <em>written and illustrated by</em> | JAMES | THURBER | [drawing of people and animals in flight] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK</p>
<p>Pp. [<em>12</em>], [1–2] 3–369 [370–372]. [1–12]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[<em>1</em>] half title; [<em>2</em>] blank; [<em>3</em>] title; [<em>4</em>] First Modern Library Edition, 1957 | Copyright, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, | 1942, 1943, 1945, by James Thurber. . . . ; [<em>5</em>–<em>8</em>] CONTENTS; [<em>9</em>–<em>11</em>] PREFACE | [rule] | My Sixty Years | with James Thurber signed p. [<em>11</em>]: J<span class="smallcaps">ames Thurber</span> | <em>September 1, 1957</em>; [<em>12</em>] blank; [1] fly title with drawing of dog; [2] blank; 3–369 text and drawings; [370–372] blank. <em>Note: First</em> statement retained on all printings examined.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in black, vivid red (11), brilliant yellow (83), strong orange (50) and light grayish yellowish brown (79) on coated white paper with Thurber drawing of couple viewed through a keyhole; title lettering in vivid red, brilliant yellow, strong orange and light grayish yellowish brown, other lettering in reverse and brilliant yellow, all against black background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Anyone who tries to define the unique genius of James Thurber is bound to end up in contradictory phrases. Even the rarely-at-a-loss-for-words <em>London Times</em> concluded a long discussion of his humor in helpless frustration, saying, “Thurber is Thurber.”
Perhaps it is best for us to state simply that this is a collection of some of his best writings and drawings. We believe every reader will share our opinion that Thurber is - - - well, is Thurber. (<em>Fall 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harper &amp; Bros., 1945. ML edition (pp. [1]–369) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Harper edition with Thurber’s dedication and foreword omitted, table of contents partially reset, and the preface on pp. 9–11 updated, re-titled (from “My Fifty Years with James Thurber”) and reset. The drawing on the title page is shifted from the half title of the Harper edition. Published November 1957. <em>WR</em> 2 December 1957. First printing: 15,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf had been trying to get <em>The Thurber Carnival</em> since 1946, when he offered a $6,000 advance to include it in the Giants (Cerf to William Rose, Jr., Harper &amp; Bros., 24 January 1946). Harper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit <em>Reading for Pleasure</em>, an anthology published by Harper &amp; Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted” (Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10 percent of the retail price. <em>Brave New World</em> (485) was published in the ML in fall 1956.</p>
<p>Bowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D of the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month Club using duplicate plates supplied by Harper &amp; Bros. In his list of variations that distinguish state D (p. 55), however, the nose of the dog on the fly title (p. [1]) is indicated as absent. The dog’s nose is present in all ML printings examined.</p>
<p>Thurber’s original preface was titled “My Fifty Years with James Thurber” and dated “December 6, 1944.” The re-titled preface in the ML edition, “My Sixty Years with James Thurber,” is identical to the original version except for changes in the first and next-to-last paragraphs.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial on kraft paper with lettering in very deep purple (220) and torchbearer in deep brown (56).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> As James Thurber writes in his introduction, “This book contains a selection of the stories and drawings the old boy did in his prime, a period which extended roughly from the year Lindbergh flew the Atlantic to the day coffee was rationed. He presents this to his readers with his sincere best wishes for a happy new world.”
This anthology draws from such Thurber classics as <em>My World and Welcome to It</em>, <em>Let Your Mind Alone</em>, <em>The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze</em>, <em>My Life and Hard Times</em>, <em>Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated</em>, <em>The Owl in the Attic</em>, <em>The Seal in the Bedroom</em>, and <em>Men, Women and Dogs</em>.</p>

Even the rarely-at-a-loss-for-words *London Times* concluded a long discussion of his humor in helpless frustration, saying, “Thurber is Thurber.” \n> Perhaps it is best for us to state simply that this is a collection of some of his best writings and drawings. We believe every reader will share our opinion that Thurber is - - - well, is Thurber. (*Fall 1957*) \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Bros., 1945. ML edition (pp. [1]–369) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Harper edition with Thurber’s dedication and foreword omitted, table of contents partially reset, and the preface on pp. 9–11 updated, re-titled (from “My Fifty Years with James Thurber”) and reset. The drawing on the title page is shifted from the half title of the Harper edition. Published November 1957. *WR* 2 December 1957. First printing: 15,000 copies. \n\nCerf had been trying to get *The Thurber Carnival* since 1946, when he offered a \\$6,000 advance to include it in the Giants (Cerf to William Rose, Jr., Harper & Bros., 24 January 1946). Harper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading for Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted” (Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10 percent of the retail price. *Brave New World* (485) was published in the ML in fall 1956. \n\nBowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D of the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month Club using duplicate plates supplied by Harper & Bros. In his list of variations that distinguish state D (p. 55), however, the nose of the dog on the fly title (p. [1]) is indicated as absent. The dog’s nose is present in all ML printings examined. \n\nThurber’s original preface was titled “My Fifty Years with James Thurber” and dated “December 6, 1944.” The re-titled preface in the ML edition, “My Sixty Years with James Thurber,” is identical to the original version except for changes in the first and next-to-last paragraphs. \n\n#### 496b. Reissue format (1979) \n\nTitle as 496a through line 7; line 8: [torchbearer M] THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK. \n\nPagination as 496a. Perfect bound. \n\nContents as 496a including *First* statement. \n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial on kraft paper with lettering in very deep purple (220) and torchbearer in deep brown (56). \n\n> Front flap:<br> As James Thurber writes in his introduction, “This book contains a selection of the stories and drawings the old boy did in his prime, a period which extended roughly from the year Lindbergh flew the Atlantic to the day coffee was rationed. He presents this to his readers with his sincere best wishes for a happy new world.” \n> This anthology draws from such Thurber classics as *My World and Welcome to It*, *Let Your Mind Alone*, *The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze*, *My Life and Hard Times*, *Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated*, *The Owl in the Attic*, *The Seal in the Bedroom*, and *Men, Women and Dogs*. \n\nPublished spring 1979 at \\$4.95.
