<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The twentieth century has been described as the century of man’s
discovery of himself. No one has contributed more in this respect than
Dr. C. G. Jung, whose ideas have exerted great influence upon all
branches of knowledge concerned with man and his society.</p>
<p>The publication of this volume of basic writings, skillfully edited by
Violet de Laszlo, provides for the first time a means by which general
readers can become acquainted with Dr. Jung’s major works. The reader
can look forward here to the pleasure and value of contact with one of
the most brilliant and prolific minds of our times. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published April 1959. <em>WR</em> 13 April 1959. First
printing: 7,500 copies.</p>
<p>Clifton Fadiman suggested a volume of Jung’s writings in 1956. He had
received a letter which stated: “You may know those who select the
titles for Modern Library Editions. Could you persuade them to publish
some of Dr. C. G. Jung’s writings. They are so scattered it is difficult
to obtain the more important parts.” Fadiman commented, “Not as crazy as
it sounds—the Jung cult is fairly large, the name better and better
known, and the Bollingen translations are good and easily buyable from
Kurt [Wolff, the founder of Pantheon Books]” (Fadiman to Klopfer, 13
April 1956). Klopfer replied, “We have been negotiating with the
Bollingen people for months, and expect to have a title in the Modern
Library in 1957” (Klopfer to Fadiman, 20 April 1956).</p>
