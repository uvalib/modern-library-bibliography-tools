<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Controversies over the merits of favorite short stories are endless.
Everyone is staunch in his own preferences and can argue at length in
their behalf. The tales collected in this volume support no theory,
nor do they follow a pattern intended to emphasize a special set of
virtues; they are catholic in choice and represent the most notable
works in the short-story form of such masters as Joseph Conrad, John
Galsworthy, Somerset Maugham, Katherine Mansfield, D. H. Lawrence,
Ernest Hemingway, Willa Cather, James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Sherwood Anderson and Glenway Westcott. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published January 1930. <em>WR</em> 8 February 1930.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1943. Superseded
1943 by <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em>, ed. Bennett Cerf (361).</p>
<p>Most of the stories were selected by Cerf and Klopfer rather than
Overton (see 361). Even so, Cerf thought that the anthology contained
“glaring defects” and acknowledged, “Copyright difficulties . . .
prevented our putting into this volume exactly what we would have liked
to include” (Cerf to A. E. Coppard, 6 September 1934).</p>
<p>Overton’s anthology and its successor sold 12,699 copies during the
18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it fourteenth out of 271
ML and Giant titles.</p>
