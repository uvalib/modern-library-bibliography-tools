<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in dark red (16), light bluish gray (190) and

lithograph “Departure of the Joads” from his Grapes of Wrath series;
lettering in dark red on light bluish gray background above and below
Benton illustration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No novel of our own time more certainly deserves the permanence
assured by inclusion in the Modern Library series than <em>The Grapes of
Wrath</em>. Universally hailed for its humanity and its power, this
odyssey of the Okies will long remain not only a fiery social
document, but will also endure as a magnificent work of literature.
<em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> is the fourth John Steinbeck novel on the Modern
Library shelf; the others are: <em>Tortilla Flat</em> (No. 216), <em>Of Mice and
Men</em> (No. 29) and <em>In Dubious Battle</em> (No. 115). (<em>Fall 1941</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A in light greenish gray (154) instead of light
bluish gray (<em>Fall 1958</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
Hailed for its humanity and power, this odyssey of the Okies as they
took flight westward from their dust-ruined land will long remain an
important social document. As a fictional account of a migration
unique in American history, it will endure as a magnificent work of
literature. <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> is the novel by which John Steinbeck
achieved his greatest fame. It is one of four of his books on the
Modern Library shelf. The other three are <em>Tortilla Flat</em> (No. 216),
<em>Of Mice and Men</em> (No. 29) and <em>In Dubious Battle</em> (No. 115). (<em>Spring
1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1939. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>]–619)
printed from Viking plates. Published October 1941. <em>WR</em> 4 October 1941.
First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1959.</p>
<p>The Viking Press edition led the best-seller list in 1939 with sales of
300,000 copies (Hackett and Burke, p. 127). The ML paid Viking Press a
$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for non-exclusive
reprint rights. There was a ML printing of 2,000 copies in December
1942; later printings included 4,000 copies each in May 1943 and June
1944.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 9,495 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,
placing <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> in the middle of the first quarter of ML
and Giant titles. Sales declined to 3,964 copies during the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952, placing it toward the bottom of the
first quarter of titles.</p>
<p>In Chapter 30 (the last chapter) of Viking Press printings, the number
of lines per page increases between the fifth printing (May 1939) and
ninth printing (September 1939). The first page of Chapter 30 (p. 593)
of the ninth printing has one more line than early printings; lines are
shifted forward throughout the chapter, with the result that the last
page of text (p. 619) has only four lines—five fewer than the fifth
printing. The reason for the shift has not been determined. The plates
used by the ML reflect the later configuration of Chapter 30.</p>
<p>The ML’s reprint contract appears to have been terminated in 1958 when
Viking Press published <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> in its quality paperback
series, Compass Books. The Modern Library edition was discontinued at
the end of 1959. Original publishers normally allowed the ML to sell out
its existing stock when a reprint contract was terminated.</p>
