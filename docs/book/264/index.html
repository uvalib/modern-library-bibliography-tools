<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Remembrance of Things Past</em> is the general title for the seven
magnificent novels of Marcel Proust. One by one, the independent parts
are being made available for Modern Library readers, all in the
masterful translations of C. K. Scott Moncrieff. . . . <em>The Guermantes
Way</em> is the third of the series. These novels should be read in their
proper order, that their subtlety and depth may be savored to the
full. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Thomas Seltzer, 1925;
reprinted 1928 by Albert &amp; Charles Boni. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>–<em>9</em>],
1–428; 1–395) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates in one volume with part
titles added and headings “Part I” and “Part II” added to the table of
contents. Published December 1933. <em>WR</em> 23 December 1933. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Fifteen months after the ML edition of <em>Within a Budding Grove</em> (194)
was published Cerf wrote to Albert Boni about adding <em>The Guermantes
Way</em> to the series in fall 1931 or spring 1932 (Cerf to Boni, 17 April
1931). Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set of
<em>Remembrance of Things Past</em> would be undermined if individual volumes
appeared in the ML too rapidly. Cerf approached him again a few months
later with an offer that he hoped would entice Boni to release the work
for publication in spring 1932. He offered an advance of $1,500 payable
immediately, or $2,000 with half paid on signing and the balance on
publication, against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Boni, 3 July
1931). The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year
and specified that the ML edition could not be published before October
1933. The ML paid Boni a $1,500 advance with $750 payable on signing
(Cerf to Boni, 23 November 1932).</p>
<p><em>Swann’s Way</em> (166) was the only Proust title to achieve consistently
good sales in the ML. <em>The Guermantes Way</em> sold 1,997 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth
worst-selling title. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. in two volumes by Thomas Seltzer, 1925;\nreprinted 1928 by Albert & Charles Boni. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*–*9*\\],\n1–428; 1–395) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates in one volume with part\ntitles added and headings “Part I” and “Part II” added to the table of\ncontents. Published December 1933. *WR* 23 December 1933. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nFifteen months after the ML edition of *Within a Budding Grove* (194)\nwas published Cerf wrote to Albert Boni about adding *The Guermantes\nWay* to the series in fall 1931 or spring 1932 (Cerf to Boni, 17 April\n1931). Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set of\n*Remembrance of Things Past* would be undermined if individual volumes\nappeared in the ML too rapidly. Cerf approached him again a few months\nlater with an offer that he hoped would entice Boni to release the work\nfor publication in spring 1932. He offered an advance of $1,500 payable\nimmediately, or $2,000 with half paid on signing and the balance on\npublication, against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Boni, 3 July\n1931). The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year\nand specified that the ML edition could not be published before October\n1933. The ML paid Boni a $1,500 advance with $750 payable on signing\n(Cerf to Boni, 23 November 1932).\n\n*Swann’s Way* (166) was the only Proust title to achieve consistently\ngood sales in the ML. *The Guermantes Way* sold 1,997 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth\nworst-selling title.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. in two volumes by Thomas Seltzer, 1925;\nreprinted 1928 by Albert & Charles Boni. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*–*9*\\],\n1–428; 1–395) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates in one volume with part\ntitles added and headings “Part I” and “Part II” added to the table of\ncontents. Published December 1933. *WR* 23 December 1933. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nFifteen months after the ML edition of *Within a Budding Grove* (194)\nwas published Cerf wrote to Albert Boni about adding *The Guermantes\nWay* to the series in fall 1931 or spring 1932 (Cerf to Boni, 17 April\n1931). Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set of\n*Remembrance of Things Past* would be undermined if individual volumes\nappeared in the ML too rapidly. Cerf approached him again a few months\nlater with an offer that he hoped would entice Boni to release the work\nfor publication in spring 1932. He offered an advance of $1,500 payable\nimmediately, or $2,000 with half paid on signing and the balance on\npublication, against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Boni, 3 July\n1931). The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year\nand specified that the ML edition could not be published before October\n1933. The ML paid Boni a $1,500 advance with $750 payable on signing\n(Cerf to Boni, 23 November 1932).\n\n*Swann’s Way* (166) was the only Proust title to achieve consistently\ngood sales in the ML. *The Guermantes Way* sold 1,997 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth\nworst-selling title.
