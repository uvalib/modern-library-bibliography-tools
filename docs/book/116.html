<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe’s volume is one of the rare books which represent a
positive addition to the sum total of genuine literature. It is not
merely a ‘book of the season’ or ‘book of the year’; it will stand on
the shelves of cultivated people, of people whose taste in reading is
both wide and good, as long as men and women appreciate charm of form
in the writings of men who also combine love of daring adventure with
the power to observe and vividly to record the things of strange
interest which they have seen. . . . If I had space I would like to
give an abstract of the whole book. As it is I merely advise all who
love good books, very good books, at once to get this book of Mr.
Beebe’s.” THEODORE ROOSEVELT (<em>Fall 1925</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br><br>
As a trained scientific observer, William Beebe has conducted many
expeditions at sea and into the jungle. The wealth of data collected
by him and the vivid tales of adventure he has brought back constitute
a record unique among books of exploration. In <em>Jungle Peace</em> he
describes a remote and glamorous segment of the world —Guiana — and
creates a picture of tropical splendor and mystery. He tells of birds
and beasts, plants and insects with the accuracy of the scientist and
the wonder of a born story-teller. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
