<p>Front flap:<br>
In 1934, when <em>The Children’s Hour</em> was first produced and published,
American playgoers and readers became aware of a challenging new
dramatist who could make of the most delicate of themes a play of
force and ringing conviction. Since then Lillian Hellman has advanced
her reputation as one of America’s leading playwrights. Each new work
reveals a wider sympathy and mounting power. This volume contains all
her plays to date in their complete and unabridged texts: <em>The
Children’s Hour</em>, <em>Days to Come</em>, <em>The Little Foxes</em> and <em>Watch on the
Rhine</em>. In addition, Miss Hellman contributes an introduction
specially written for this Modern Library edition. (<em>Spring 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“This volume contains an introduction by Miss Hellman and six of her
plays in their complete and unabridged texts: <em>The Children’s Hour</em>,
<em>Days to Come</em>, <em>The Little Foxes</em>, <em>Watch on the Rhine</em>, <em>Another
Part of the Forest</em>, and <em>The Autumn Garden</em>.” (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Another Part of the Forest</em> and <em>The Autumn Garden</em> were added at
Hellman’s request. Klopfer assured Hellman that <em>Four Plays</em> would not
be reprinted until the ML received the additions she wanted to make; at
that time the ML had a ten-month supply of the volume (Klopfer to
Hellman, 23 November 1959). The additional text was at the proof stage
when Klopfer asked Hellman if rights to the two plays had reverted to
her (Klopfer to Hellman, 13 May 1960).</p>

This volume contains all\n> her plays to date in their complete and unabridged texts: *The\n> Children’s Hour*, *Days to Come*, *The Little Foxes* and *Watch on the\n> Rhine*. In addition, Miss Hellman contributes an introduction\n> specially written for this Modern Library edition.
