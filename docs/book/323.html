INTRODUCTION | By Howard Mumford Jones dated p. xxii: <em>Harvard
University</em> | <em>July, 1939</em>; xxiii–xxxi <em>Author’s Preface</em>; [xxxii]
blank; xxxiii–xxxviii <em>Contents</em>; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–422
text; [423–426] blank.</p>
<p><em>Format:</em> 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. (181 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and the
variant Blumenthal binding without the torchbearer on the front panel.
The binding appears to have been used only for first printings of the
two new titles published in October 1939, Fielding, <em>Joseph Andrews</em> and
Fineman, <em>Hear Ye Sons</em> (324).</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in light blue (181) on coated white paper with
lettering and decoration in reverse on front panel and spine. Probably
designed by Joseph Blumenthal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Convinced that Fielding’s <em>Joseph Andrews</em> will take its place in
general popularity beside his universally read <em>Tom Jones</em> (No. 185),
the editors take pleasure in adding this immortal satire to the Modern
Library series. Full-bodied, broadly humorous, this swift-paced
classic is a biting commentary on the pretenses and foibles of
eighteenth-century England, and is as fresh and vivid today as it was
when written. It is doubtful if its array of characters has ever been
surpassed in English fiction for brilliance, economy and variety.
(<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
October 1939. <em>WR</em> 14 October 1939. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Cerf appears to have asked Henry C. Moriarty, manager of the book
department of the Harvard Cooperative Society, to suggest someone to
write the introduction. Moriarty suggested Howard Mumford Jones, a
professor of English at Harvard. When Cerf contacted Jones he explained
that the ML could “only pay $50 for forewords because of the small
margin of profit on which the library is operated. On the other hand,
there are no stipulations whatever as to the length of the foreword or
contents thereof” (Cerf to Jones, 8 June 1939). Jones suggested George
Sherwood of Columbia University as better qualified, but after a second
letter from Cerf he agreed to write the introduction himself.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 2,823 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,
placing it in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles. It was not
among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Flap text rewritten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fielding himself described <em>Joseph</em> <em>Andrews</em> as a satire “in
imitation of the manner of Cervantes.” Its original purpose was to
heap ridicule on the then popular romantic heroine of Samuel
Richardson’s <em>Pamela</em>. But the novel grew beyond its first intention
and became more than a mere parody. In its own right it earned the
status of one of the major works of fiction of the mid-eighteenth
century and was the forerunner of Fielding’s masterpiece, <em>Tom Jones</em>
(Modern Library No. 185). Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on
the pretenses and follies of English society, <em>Joseph Andrews</em> is a
novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and
sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the
master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired.
(<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.</p>
<p>When <em>Joseph Andrews</em> was included on the first list of titles to be
published in MLCE, Stein offered Jones $75 to add a bibliography and
invited him to look over the introduction to see if he would like to
make any changes (Stein to Jones, 27 January 1950). Jones made only a
few small changes.</p>

Published\nOctober 1939. *WR* 14 October 1939. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nCerf appears to have asked Henry C. Moriarty, manager of the book\ndepartment of the Harvard Cooperative Society, to suggest someone to\nwrite the introduction. Moriarty suggested Howard Mumford Jones, a\nprofessor of English at Harvard. When Cerf contacted Jones he explained\nthat the ML could “only pay $50 for forewords because of the small\nmargin of profit on which the library is operated. On the other hand,\nthere are no stipulations whatever as to the length of the foreword or\ncontents thereof” (Cerf to Jones, 8 June 1939). Jones suggested George\nSherwood of Columbia University as better qualified, but after a second\nletter from Cerf he agreed to write the introduction himself.\n\nThe ML edition sold 2,823 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing it in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles. It was not\namong the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the\ntwelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 323b.
