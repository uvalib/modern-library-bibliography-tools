<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For almost sixteen centuries <em>The Confessions of Saint Augustine</em> has
stood unchallenged among autobiographies as the most moving and
profound outpouring of man’s soul to God. To Catholic readers it goes
to the heart of their faith and to more and more Protestants it has
become the book by which sectarian differences can be resolved. By
both it is acknowledged a literary masterpiece. Included in every list
of great books for students and general readers, <em>The Confessions</em>,
complete and unabridged in the E. B. Pusey translation and with a
stirring Introduction by Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, now takes a proud
and permanent place in the Modern Library series. (<em>Spring 1949</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
spring 1949. <em>WR</em> 25 June 1949. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>The Pusey translation, originally published in 1838, appears to have
been recommended by Sheen. The ML’s spring 1949 catalog announced <em>The
Confessions of Saint Augustine</em> in the J. G. Pilkington translation, but
Commins asked Sheen to indicate which of the two translations he
preferred (Commins to Sheen, 16 November 1948). Cerf believed that the
imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked
Sheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen
did not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would
affect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to
contact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949). The Church approved the
introduction but declined to give an imprimatur since Pusey was not a
Catholic and his translation had not been submitted to the censor.</p>
<p>Sales totaled 59,736 copies by spring 1958.</p>
