<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Frank Norris lived to complete only two-thirds of his planned trilogy,
<em>The Epic of Wheat</em>. <em>The Pit</em>, which is the second volume, created a
national furor and established Norris as the first and one of the
greatest realists in America. Today <em>The Pit</em> is not only a startling
exposé of the machinations of stock gamblers in the fundamental
necessity of life, but also an authentic picture of the frenzied
struggle for power that marked the end of American pioneer days and
the beginnings of its ventures in world markets. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1903. New bibliographical
edition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co.,
1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML
edition (pp. [v]–403) printed from offset plates photographically
reduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934. <em>WR</em> 25 August
1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
31 December 1940.</p>
<p>Robert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary,
was inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris in <em>Saturday Review
of Literature</em> (27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML
(de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML
edition of Norris’s <em>McTeague</em> or <em>The</em> <em>Octopus</em> three years earlier
(Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff
sent copies of <em>The Pit</em> and <em>McTeague</em> for his consideration. He noted
that <em>The Pit</em> had sold 189,455 copies in all editions while <em>McTeague</em>
had sold 67,272 copies and <em>The Octopus</em> had sold 59,779 copies (de
Graff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided that <em>The Pit</em>
“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July
1933). He appears to have been unaware that <em>McTeague</em> (57) was in the
ML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni
&amp; Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.</p>
<p>The plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition of <em>The Pit</em> were too large for
the ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would
have to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would
share the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think,
making some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.).
Meanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original
plates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the
Modern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios
in small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty
bad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you
think, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent
looking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing
Co., 29 August 1933).</p>
<p>Publication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed
until August; Dickens’s <em>David Copperfield</em> (269), originally scheduled
for August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production of
<em>The Pit</em> appears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end
of April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to
use” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was
made to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928
Argonaut edition. <em>The Pit</em> appears to have been the first ML title
printed by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive
than letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but
it would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and
make new letterpress plates.</p>
<p>Sales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing. <em>The Pit</em> was
discontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first
ML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on
the endpaper.</p>

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1903. New bibliographical\nedition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran & Co.,\n1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML\nedition (pp. \\[v\\]–403) printed from offset plates photographically\nreduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934. *WR* 25 August\n1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n31 December 1940.\n\nRobert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary,\nwas inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris in *Saturday Review\nof Literature* (27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML\n(de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML\nedition of Norris’s *McTeague* or *The* *Octopus* three years earlier\n(Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff\nsent copies of *The Pit* and *McTeague* for his consideration. He noted\nthat *The Pit* had sold 189,455 copies in all editions while *McTeague*\nhad sold 67,272 copies and *The Octopus* had sold 59,779 copies (de\nGraff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided that *The Pit*\n“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July\n1933). He appears to have been unaware that *McTeague* (57) was in the\nML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni\n& Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.\n\nThe plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition of *The Pit* were too large for\nthe ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would\nhave to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would\nshare the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think,\nmaking some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.).\nMeanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original\nplates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the\nModern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios\nin small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty\nbad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you\nthink, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent\nlooking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing\nCo., 29 August 1933).\n\nPublication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed\nuntil August; Dickens’s *David Copperfield* (269), originally scheduled\nfor August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production of\n*The Pit* appears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end\nof April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to\nuse” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was\nmade to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928\nArgonaut edition. *The Pit* appears to have been the first ML title\nprinted by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive\nthan letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but\nit would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and\nmake new letterpress plates.\n\nSales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing. *The Pit* was\ndiscontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first\nML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on\nthe endpaper.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nNorris, *McTeague* (1918–1922) 57",
