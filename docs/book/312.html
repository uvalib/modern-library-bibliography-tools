<p>Front flap:<br> For 2,500 years the writings of China’s great sage have represented the moral principles as well as the day-to-day standards of conduct for countless millions of people in the East. Today, as much as ever, his doctrines influence the way of life of the most populous nation on earth. A completely new English text has been prepared for the Modern Library edition of <em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> under the editorship of Dr. Lin Yutang, the foremost interpreter of ancient and modern China in America today. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published April 1938. <em>WR</em> 9 April 1938. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Several months before <em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> was published Cerf wrote to a publishers’ representative in New Zealand, “I call your particular attention to the Confucius volume, edited by Lin Yutang. I think this will prove one of the most popular titles we have ever had, and we expect about three times the normal advance sale on it” (Cerf to Nash &amp; Kissling, 17 November 1937). Cerf’s prediction was correct. <em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> was one of the ML’s best-selling titles. In 1942 it was the third best-selling title in the series.</p>
<p>While working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough to think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on Confucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and besides the introduction, it will be principally the work of translating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript will be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January 1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s financial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He received $300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April 1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a flat fee or was an advance against royalties.</p>
<p>Lin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did not read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the collection appears to have been challenged. In 1939 Random House paid $250 for all rights to Miles Menander Dawson’s <em>The Conduct of Life (The Ethics of Confucius)</em>, originally published by International Press in 1915.</p>
<p><em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> sold 12,000 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it seventeenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. Sales declined by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 4,036 copies, making it sixty-first out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>

<p>In 1945 the word “Jewish” was removed from the following sentence: “[Confucius] could sing and be extremely polite, but he also could hate and sneer with the hatred and contempt of a ‘real man,’ which was shared by Jesus in his hatred of the Jewish scribes” (p. 27, line 16). Freiman asked that the word be eliminated from the plates of both the regular ML and Illustrated ML editions (Freiman to Parkway Printing, 21 May 1945).</p>
<p><em>The Wisdom of Confucius</em> was shifted from ML 7 to ML 306 in fall 1959 when the six-volume Shakespeare was renumbered ML 2–7.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> “Confucianism stood for a rationalized social order through the ethical approach, based on personal cultivation. It aimed at political order by laying the basis for it in a moral order, and it sought political harmony by trying to achieve the moral harmony in man himself. . . . Fundamentally, it was a humanist attitude, brushing aside all futile metaphysics and mysticism, interested chiefly in the essential human relationships, and not in the world of spirits or in immortality. The strongest doctrine of this particular type of humanism, which accounts for its great enduring influence, is the doctrine that ‘the measure of man is man,’ a doctrine which makes it possible for the common man to begin somewhere as a follower of Confucianism by merely following the highest instincts of his own human nature, and not by looking for perfection in a divine ideal.”</p>

Designed by Paul Galdone, December 1937; unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> For 2,500 years the writings of China’s great sage have represented the moral principles as well as the day-to-day standards of conduct for countless millions of people in the East. Today, as much as ever, his doctrines influence the way of life of the most populous nation on earth. A completely new English text has been prepared for the Modern Library edition of *The Wisdom of Confucius* under the editorship of Dr. Lin Yutang, the foremost interpreter of ancient and modern China in America today. (*Spring 1938*)   \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1938. *WR* 9 April 1938. First printing: Not ascertained.   \n\nSeveral months before *The Wisdom of Confucius* was published Cerf wrote to a publishers’ representative in New Zealand, “I call your particular attention to the Confucius volume, edited by Lin Yutang. I think this will prove one of the most popular titles we have ever had, and we expect about three times the normal advance sale on it” (Cerf to Nash & Kissling, 17 November 1937). Cerf’s prediction was correct. *The Wisdom of Confucius* was one of the ML’s best-selling titles. In 1942 it was the third best-selling title in the series.   \n\nWhile working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough to think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on Confucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and besides the introduction, it will be principally the work of translating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript will be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January 1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s financial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He received \\$300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April 1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a flat fee or was an advance against royalties.   \n\nLin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did not read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the collection appears to have been challenged. In 1939 Random House paid \\$250 for all rights to Miles Menander Dawson’s *The Conduct of Life (The Ethics of Confucius)*, originally published by International Press in 1915.   \n\n*The Wisdom of Confucius* sold 12,000 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it seventeenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. Sales declined by the early 1950s.

Today, as much as ever, his doctrines influence the way of life of the most populous nation on earth. The English text was prepared for the Modern Library edition under the editorship of Lin Yutang. His Introduction clarifies for the Western reader the great ethical teachings of Confucius.   \n\nIn 1945 the word “Jewish” was removed from the following sentence: “[Confucius] could sing and be extremely polite, but he also could hate and sneer with the hatred and contempt of a ‘real man,’ which was shared by Jesus in his hatred of the Jewish scribes” (p. 27, line 16). Freiman asked that the word be eliminated from the plates of both the regular ML and Illustrated ML editions (Freiman to Parkway Printing, 21 May 1945).   \n\n*The Wisdom of Confucius* was shifted from ML 7 to ML 306 in fall 1959 when the six-volume Shakespeare was renumbered ML 2–7.   \n\n####  312.2.

Designed by R. D. Scudellari.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> “Confucianism stood for a rationalized social order through the ethical approach, based on personal cultivation. It aimed at political order by laying the basis for it in a moral order, and it sought political harmony by trying to achieve the moral harmony in man himself. . . . Fundamentally, it was a humanist attitude, brushing aside all futile metaphysics and mysticism, interested chiefly in the essential human relationships, and not in the world of spirits or in immortality. The strongest doctrine of this particular type of humanism, which accounts for its great enduring influence, is the doctrine that ‘the measure of man is man,’ a doctrine which makes it possible for the common man to begin somewhere as a follower of Confucianism by merely following the highest instincts of his own human nature, and not by looking for perfection in a divine ideal.”   \n\nPublished spring 1977 at \\$4.95.
