retained on several later printings.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in dark yellowish green (137), vivid reddish orange

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
As American a book as <em>Tom Sawyer</em> or <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>, <em>The
Yearling</em> has achieved for itself within a few years a permanent place
in our national literature. It is a novel of living characters in an
unforgettable setting, with a wisdom as simple as it is tender and a
charm as natural as it is winning. The story of Jody Baxter and his
pet fawn is American folklore at its best. <em>The Yearling</em> is a novel
that stirs the heart with its understanding of boyhood and its love of
life. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1938. New
bibliographical edition with illustrations by N. C. Wyeth published as
“Pulitzer Prize Edition,” 1939, and in Scribner Illustrated Classics for
Younger Readers, 1940. ML edition (pp. 1–400) printed from offset
lithographic plates photographically reduced from the 1939 Scribner
edition with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September
1946. <em>WR</em> 4 January 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
spring 1954.</p>
<p>The ML paid Scribner’s royalties of 10 cents a copy on all copies sold
over 30,000. The royalty on the first 30,000 copies appears to have been
reduced or waived to cover the cost of making offset plates. Sales
appear to have exceeded 30,000 copies since the ML paid Scribner’s
royalties of $235 on sales of 2,355 copies sold after 30 October 1953
(Klopfer to Ruth Riggs, Scribner’s, 16 July 1954).</p>
<p>The ML’s reprint contract was limited to six years. After receiving a
report of sales through October 1953 and noting that <em>The Yearling</em> was
included on the ML’s spring 1954 list, Whitney Darrow of Scribner’s
reminded Cerf that the book was supposed to have been dropped from the
series by October 1952 (Darrow to Cerf, 19 April 1954). Klopfer replied
that <em>The Yearling</em> had stayed on the spring 1954 list by mistake and as
a result it had not been necessary to remainder any copies. He assured
Darrow that it was out of stock and would be replaced on the fall list
by Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric &amp; Poetics</em> (Klopfer to Darrow, 20 April 1954).</p>
<p><em>The Yearling</em> was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period, November 1952–October 1953.</p>
