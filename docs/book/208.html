<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
It is now almost two hundred years since Henry Fielding developed in
<em>Tom Jones</em> a new approach and a new field for the novel. Treasured as
one of the greatest achievements in the literature of fiction, it
retains all the vitality and contemporaneity of the eternally human.
Its unrestrained commentaries on the life of the period, its ridicule
of the pretensions and its tolerance of the frailties of mankind, its
naturalness and its unforgettable characters, assure the permanence of
<em>Tom Jones</em> through the ages. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> As 208.1b with front flap rewritten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Henry Fielding’s story of a foundling is now more than two hundred
years old, but still it has the vitality and appeal it had for its
readers in the middle of the eighteenth century. Then, with few
predecessors, Fielding created his own form and brought forth a
pioneer work of English fiction. Now, with countless imitators, his
book is read with the kind of appreciation one reserves for a novel
that understands the ageless frailties of mankind and forgives them. A
book that makes pretensions ridiculous and shows tolerance for
weakness is ageless. <em>Tom Jones</em> is remembered with affection by
readers of every variety for its complete naturalness and for its
vivid characters. After two centuries the permanence of Henry
Fielding’s novel is assured. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except on coated white paper with title and
author in dark yellow (88) on inset white panel and background in
moderate red (15). (<em>Fall 1963</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.
Sherburn received $200 for the introduction (Stein to Sherburn, 24
January 1950). Edmund H. Booth of Dartmouth College pointed out errors
in the reset text that were corrected for the MLCE edition (Booth to
Cerf, 30 May 1950).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Ever since its publication in 1749, <em>Tom Jones</em> has been a classic of
English literature. Unforgettable characters and episodes emerge in
its pages: Tom himself—loving, high-spirited, brimming with impetuous
vigor; irascible Squire Western with his dogs and drink; Sophia
Western, who sees through sham with a gentle “Fie!,” and marvelously
understands how to manage her prickly father; Mr. Allworthy, seeker of
justice, blinded by his own good heart; Square the philosopher; Mr.
Thwackum the divine; the black Blifil; and the author himself,
permeating every page with kindly admonitions, scorn of hypocrisy, and
admiration of the true virtue found in clarity of vision and a prudent
disciplining of the spontaneous urgings of one’s own good nature.
Picaresque novel, comic mock epic in prose, <em>Tom Jones</em> ranks in the
forefront of world literature.</p>

Then, with few\n> predecessors, Fielding created his own form and brought forth a\n> pioneer work of English fiction. Now, with countless imitators, his\n> book is read with the kind of appreciation one reserves for a novel\n> that understands the ageless frailties of mankind and forgives them. A\n> book that makes pretensions ridiculous and shows tolerance for\n> weakness is ageless. *Tom Jones* is remembered with affection by\n> readers of every variety for its complete naturalness and for its\n> vivid characters. After two centuries the permanence of Henry\n> Fielding’s novel is assured. (*Fall 1956*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except on coated white paper with title and\nauthor in dark yellow (88) on inset white panel and background in\nmoderate red (15).

Unforgettable characters and episodes emerge in\n> its pages: Tom himself—loving, high-spirited, brimming with impetuous\n> vigor; irascible Squire Western with his dogs and drink; Sophia\n> Western, who sees through sham with a gentle “Fie!,” and marvelously\n> understands how to manage her prickly father; Mr. Allworthy, seeker of\n> justice, blinded by his own good heart; Square the philosopher; Mr.\n> Thwackum the divine; the black Blifil; and the author himself,\n> permeating every page with kindly admonitions, scorn of hypocrisy, and\n> admiration of the true virtue found in clarity of vision and a prudent\n> disciplining of the spontaneous urgings of one’s own good nature.\n> Picaresque novel, comic mock epic in prose, *Tom Jones* ranks in the\n> forefront of world literature.",
