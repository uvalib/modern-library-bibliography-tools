<p>Front flap:<br>
For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have planned to
include in the series the entire text of Plato’s <em>The Republic</em> in the
definitive Jowett version. That plan is now achieved in the fullest
measure in this volume, which not only provides the complete and
unabridged translation of the most famous of the Socratic dialogues,
but also gives all of Jowett’s marginalia and references. Here, for
student and general reader alike, is Plato’s forever timely
description of the ideal commonwealth. (<em>Fall 1941</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except in moderate blue (182) instead of strong

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
The entire text of Plato’s <em>The Republic</em> in the Benjamin Jowett
translation is made available in the Modern Library series. At a time
when interest in government, local and national, is of critical
importance, the most famous of the Socratic dialogues offers guidance
in the principles under which man can live in amity with his
fellow-man. Now, just as it had four centuries before the Christian
era, Plato’s description of the ideal commonwealth has a special
timeliness; it outlines a pattern of government that free men can
follow with trust and conviction. This edition includes, in addition
to the complete and unabridged text, the Jowett references and
marginal notes. (<em>Fall 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No philosopher has had as profound an influence on the history of
Western thought as Plato, and perhaps no one work has shaped our
conception of the ideal society as much as Plato’s <em>Republic</em>. The
most important of the Socratic dialogues, the <em>Republic</em> is concerned
with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place
as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the
word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes
various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But
above all, the <em>Republic</em> is an attempt to define “justice”; by
imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to
see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows
himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.</p>
<p>The text used here is the classic Jowett translation, complete and
unabridged, with notes and marginalia for the student, scholar, and
general reader alike.</p>
