<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform Aristotle jacket in moderate greenish blue (173) and

jacket title “The Rhetoric and The Poetics of Aristotle” and
left-profile portrait of Aristotle in black and moderate greenish blue;
moderate greenish blue band below center with lettering in black;
thinner band at foot with series in moderate greenish blue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For more than two thousand years, the <em>Rhetoric</em> and the <em>Poetics</em> of
Aristotle have enjoyed the zealous acclaim of some readers and endured
the hostile scrutiny of others. But, in any case, few words of
antiquity have had more constant influence in Western thought than
have these writings. It has long been the hope of the editors of the
Modern Library to include these works in complete form, and now
permission to use the distinguished Oxford translations by Roberts and
Bywater makes this book possible. To it, Professor Solmsen has
contributed a distinguished introduction and a body of helpful notes.
(<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 29 January 1955. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The Bywater translation of <em>Poetics</em> was originally published by the
Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1909; the Roberts translation of <em>Rhetoric</em>
was originally published by the Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1924. The ML
paid Clarendon Press a $300 advance on the first 10,000 copies and
royalties of 5 percent of the list price thereafter. Solmsen received a
flat fee of $300 for his work on the ML edition. Stein found Solmsen’s
English a bit clumsy and sent the introduction to Sidney Kaplan at the
University of Massachusetts for stylistic improvement and clarification.
Kaplan received $30 for this work.</p>
<p>“The selection from the notes to the Roberts and Bywater edition has
been made by Professor Solmsen, who has also made the emendations
enclosed by brackets” (p. [iv]).</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Enlarged version of 469a with Fujita “ml” symbol added to

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few works of antiquity have had a more constant influence in Western
thought than Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric</em> and <em>Poetics</em>. For the
distinguished Oxford translations by W. Rhys Roberts and Ingram
Bywater, Professor Friedrich Solmsen has provided an introduction
examining these two works in the context of the ideas of Aristotle’s
contemporaries, and has made substantial additions to the original
notes by the translators.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Here is the complete text of two of Aristotle’s most important and
influential works, in the famous and authoritative Oxford translations
by W. Rhys Roberts and Ingram Bywater. Aristotle’s intention when he
composed the <em>Poetics</em> was to set up standards of literary excellence,
and in the <em>Rhetoric</em> he sought to establish standards of effective
public speaking. For more than two thousand years the <em>Rhetoric</em> and
the <em>Poetics</em> have met with both hostile scrutiny and zealous acclaim;
few works of antiquity have had more constant influence in Western
thought.</p>
