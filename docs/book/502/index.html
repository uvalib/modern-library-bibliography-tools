<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few men have been more widely read—and more misinterpreted—than
Jonathan Swift. He did, it is true, call himself a misanthrope and
many readers have been quick to regard him solely as a brooding,
embittered critic of mankind.</p>
<p>Actually, he was an intensely loyal, warm person in his private life
and an active, ardent participant in worldly affairs, using his great
satiric pen with positive effects on many controversial issues.
Readers of <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> already know that the narrative charm
of that book is merely one aspect of a work infinitely rich in
observation and wisdom. And the broad variety of matters that engaged
Swift’s brilliantly incisive mind is fully represented in the many
other masterpieces of prose and poetry in this volume. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
One of the greatest satirists in the English language, Jonathan Swift
continues to speak to succeeding generations. In addition to his
masterpiece, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>—a devastating picture of human
nature and human foibles—this volume contains his scathing attack on
religious excesses, <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>; his defense of the classics,
<em>The Battle of the Books</em>; and his unforgettable <em>Modest Proposal</em>
that, in order to avoid starvation, the Irish eat their children. The
selections from his letters, essays and poems reveal another side of
one of the most brilliant minds in English literature.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
One of the unique books of world literature, GULLIVER’S TRAVELS
describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship’s
surgeon, first to Lilliput, a land inhabited by tiny people whose
diminutive size renders all their pompous activities absurd; next to
Brobdingnag, a republic of giants who are amused when Gulliver tells
them about the glories of England; then to Laputa and its neighbor
Lagado, peopled by quack philosophers and scientists; and finally to
the land of the Houhynhnms, where horses behave with reason and
control men, known as Yahoos, who behave like animals. A savage satire
on man and his institutions, written with great wit and invention,
<em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> has captivated readers for the past two
centuries. This volume also includes the three other Swift
masterpieces: <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>, <em>The Battle of the Books</em> and <em>A
Modest Proposal</em>.</p>
