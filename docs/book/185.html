<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in dark red (16) and black on grayish paper with
inset illustration of Casanova holding a candlestick in one hand and
opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle casts a shadow of
a satyr on the door; lettering in dark red. Signed: Wuyts. (<em>Spring
1929</em>) <em>Note</em>: <em>The Memoirs of Casanova</em> appears to be the first ML
title to have been published initially in a pictorial jacket without the
option of a uniform typographic jacket.</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in very deep red (14) and black on grayish paper
with inset illustration from jacket A; lettering in black, borders in
very deep red. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The pursuit of women and adventure was the chief activity of
Casanova’s life. Amorous and exciting exploits demanded all his energy
and ability. When old age tempered his audacity, he retired to write
the nostalgic recollections of his youthful prowess. The manuscript
which has come down to us in various condensations has been the joy of
those who cultivate delectable but forbidden pleasures, as it has been
anathema and despair to prudes. The Modern Library edition includes
the most vivid encounters and escapades of a glamorous life. (<em>Fall
1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unidentified translation edited and probably abridged for the ML by
Madeleine Boyd. Published November 1929. <em>WR</em> 21 December 1929. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The ML sold exclusive reprint rights to the Madeleine Boyd edition to
Garden City Publishing Co. for $1,500. The ML supplied duplicate plates
(omitting the introduction) and retained all rights to publish its own
edition (Robert F. de Graff, Garden City, to Cerf, 22 January 1932). A
full-sized edition with illustrations by Victor Candell was published by
Garden City later that year under the imprint Sun Dial Press.</p>
<p><em>The Memoirs of Jacques Casanova</em> ranked in the 3rd quarter of ML titles
in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It
was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in light bluish green (163) and black on textured
white paper depicting a man and woman on the steps of a villa,
illuminated by moonlight; lettering in black with title highlighted in
light bluish green. Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1940; signed. Front

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
The pursuit of women and adventure was the principal activity of
Casanova’s life. By his own account, amorous and other exciting
exploits demanded virtually all of his energy and resourcefulness.
When old age tempered his passions, he retired to write the
recollections of his youthful escapades. The manuscript which has come
down to us from the eighteenth century in various condensations has
delighted those readers who cultivate an interest in accounts of
forbidden pleasures. It has also brought a little discomfort to the
prudish-minded. This edition includes some of the most vivid
encounters and escapades of Casanova’s crowded life. (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>
