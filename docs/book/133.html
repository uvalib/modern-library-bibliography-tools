<p>Text on front:<br>
“I consider Hawthorne the most consummate literary artist in American
literature, and ‘The Scarlet Letter’ the greatest book ever written in
the Western Hemisphere. It holds its place among the fifteen best
novels of the world.” — <em>William Lyon Phelps</em></p>
<p>The inclusion of “The Scarlett Letter” in this series adds the name of
Hawthorne to a roster of American authors that already contains Poe,
Whitman, James, Melville, Dreiser, Anderson, Hearn, Crane, Bierce,
O’Neill, Hecht and Beebe. As many more American works will be added as
can be found to be consistent with the standards of the Modern
Library. <em>(Spring 1927)</em></p>
<p>Front flap as Jacket B except has misspelling “Phrynne.” (<em>Spring
1927</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the few authors who have escaped the iconoclastic onslaughts of
modern criticism, Nathaniel Hawthorne stands unassailed and with
undiminished prestige among America’s immortals. Generations of
readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power of <em>The
Scarlet Letter</em>. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude
toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction
and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of
life, the story of Hester Phrynne [<em>sic</em>] has inevitably become part
of our national legacy. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>When Cerf invited Phelps to write the introduction he indicated that
<em>The Scarlet Letter</em> was being added to the series as part of “our
endeavor to include . . . as many great American works as possible” and
reminded the Yale professor that the ML had no introduction by him (Cerf
to Phelps, 5 October 1926). Phelps missed the 15 November deadline by
nearly a month and offered to waive the $50 fee (Phelps to Cerf, 12
December 1926), but Cerf sent it to him anyway.</p>
<p>The text of 133.1 is that of the second edition (Clark, p. 162).</p>
<p><em>The Scarlet Letter</em> did not rank among the 99 best-selling ML titles
during the first six months of 1928. During the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales. It ranked high in the second quarter if ML titles by the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

It holds its place among the fifteen best\n> novels of the world.” — *William Lyon Phelps*\n>\n> The inclusion of “The Scarlett Letter” in this series adds the name of\n> Hawthorne to a roster of American authors that already contains Poe,\n> Whitman, James, Melville, Dreiser, Anderson, Hearn, Crane, Bierce,\n> O’Neill, Hecht and Beebe.

(*Fall 1929*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Of the few authors who have escaped the iconoclastic onslaughts of\n> modern criticism, Nathaniel Hawthorne stands unassailed and with\n> undiminished prestige among America’s immortals. Generations of\n> readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power of *The\n> Scarlet Letter*. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude\n> toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction\n> and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of\n> life, the story of Hester Phrynne \\[*sic*\\] has inevitably become part\n> of our national legacy. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nFebruary 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nWhen Cerf invited Phelps to write the introduction he indicated that\n*The Scarlet Letter* was being added to the series as part of “our\nendeavor to include . . . as many great American works as possible” and\nreminded the Yale professor that the ML had no introduction by him (Cerf\nto Phelps, 5 October 1926). Phelps missed the 15 November deadline by\nnearly a month and offered to waive the $50 fee (Phelps to Cerf, 12\nDecember 1926), but Cerf sent it to him anyway.\n\nThe text of 133.1 is that of the second edition (Clark, p. 162).\n\n*The Scarlet Letter* did not rank among the 99 best-selling ML titles\nduring the first six months of 1928. During the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales. It ranked high in the second quarter if ML titles by the 12-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 133.1b.
