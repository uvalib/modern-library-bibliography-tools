<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
In this novel—which the editors of the Modern Library consider one of
the greatest in the English language—Thomas Hardy reaches the high
water mark of his glorious genius. There are scenes in this book, and
characters, that will burn themselves into the memory of the reader,
never to be forgotten; passages of writing whose sheer beauty is
unsurpassed in all literature. “The Return of the Native” is dominated
by the tragic overtones of the Hardy conviction of inevitability—the
powerlessness of man before his fate. (<em>Spring 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1878. New
bibliographical edition with Hardy’s 1895 Preface and map of Hardy’s
Wessex published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1895; plates used for successive
Harper printings, including a 1922 printing in Harper’s Modern Classics.
ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>]–[509]) printed from Harper plates. Published
August 1926. <em>WR</em> 20 November 1926. First printing: 7,000 copies.
Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p><em>The Return of the Native</em> was the fourth best-selling title in the ML
during the first six months of 1928. It ranked low in the first quarter
of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 and the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 4 cents a copy. Sales of the ML
edition totaled 42,543 copies by December 1930. Printings between August
1931 and November 1939 totaled at least 24,000 copies.</p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B. Text on front as 126a. (<em>Fall

<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial expressionist jacket in light brown (57) and dark
gray on tan paper depicting a male figure walking through a stylized
landscape; lettering in dark gray. Signed: Hynd. (<em>Spring 1929</em>) <em>Note:</em>
The ML experimented with several pictorial jackets in 1929 in connection
with three boxed sets of three titles each that were intended for sale
as Christmas gifts. The boxed sets, which were sold primarily in
department stores, were <em>Three Great French Romances</em>, <em>Three Great
Renaissance Romances</em>, and <em>Three Great Modern Novels</em>. Hynd’s jackets
for each title in the <em>Three Great Modern Novels</em> gift box—Butler, <em>Way
of All Flesh</em> (13.1d jacket B) and Dostoyevsky, <em>Brothers Karamazov</em>
(171.1a jacket B) in addition to <em>The Return of the Native</em>—were
exceptional examples of expressionist graphics. Their use was confined
to the 1929 gift box and they were never used on copies of the books
sold separately.</p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Kinship with nature and tenderness with human frailty characterize
Thomas Hardy’s brooding and powerful novel, <em>The Return of the
Native</em>. He sets his stage on the heaths and in the villages of his
beloved Wessex and unfolds a drama that becomes the living symbol for
the universal struggle of existence. His characters have the solidity
of the landscape against which they enact their tragic fates, and if
one stands out above the others, she is Eustacia Vye, as memorable a
woman as life or the art of Thomas Hardy could create. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial, probably a smaller version of 126d jacket.
Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1938; probably unsigned. (<em>Not seen</em>)</p>
<p>The Harper plates used for ML printings through 1928 had become badly
worn and Klopfer decided that the ML could not make another printing
from them. He asked Harper’s for their “other set [of plates] so we
can do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper &amp; Bros., 16 May 1929).
Harper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June
(Harper &amp; Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later
that month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.</p>
<p>There are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition
to the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b
include signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates
used for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their
charm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm”
in 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good
morning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after
“good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a
reader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML
informed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.</p>

<p>There were plans in 1950 to include <em>The Return of the Native</em> in MLCE.
Albert Guerard was invited to write the introduction (ML to Guerard, 30
June 1950), but he declined on the grounds that he had just written an
introduction for the competing series Rinehart Editions. The ML then
approached Donald Davidson of Vanderbilt University, who initially
declined because of other commitments. The ML extended the deadline, and
Davidson accepted the assignment. He submitted his introduction in
spring 1951 and received the ML’s $150 fee. However, <em>The Return of the
Native</em> never appeared in MLCE, perhaps because of the competing
Rinehart edition. Davidson’s introduction does not appear to have been
used in any form.</p>

(*Spring 1934*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial, probably a smaller version of 126d jacket.\nDesigned by Paul Galdone, October 1938; probably unsigned. (*Not seen*)\n\nThe Harper plates used for ML printings through 1928 had become badly\nworn and Klopfer decided that the ML could not make another printing\nfrom them. He asked Harper’s for their “other set \\[of plates\\] so we\ncan do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 16 May 1929).\nHarper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June\n(Harper & Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later\nthat month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.\n\nThere are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition\nto the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b\ninclude signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates\nused for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their\ncharm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm”\nin 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good\nmorning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after\n“good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a\nreader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML\ninformed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.\n\n#### 126d.

Designed by Paul\nGaldone; unsigned. Front flap as 126c jacket A. (*Spring 1940*)\n\nThere were plans in 1950 to include *The Return of the Native* in MLCE.\nAlbert Guerard was invited to write the introduction (ML to Guerard, 30\nJune 1950), but he declined on the grounds that he had just written an\nintroduction for the competing series Rinehart Editions. The ML then\napproached Donald Davidson of Vanderbilt University, who initially\ndeclined because of other commitments. The ML extended the deadline, and\nDavidson accepted the assignment. He submitted his introduction in\nspring 1951 and received the ML’s $150 fee. However, *The Return of the\nNative* never appeared in MLCE, perhaps because of the competing\nRinehart edition. Davidson’s introduction does not appear to have been\nused in any form.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nHardy, *Jude the Obscure* (1927–1990) 145<br>\nHardy, *Mayor of Casterbridge* (1917–1971) 17<br>\nHardy, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* (1932–1971; 1979–1986) 234",

(*Spring 1934*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial, probably a smaller version of 126d jacket.\nDesigned by Paul Galdone, October 1938; probably unsigned. (*Not seen*)\n\nThe Harper plates used for ML printings through 1928 had become badly\nworn and Klopfer decided that the ML could not make another printing\nfrom them. He asked Harper’s for their “other set \\[of plates\\] so we\ncan do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 16 May 1929).\nHarper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June\n(Harper & Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later\nthat month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.\n\nThere are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition\nto the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b\ninclude signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates\nused for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their\ncharm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm”\nin 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good\nmorning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after\n“good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a\nreader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML\ninformed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.\n\n"

(*Spring 1940*)\n\nThere were plans in 1950 to include *The Return of the Native* in MLCE.\nAlbert Guerard was invited to write the introduction (ML to Guerard, 30\nJune 1950), but he declined on the grounds that he had just written an\nintroduction for the competing series Rinehart Editions. The ML then\napproached Donald Davidson of Vanderbilt University, who initially\ndeclined because of other commitments. The ML extended the deadline, and\nDavidson accepted the assignment. He submitted his introduction in\nspring 1951 and received the ML’s $150 fee. However, *The Return of the\nNative* never appeared in MLCE, perhaps because of the competing\nRinehart edition. Davidson’s introduction does not appear to have been\nused in any form.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nHardy, *Jude the Obscure* (1927–1990) 145<br>\nHardy, *Mayor of Casterbridge* (1917–1971) 17<br>\nHardy, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* (1932–1971; 1979–1986) 234"
