<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Howard Fast stands foremost among the younger generation of writers in America. His historical novels of the critical first years of the Republic have been notable for their insight and dramatic impact; their heroes are motivated by a deep but simple humanity, and their dedication to man’s struggle for liberty has made his books unique contributions to an understanding of the forces and personalities that shaped our nation. Carl Van Doren says: “Reading <em>The Unvanquished</em> is the next thing to having been on the scene at the time.” (<em>Fall 1945</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1942. ML edition (pp. [<em>7–10</em>], 3–316) printed from Duell, Sloan and Pearce plates with page numerals removed from table of contents and newly drawn maps added on pp. [<em>12–13</em>] to replace the endpaper maps of the original edition. Published fall 1945. <em>WR</em> 3 November 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1952.</p>
<p>Charles Duell suggested a ML edition of Fast’s <em>Conceived in Liberty</em> in 1942. Cerf responded that it wouldn’t have a chance in the ML but that Fast’s recently published novel <em>The Unvanquished</em> would be a different matter (Duell to Cerf, 18 December 1942; Cerf to Duell, 24 December 1942). The reprint contract was signed two-and-a-half years later, in May 1945.</p>
<p>Four years after <em>The Unvanquished</em> was added to the ML, Fast contacted Cerf about a rumor that the novel and his volume devoted to Tom Paine in ML Giants (G69) were being dropped from the series. Fast had joined the Communist Party in 1944 and in recent testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities had refused to reveal the names of contributors to a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War (“Howard Fast,” <em>Wikipedia</em>, accessed 27 July 2010). He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do hope I am needlessly perturbed, but I thought it best to write you and ask whether the rumor that my books have been dropped from the Modern Library has any basis in fact. It came to me from several places in the industry that you were cleaning people like myself out of the Modern Library, and that two of the initial adjustments were THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE.
I don’t have to tell you that I find this most difficult to believe. Whatever our political differences have been—and they have been very considerable—I always considered you a person of independence and integrity. I cannot believe that any circumstances would cause you to give aid and comfort to the unspeakable group of people who both fear and hate books, and attack them. (Fast to Cerf, 7 December 1949).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerf replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rumor you quote in your letter of December 7th to the effect that your books were going to be dropped from the Modern Library because “we were cleaning people like yourself out of the series” is 100% incorrect. I would be interested in learning where you heard this rumor. . . .
Your THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE were added to the Modern Library because we believed they belonged there. Any opinions that we may have of your political ideas, or you personally, do not alter those beliefs in any degree whatsoever. The only thing that will ever make us drop either or both of these books from the series is a drop-off in general sales so marked as to make their retention no longer desirable from a commercial point of view (Cerf to Fast, 9 December 1949).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Unvanquished</em> was dropped from the ML in fall 1952, presumably because of poor sales. <em>The Selected Work of Tom Paine</em>, edited by Fast, coupled with Fast’s novel <em>Citizen Tom Paine</em> (G69), remained in ML Giants until 1970.</p>

Signed: Riki. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Howard Fast stands foremost among the younger generation of writers in America. His historical novels of the critical first years of the Republic have been notable for their insight and dramatic impact; their heroes are motivated by a deep but simple humanity, and their dedication to man’s struggle for liberty has made his books unique contributions to an understanding of the forces and personalities that shaped our nation. Carl Van Doren says: “Reading *The Unvanquished* is the next thing to having been on the scene at the time.” (*Fall 1945*) \n\nOriginally published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1942. ML edition (pp. [*7–10*], 3–316) printed from Duell, Sloan and Pearce plates with page numerals removed from table of contents and newly drawn maps added on pp. [*12–13*] to replace the endpaper maps of the original edition. Published fall 1945. *WR* 3 November 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1952. \n\nCharles Duell suggested a ML edition of Fast’s *Conceived in Liberty* in 1942. Cerf responded that it wouldn’t have a chance in the ML but that Fast’s recently published novel *The Unvanquished* would be a different matter (Duell to Cerf, 18 December 1942; Cerf to Duell, 24 December 1942). The reprint contract was signed two-and-a-half years later, in May 1945. \n\nFour years after *The Unvanquished* was added to the ML, Fast contacted Cerf about a rumor that the novel and his volume devoted to Tom Paine in ML Giants (G69) were being dropped from the series. Fast had joined the Communist Party in 1944 and in recent testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities had refused to reveal the names of contributors to a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War (“Howard Fast,” *Wikipedia*, accessed 27 July 2010). He wrote: \n\n> I do hope I am needlessly perturbed, but I thought it best to write you and ask whether the rumor that my books have been dropped from the Modern Library has any basis in fact. It came to me from several places in the industry that you were cleaning people like myself out of the Modern Library, and that two of the initial adjustments were THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE. \n> I don’t have to tell you that I find this most difficult to believe. Whatever our political differences have been—and they have been very considerable—I always considered you a person of independence and integrity. I cannot believe that any circumstances would cause you to give aid and comfort to the unspeakable group of people who both fear and hate books, and attack them. (Fast to Cerf, 7 December 1949). \n\nCerf replied: \n\n> The rumor you quote in your letter of December 7th to the effect that your books were going to be dropped from the Modern Library because “we were cleaning people like yourself out of the series” is 100% incorrect. I would be interested in learning where you heard this rumor. . . . \n> Your THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE were added to the Modern Library because we believed they belonged there. Any opinions that we may have of your political ideas, or you personally, do not alter those beliefs in any degree whatsoever. The only thing that will ever make us drop either or both of these books from the series is a drop-off in general sales so marked as to make their retention no longer desirable from a commercial point of view (Cerf to Fast, 9 December 1949). \n\n*The Unvanquished* was dropped from the ML in fall 1952, presumably because of poor sales. *The Selected Work of Tom Paine*, edited by Fast, coupled with Fast’s novel *Citizen Tom Paine* (G69), remained in ML Giants until 1970. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nFast, Howard, *Citizen Tom Paine*; *The Selected Work of Tom Paine*, ed.
