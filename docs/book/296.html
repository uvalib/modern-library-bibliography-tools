<p><strong>WILLIAM JAMES. THE VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE. 1936–1969. (ML 70)</strong></p>
<h4><a href='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/revision/296a.html'>296a. First printing (1936)  </a></h4>
<p>[within double rules] THE VARIETIES OF | RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE | <em>A Study in Human Nature</em> | [rule] | BEING THE GIFFORD LECTURES | ON NATURAL RELIGION | DELIVERED AT EDINBURGH IN 1901–1902 | [rule] | BY | WILLIAM JAMES | [rule] | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/A3.webp'>torchbearer A3</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK</p>

<p>[i] half title; [ii] list of books by William James; [iii] title; [iv] <em>Copyright,</em> 1902, <em>by</em> WILLIAM JAMES | [short double rule] | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | 1936; [v] biographical note; [vi] blank; [vii] dedication; [viii] blank; ix–xv CONTENTS; [xvi] blank; xvii–xviii PREFACE dated p. xviii: <span class="smallcaps">Harvard University</span>, | March, 1902.; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–516 text; [517] part title: INDEX; [518] blank; 519–526 INDEX.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in deep orange (51) and black on cream paper with title in black on inset circular panel in deep orange; borders in deep orange, other lettering in black.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> It is both as philosopher and experimental psychologist that William James approached the study of religious phenomena. Conversion, repentance, mysticism, hopes of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter are studied with boldness, sympathy and the unbiased common sense of science. The result is a book that has become a living force in religious literature, for believer and non-believer alike, and has contributed to maintain William James’s status as the greatest American philosopher. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in New York and London by Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1902. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1936. <em>WR</em> 21 November 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The ML paid Longmans, Green an advance of $500. The ML’s reprint rights were limited to the U.S. since Longmans, Green in London retained rights to the Canadian market (Klopfer to Walter Jefferay, Longmans, Green, 26 May 1936). The original royalty rate has not been ascertained but was probably 10 cents a copy. In 1958, shortly before <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em> entered the public domain, Klopfer inquired whether a reduction in royalties would be appropriate (Klopfer to Longmans, Green, 14 February 1958). In 1970 the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em> sold 6,519 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It ranked in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 with sales of 5,390 copies. <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> (119) did not sell as well as <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>. It sold 5,378 copies during the 1942–43 period, placing it near the bottom of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during 1951–52.</p>

Conversion, repentance, mysticism, hopes of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter are studied with boldness, sympathy and the unbiased common sense of science. The result is a book that has become a living force in religious literature, for believer and non-believer alike, and has contributed to maintain William James’s status as the greatest American philosopher.

In 1958, shortly before *The Varieties of Religious Experience* entered the public domain, Klopfer inquired whether a reduction in royalties would be appropriate (Klopfer to Longmans, Green, 14 February 1958). In 1970 the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.  \n\n*The Varieties of Religious Experience* sold 6,519 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.

It sold 5,378 copies during the 1942–43 period, placing it near the bottom of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during 1951–52.  \n\n#### 296b.
