<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Anyone who tries to define the unique genius of James Thurber is bound
to end up in contradictory phrases. Even the
rarely-at-a-loss-for-words <em>London Times</em> concluded a long discussion
of his humor in helpless frustration, saying, “Thurber is Thurber.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best for us to state simply that this is a collection of
some of his best writings and drawings. We believe every reader will
share our opinion that Thurber is - - - well, is Thurber. (<em>Fall
1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harper &amp; Bros., 1945. ML edition (pp. [1]–369)
printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Harper
edition with Thurber’s dedication and foreword omitted, table of
contents partially reset, and the preface on pp. 9–11 updated, re-titled
(from “My Fifty Years with James Thurber”) and reset. The drawing on the
title page is shifted from the half title of the Harper edition.
Published November 1957. <em>WR</em> 2 December 1957. First printing: 15,000
copies.</p>
<p>Cerf had been trying to get <em>The Thurber Carnival</em> since 1946, when he
offered a $6,000 advance to include it in the Giants (Cerf to William
Rose, Jr., Harper &amp; Bros., 24 January 1946). Harper’s finally offered
the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit <em>Reading
for Pleasure</em>, an anthology published by Harper &amp; Bros. in 1957. As Cerf
told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a
long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found
irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD
and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have
been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted”
(Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10
percent of the retail price. <em>Brave New World</em> (485) was published in
the ML in fall 1956.</p>
<p>Bowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D
of the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month
Club using duplicate plates supplied by Harper &amp; Bros. In his list of
variations that distinguish state D (p. 55), however, the nose of the
dog on the fly title (p. [1]) is indicated as absent. The dog’s nose
is present in all ML printings examined.</p>
<p>Thurber’s original preface was titled “My Fifty Years with James
Thurber” and dated “December 6, 1944.” The re-titled preface in the ML
edition, “My Sixty Years with James Thurber,” is identical to the
original version except for changes in the first and next-to-last
paragraphs.</p>
<h4>496b. Reissue format (1979)</h4>
<p>Title as 496a through line 7; line 8: [torchbearer M] THE MODERN
LIBRARY · NEW YORK.</p>
<p>Pagination as 496a. Perfect bound.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial on kraft paper with lettering in very deep
purple (220) and torchbearer in deep brown (56).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
As James Thurber writes in his introduction, “This book contains a
selection of the stories and drawings the old boy did in his prime, a
period which extended roughly from the year Lindbergh flew the
Atlantic to the day coffee was rationed. He presents this to his
readers with his sincere best wishes for a happy new world.”</p>
<p>This anthology draws from such Thurber classics as <em>My World and
Welcome to It</em>, <em>Let Your Mind Alone</em>, <em>The Middle-Aged Man on the
Flying Trapeze</em>, <em>My Life and Hard Times</em>, <em>Fables for Our Time and
Famous Poems Illustrated</em>, <em>The Owl in the Attic</em>, <em>The Seal in the
Bedroom</em>, and <em>Men, Women and Dogs</em>.</p>
