<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Freud’s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious
can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in
the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory,
represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through
them inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to
interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche has
opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in
the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the
world of dreams, Sigmund Freud has created a transformation in our
generation’s thinking. <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> is here offered,
complete and unabridged, in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who
for almost forty years had been the translator and standard-bearer of
Freudian theories in America. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brill translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co.,
1913. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published spring 1950. <em>WR</em> 25 March 1950. First printing: 10,000
copies.</p>
<p>The text follows that of <em>The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud</em> (1938:
G37), where most of the first chapter of <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>
is omitted. The Giant includes the following Editor’s Note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the first chapter of this work is nothing but an introduction to
the book proper, it was deemed best for the purposes of this
collection of Freud’s basic writings to omit most of it and to give
only those parts that are in any way pertinent to the themes under
later consideration. For it is of no particular interest or value to
the general reader to know everything held by the ancients and moderns
concerning the phenomena of dreams, up to the appearance of the first
German edition of this work in 1900. (p. 185)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Editor’s Note is followed by three paragraphs headed, “<em>The author
summarizes these views as follows.</em>” The regular ML edition omits both
the Editor’s Note and this heading. The three summary paragraphs of the
regular ML edition begin in the middle of p. 5 with no indication that
anything has been omitted. In most editions of <em>The Interpretation of
Dreams</em> the first chapter occupies about 95 pages. In the regular ML
text it occupies five pages.</p>
