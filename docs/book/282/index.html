<p>Front flap:<br>
Robinson Jeffers’ position as the writer of the most challenging
poetry of our time is now generally conceded. The spiritual tragedies
that he sets against the rocky landscape of the Pacific coast reveal
all the fierce intensity and overwhelming beauty of his unique gifts.
When <em>Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems</em> was first published a new
and elemental force in our native poetry was acclaimed. Now, in the
Modern Library, it wins new adherents for the poet of the dark
labyrinths of the human soul. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1925. ML edition printed from
newly set plates. Published May 1935. <em>WR</em> 25 May 1935. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued 31 December 1959.</p>
<p>The original B&amp;L plates were too large for the ML’s format and new
plates had to be made for the ML edition. Cerf gave Jeffers an
opportunity to revise the text but he declined. In the introduction he
stated: “. . . it is a pleasure to write, but after a thing has been
written I hate to see it again; poems are the sort of children that it
is delightful to beget, dreary to educate. . . . So I made terms with my
conscience and my publisher: ‘If you’ll let me off revising I’ll write
an introduction instead; that will only take a few hours, the other
would take weeks’” (p. vii). <em>Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems</em> sold
2,403 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it in the bottom quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of
sales.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
For many years Robinson Jeffers has maintained a distinguished place
among the poets of America. When <em>Roan Stallion,</em> <em>Tamar and Other
Poems</em> was first published a new and elemental force in our native
poetry was acclaimed. The fierce tragedies enacted against a
background of the rocky landscape of the Pacific Ocean revealed the
brooding and tortured men and women whose hearts Jeffers searched. In
poem after poem over many years, he has explored the dark labyrinths
of the human spirit. Without compromise or concession he has pursued
his search and written about the stark beauty of a rugged landscape
and the agonized gropings of a people at war with their environment
and themselves. (<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>

ML edition printed from\nnewly set plates. Published May 1935. *WR* 25 May 1935. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 31 December 1959.\n\nThe original B&L plates were too large for the ML’s format and new\nplates had to be made for the ML edition. Cerf gave Jeffers an\nopportunity to revise the text but he declined. In the introduction he\nstated: “. . . it is a pleasure to write, but after a thing has been\nwritten I hate to see it again; poems are the sort of children that it\nis delightful to beget, dreary to educate. . . . So I made terms with my\nconscience and my publisher: ‘If you’ll let me off revising I’ll write\nan introduction instead; that will only take a few hours, the other\nwould take weeks’” (p. vii). *Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems* sold\n2,403 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it in the bottom quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of\nsales.\n\n#### 282b.

Now, in the\n> Modern Library, it wins new adherents for the poet of the dark\n> labyrinths of the human soul. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1925. ML edition printed from\nnewly set plates. Published May 1935. *WR* 25 May 1935. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 31 December 1959.\n\nThe original B&L plates were too large for the ML’s format and new\nplates had to be made for the ML edition. Cerf gave Jeffers an\nopportunity to revise the text but he declined. In the introduction he\nstated: “. . . it is a pleasure to write, but after a thing has been\nwritten I hate to see it again; poems are the sort of children that it\nis delightful to beget, dreary to educate. . . . So I made terms with my\nconscience and my publisher: ‘If you’ll let me off revising I’ll write\nan introduction instead; that will only take a few hours, the other\nwould take weeks’” (p. vii). *Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems* sold\n2,403 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it in the bottom quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of\nsales.\n\n"
