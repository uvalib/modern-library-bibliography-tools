to be found prefaces to “The Revolt of Islam,” “Prometheus Unbound,”
“The Cenci,” and such important essays as “On a Future State,” “On the
Punishment of Death,” “On Metaphysics,” “A Defence of Poetry” and
others. Carlos Baker of Princeton University contributes a penetrating

includes biographical and bibliographical notes. (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
