<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> All the elements for thoroughgoing entertainment can be found in this book. The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land remote geographically and in way of life from the western world. It is peopled with potentates and slave girls, robbers and rogues and—above all—a hero, a resourceful, tongue-in-cheek rascal named Hajji Baba. This adventurer’s ups and (mostly) downs take him through every employment from barber to executioner, into caravans, harems, and camps, and introduce him, and us, to every type of individual in the human comedy. We may suspect, as we pursue our hero from one crisis to another, that James Morier is using these tales to comment on the pride, affectation, hypocrisy and chicanery which are universal in human nature, but Hajji Baba himself asks only a relaxed and sympathetic listener for the varied episodes of his career. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published 1824. ML edition (pp. [xi]–456) printed from plates of the Cresset Press edition (or a duplicate set of the Cresset plates) published in London, 1949, with the introduction by Richard Jennings and the bibliography omitted, Altick’s introduction added, roman page numerals removed from table of contents, alphabetical signatures removed from text pages (except p. 3, where “A.H.B.” [<em>Adventures of Hajji Baba</em>] appears at the left of the bottom margin and the signature “C” appears at the right), and initials “P. P.” removed from p. 456 following the end of the text. Published spring 1954. <em>WR</em> 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1960.</p>
<p>Random House published an edition of <em>The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan</em> with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938 dividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it was printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s format.</p>
<p>Stein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an introduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of $200, but Haight was too busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953). He then approached Altick, offering him $150. He wrote, “What we have in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving largely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth reading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail, but there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a book published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide pleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first appeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his autobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition of James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, <em>The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan</em> . . . which, although it never came near to being one of the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints, earned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one of our daughters” (Altick, <em>A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an Adventurous Scholar,</em> p. 200).</p>
<p>Although Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three printings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and spring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume.</p>
<p>Several months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I have just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an advance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I all change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to Altick, 23 September 1954).</p>

Signed: F.K. [Fritz Kredel] \n\n> Front flap:<br> All the elements for thoroughgoing entertainment can be found in this book. The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land remote geographically and in way of life from the western world. It is peopled with potentates and slave girls, robbers and rogues and—above all—a hero, a resourceful, tongue-in-cheek rascal named Hajji Baba. This adventurer’s ups and (mostly) downs take him through every employment from barber to executioner, into caravans, harems, and camps, and introduce him, and us, to every type of individual in the human comedy. We may suspect, as we pursue our hero from one crisis to another, that James Morier is using these tales to comment on the pride, affectation, hypocrisy and chicanery which are universal in human nature, but Hajji Baba himself asks only a relaxed and sympathetic listener for the varied episodes of his career. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nOriginally published 1824. ML edition (pp. [xi]–456) printed from plates of the Cresset Press edition (or a duplicate set of the Cresset plates) published in London, 1949, with the introduction by Richard Jennings and the bibliography omitted, Altick’s introduction added, roman page numerals removed from table of contents, alphabetical signatures removed from text pages (except p. 3, where “A.H.B.” [*Adventures of Hajji Baba*] appears at the left of the bottom margin and the signature “C” appears at the right), and initials “P. P.” removed from p. 456 following the end of the text. Published spring 1954. *WR* 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1960. \n\nRandom House published an edition of *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938 dividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it was printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s format. \n\nStein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an introduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of \\$200, but Haight was too busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953). He then approached Altick, offering him \\$150. He wrote, “What we have in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving largely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth reading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail, but there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a book published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide pleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first appeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his autobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition of James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* . . . which, although it never came near to being one of the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints, earned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one of our daughters” (Altick, *A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an Adventurous Scholar,* p. 200). \n\nAlthough Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three printings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and spring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume. \n\nSeveral months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I have just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an advance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I all change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to Altick, 23 September 1954). \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n",
