<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
With virtually the entire world at war, Stephen Crane’s masterpiece
becomes even more timely than it ever has been. Its unforgettable
story of the individual soldier in the stress of actual battle has
never been surpassed, and its truth and reality are just as gripping
under the conditions of aerial and tank warfare today as they were
under the circumstances of musket and cavalry charges of the Civil
War. <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> is a notable addition to the Modern
Library series because of all war books it remains through the years
one of the most permanent. (<em>Spring 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1895. New bibliographical
edition published by Appleton, 1925, with essay on Crane by Max J.
Herzberg**.** ML edition (pp. v–[267]) printed from Appleton-Century
plates. Published February 1942. <em>WR</em> 14 February 1942. First printing:
Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf tried to secure reprint rights to <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> as
early as 1928, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10
cents a copy (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton &amp; Co., 12 December
1928), but Appleton refused to grant permission. The copyright status of
the novel was unclear. Alfred A. Knopf had included it in a 12-volume
limited edition of Crane’s works published in 1925. In the early 1930s,
when Knopf was considering including it in an omnibus edition of Crane’s
works, his lawyers concluded that it was in the public domain. Cerf told
Knopf that he planned to offer Appleton a $600 advance against royalties
of 6 cents a copy and would probably publish it in the ML without
permission if Appleton rejected the offer (Cerf to Knopf, 2 December
1932). Neither Knopf nor Cerf went ahead with their plans**.** When the
ML published <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> ten years later it was by
arrangement with Appleton-Century and printed from Appleton plates. The
ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 5,660 copies during the 18-month period May
1942‑October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML titles.
The release of John Huston’s film version in 1951 appears to have
boosted sales. The ML edition sold 7,418 copies between November 1951
and October 1952, making <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> the19th best-selling
title in the series.</p>

<p><em>Jacket A</em> with first sentence of flap text revised: “With virtually the
entire world constantly threatened with war. . . .” (<em>Fall 1955</em>)</p>
<p>Published in MLCE January 1951 and in the regular ML by March 1952.</p>
<p>Stallman received $200 for his introduction and editorial work on the
volume (Stein to Stallman, 26 June 1950). Stein, who edited Modern
Library College Editions, wanted to add several stories by Crane to the
volume, in part because he thought it might forestall Rinehart &amp; Co.
from bringing out a competing edition in their paperback series for the
college market (Stein to Stallman, 11 July 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 28
August 1950). Stallman suggested “Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,” “The
Open Boat,” “An Episode of War,” “The Upturned Face,” and “A Mystery of
Heroism.” Stein hoped to secure permission to include the stories for a
flat fee, but Knopf insisted on a royalty. Appleton-Century-Crofts was
charging a 2-cent royalty for the use of their plates for MLCE
printings. Adding the stories would have increased the royalty for MLCE
printings to 4 cents a copy and also added to the cost of the regular ML
edition. Haas indicated that this was too much, and plans to include the
stories were abandoned (Haas to Stein, 30 August 1950).</p>

moderate orange (53), and yellowish gray (93) on coated white paper with
inset reproduction of 1862 recruiting poster in yellowish gray touched

other lettering in moderate orange, all against black background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Stephen Crane wrote about war with all the compassion and poetry of a
great artist. He was the first American writer to depict the horrors
of war, the ambiguities of courage, and the absence of heroic
illusions among soldiers. In addition, <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> is a
brilliantly structured work that illuminates the nature of the
artistic imagination: Stephen Crane did not experience the war first
hand, but through the powers of empathy and projection he has given us
an unparalleled and unforgettable picture of the Civil War stripped of
romantic glorification.</p>

Unsigned.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> With virtually the entire world at war, Stephen Crane’s masterpiece\n> becomes even more timely than it ever has been. Its unforgettable\n> story of the individual soldier in the stress of actual battle has\n> never been surpassed, and its truth and reality are just as gripping\n> under the conditions of aerial and tank warfare today as they were\n> under the circumstances of musket and cavalry charges of the Civil\n> War. *The Red Badge of Courage* is a notable addition to the Modern\n> Library series because of all war books it remains through the years\n> one of the most permanent. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by D. Appleton & Co., 1895. New bibliographical\nedition published by Appleton, 1925, with essay on Crane by Max J.\nHerzberg**.** ML edition (pp. v–\\[267\\]) printed from Appleton-Century\nplates. Published February 1942. *WR* 14 February 1942. First printing:\nNot ascertained.\n\nCerf tried to secure reprint rights to *The Red Badge of Courage* as\nearly as 1928, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December\n1928), but Appleton refused to grant permission. The copyright status of\nthe novel was unclear. Alfred A. Knopf had included it in a 12-volume\nlimited edition of Crane’s works published in 1925. In the early 1930s,\nwhen Knopf was considering including it in an omnibus edition of Crane’s\nworks, his lawyers concluded that it was in the public domain. Cerf told\nKnopf that he planned to offer Appleton a $600 advance against royalties\nof 6 cents a copy and would probably publish it in the ML without\npermission if Appleton rejected the offer (Cerf to Knopf, 2 December\n1932). Neither Knopf nor Cerf went ahead with their plans**.** When the\nML published *The Red Badge of Courage* ten years later it was by\narrangement with Appleton-Century and printed from Appleton plates. The\nML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy.\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,660 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942‑October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML titles.\nThe release of John Huston’s film version in 1951 appears to have\nboosted sales. The ML edition sold 7,418 copies between November 1951\nand October 1952, making *The Red Badge of Courage* the19th best-selling\ntitle in the series.\n\n#### 347.1b.

Stein, who edited Modern\nLibrary College Editions, wanted to add several stories by Crane to the\nvolume, in part because he thought it might forestall Rinehart & Co.\nfrom bringing out a competing edition in their paperback series for the\ncollege market (Stein to Stallman, 11 July 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 28\nAugust 1950). Stallman suggested “Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,” “The\nOpen Boat,” “An Episode of War,” “The Upturned Face,” and “A Mystery of\nHeroism.” Stein hoped to secure permission to include the stories for a\nflat fee, but Knopf insisted on a royalty. Appleton-Century-Crofts was\ncharging a 2-cent royalty for the use of their plates for MLCE\nprintings. Adding the stories would have increased the royalty for MLCE\nprintings to 4 cents a copy and also added to the cost of the regular ML\nedition. Haas indicated that this was too much, and plans to include the\nstories were abandoned (Haas to Stein, 30 August 1950).\n\n#### 347.1c.

In addition, *The Red Badge of Courage* is a\n> brilliantly structured work that illuminates the nature of the\n> artistic imagination: Stephen Crane did not experience the war first\n> hand, but through the powers of empathy and projection he has given us\n> an unparalleled and unforgettable picture of the Civil War stripped of\n> romantic glorification.",
