<p>Text on front:<br>
‘WUTHERING HEIGHTS’ was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools,
out of homely materials. The statuary found a granite block on a
solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be
elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least
one element of grandeur—power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from
no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the
crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and
frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and
goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of
mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its
blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the
giant’s foot. CHARLOTTE BRONTË</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from duplicate plates of the edition published in
1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. Published January 1926.
<em>WR</em> 6 February 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1969/70. Reissued 1978.</p>
<p>Macaulay had agreed to write an introduction to <em>Wuthering Heights</em> when
the ML was published by B&amp;L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925
(B&amp;L advertisement, <em>PW</em>, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction
failed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just
bought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited
England in June but was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he
wrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a
short introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s
“Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I
would therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction
within a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than
four or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of
$50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6
August 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After
thanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your
own books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an
ideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September
1925).</p>
<p>A slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included
in the British edition of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> published in 1926 in
Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first
paragraph of the introduction concludes with the following three
sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about
these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that
every available fact about their personalities and lives is now
familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at
all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the
poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to
his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired,
never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed
the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put
some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the
words, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives
is now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts
at all.”</p>
<p>Except for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are
printed from identical plates. The only difference is that the
Travellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the
first page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other
Travellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a
duplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement
may have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.</p>
<p>The title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay
(“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.</p>
<p>Blue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay
introduction, for a 1939 printing of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> in its new
reprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and
sold for 39 cents a copy.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed
it 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter
during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably
reflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion
of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> as one of the first titles in Modern Library
College Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for
classroom use.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Emily Brontë’s brooding imagination evoked as thwarted and tragic a
group of human creatures as ever walked the bleak moorlands or had
their existence in the dark byways of life. The barren world in which
their villanies [<em>sic</em>] flourished forms the background for deeds as
weird as they are sinister and for passions as fierce as they are
persistent. <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is by common consent one of the most
compelling novels in the English language. It is a book compact of
beauty and loveliness, hate and cruelty and heartrending pathos.
(<em>Fall 1933</em>) <em>Note:</em> The misspelling of “villainies” is retained on
jacket flaps at least through fall 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Though <em>Wuthering Heights</em> was written by a woman who remained a
recluse all of her life, it is one of the most powerful and passionate
novels in the English language. The romantic story of the destruction
caused by the frustrated love of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff,
set against the moors of England, creates a rare blend of violence and
beauty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular
ML. ML edition (pp. xxvii‑xxxii, [1]–400) printed from plates
originally made for the Illustrated Modern Library with pagination of
the Editor’s Preface revised. In ML and MLCE printings Charlotte
Brontë’s Biographical Notice is reset in smaller type to match that of
Gettman’s introduction. ML and MLCE printings include Eichenberg’s
wood-engraved chapter heads that were made for the Book-of-the-Month
Club and the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 18) but not the full-page
wood engravings.</p>
<p>The Illustrated Modern Library edition of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (IML 18),
published in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition of <em>Wuthering
Heights</em> had a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only.
For the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional
wood engravings for the chapter heads. Since <em>Wuthering Heights</em>
consists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice
and one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.</p>
<p>New plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for
subsequent printings of the regular ML edition. This appears to have
been the intention, since the preliminaries for the regular ML edition
of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, including Macaulay’s introduction, were reset to
match the rest of the text. However, the original plates were used when
the regular ML edition of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (120.1c) was reprinted in
fall 1947. No regular ML printings with the reset text have been seen
prior to 120.2a, when the Illustrated Modern Library plates were used
with a new introduction by Royal A. Gettmann.</p>
<p>Gettmann received $150 for his introduction (Stein to Gettmann, 24
January 1950).</p>

CHARLOTTE BRONTË\n\nML edition printed from duplicate plates of the edition published in\n1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. Published January 1926.\n*WR* 6 February 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1969/70. Reissued 1978.\n\nMacaulay had agreed to write an introduction to *Wuthering Heights* when\nthe ML was published by B&L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925\n(B&L advertisement, *PW*, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction\nfailed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just\nbought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited\nEngland in June but was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he\nwrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a\nshort introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s\n“Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I\nwould therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction\nwithin a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than\nfour or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of\n$50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6\nAugust 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After\nthanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your\nown books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an\nideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September\n1925).\n\nA slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included\nin the British edition of *Wuthering Heights* published in 1926 in\nJonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first\nparagraph of the introduction concludes with the following three\nsentences:\n\n> There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about\n> these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that\n> every available fact about their personalities and lives is now\n> familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at\n> all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the\n> poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to\n> his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired,\n> never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed\n> the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put\n> some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.\n\nIn the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the\nwords, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives\nis now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts\nat all.”\n\nExcept for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are\nprinted from identical plates. The only difference is that the\nTravellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the\nfirst page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other\nTravellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a\nduplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement\nmay have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.\n\nThe title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay\n(“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.\n\nBlue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay\nintroduction, for a 1939 printing of *Wuthering Heights* in its new\nreprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and\nsold for 39 cents a copy.\n\nSales of *Wuthering Heights* during the first six months of 1928 placed\nit 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter\nduring the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably\nreflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion\nof *Wuthering Heights* as one of the first titles in Modern Library\nCollege Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for\nclassroom use.\n\n#### 120.1b.

(*Fall 1952*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita pictorial jacket in black, deep purplish red (256)\nand brilliant yellow (83) on coated white paper with silhouette of\nbarren tree and birds in reverse and lettering in deep purplish red,\nbrilliant yellow and in reverse, all against black background.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Though *Wuthering Heights* was written by a woman who remained a\n> recluse all of her life, it is one of the most powerful and passionate\n> novels in the English language. The romantic story of the destruction\n> caused by the frustrated love of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff,\n> set against the moors of England, creates a rare blend of violence and\n> beauty.\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular\nML. ML edition (pp. xxvii‑xxxii, \\[1\\]–400) printed from plates\noriginally made for the Illustrated Modern Library with pagination of\nthe Editor’s Preface revised. In ML and MLCE printings Charlotte\nBrontë’s Biographical Notice is reset in smaller type to match that of\nGettman’s introduction. ML and MLCE printings include Eichenberg’s\nwood-engraved chapter heads that were made for the Book-of-the-Month\nClub and the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 18) but not the full-page\nwood engravings.\n\nThe Illustrated Modern Library edition of *Wuthering Heights* (IML 18),\npublished in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition of *Wuthering\nHeights* had a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only.\nFor the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional\nwood engravings for the chapter heads. Since *Wuthering Heights*\nconsists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice\nand one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.\n\nNew plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for\nsubsequent printings of the regular ML edition. This appears to have\nbeen the intention, since the preliminaries for the regular ML edition\nof *Wuthering Heights*, including Macaulay’s introduction, were reset to\nmatch the rest of the text. However, the original plates were used when\nthe regular ML edition of *Wuthering Heights* (120.1c) was reprinted in\nfall 1947. No regular ML printings with the reset text have been seen\nprior to 120.2a, when the Illustrated Modern Library plates were used\nwith a new introduction by Royal A. Gettmann.\n\nGettmann received $150 for his introduction (Stein to Gettmann, 24\nJanuary 1950).\n\n#### 120.2b.
