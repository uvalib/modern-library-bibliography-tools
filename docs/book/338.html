<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in dark red (16) and black on light grayish
yellowish brown paper (79) with illustration in dark red of an American
eagle with arrows and olive branch perched on a shield; lettering in
black. Text on front: THE | <em>Federalist</em> | THE EIGHTY-FIVE ESSAYS
WRITTEN BY | <em>Alexander Hamilton</em> · <em>John Jay</em> · <em>James Madison</em> | WHICH
PERSUADED THE FOUNDING | FATHERS TO ADOPT THE CONSTITUTION | OF THE
UNITED STATES.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For every American who is eager to know the fundamental principles
upon which the Government of the United States was established, the
first source is <em>The Federalist</em>. These essays by Hamilton, Jay and
Madison provided the arguments which persuaded the Founding Fathers to
adopt the Constitution. They are required reading for an understanding
of the ideal of representative government, now facing its most
critical challenge in the one hundred and fifty years of America’s
independence. By giving <em>The Federalist</em> the widest possible
distribution at a cost within everybody’s purse, the Modern Library
helps to explain the origins of our government to our people. (<em>Spring
1941</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sesquicentennial Edition published by National Home Library Foundation,
1938. ML edition (pp. v–618) printed from National Home Library
Foundation plates. Published January 1941. <em>WR</em> 25 January 1941. First
printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The ML presented the National Home Library Foundation with a complete
set of ML books in print in exchange for the free use of its plates. The
first printing of the ML edition failed to acknowledge the Foundation.
It included instead the following statement, adapted from the National
Home Library Foundation edition: “Acknowledgment is made, with thanks,
for the aid received from the <em>Carnegie Corporation of New York</em> in
making possible this edition of <em>The Federalist</em>” (p. [iv]). The ML
removed the title leaf of remaining copies of the first printing and
tipped in a new title leaf which acknowledged the National Home Library
Foundation on the verso (338a<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,782 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,
placing it low in the first quarter of ML titles. It sold 4,330 copies
during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, retaining its
place in the first quarter of ML titles.</p>

<p>Contents as 338a<sub>1</sub> except pp. [iii–iv] removed and replaced
by a newly printed sheet with the verso of the title page revised as
follows: [iv] FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION | 1941 | The publishers are
indebted to the National Home | Library Foundation for making this
edition possible | and wish to thank them for the courtesy extended in |
the use of their plates. | [4-line dedication] <em>Note:</em> The second leaf
(pp. [iii–iv]) with the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation of
New York (338a<sub>1</sub>) was removed from all copies in stock and
replaced with a newly printed leaf with the acknowledgement to the
National Home Library Foundation.</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> As 338a<sub>1</sub>. <em>Note:</em> Some later printings on light
bluish gray (191) paper. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>
<p>Sherman F. Mittell of the National Home Library Foundation informed
Klopfer shortly after publication that the ML should have thanked the
Foundation and that the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation
would have to be removed. Klopfer agreed to rip the title leaf out of
every copy in stock and tip in a corrected leaf with the acknowledgment,
“The publishers are indebted to the National Home Library Foundation for
making this edition possible and wish to thank them for the courtesy
extended in the use of their plates” (Klopfer to Mittell, 27 February
1941; Mittell to Klopfer, 4 March 1941). A sizable portion of the first
printing appears to have been distributed before the cancellation and
replacement of the title leaf. Copies of 338a<sub>2</sub> are notably
harder to find than copies of 338a<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>After Mittell’s death in 1942 his widow offered to sell the National
Home Library Foundation plates to the ML. Cerf offered $250, then raised
his offer to $350 (Cerf to Fanny Mittell, 10 August 1942). The offer
appears to have been accepted. In 1960 Jason Epstein reported that the
ML paid no royalty and owned the plates free and clear but still showed
practically no profit per copy (Epstein to Willard A. Lockwood, 24 May
1960).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The printing for the National Foundation for Education in American
Citizenship was undertaken as a commission and was not a ML publication.
The publication statement on the verso of the title page identifying
Random House as the publisher of the Modern Library is omitted, as is
the manufacturing statement. The only references to the Modern Library
appear on the spine of the binding and the backstrip of the jacket. The
ML’s regular binding and endpapers are used.</p>

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe ML presented the National Home Library Foundation with a complete\nset of ML books in print in exchange for the free use of its plates. The\nfirst printing of the ML edition failed to acknowledge the Foundation.\nIt included instead the following statement, adapted from the National\nHome Library Foundation edition: “Acknowledgment is made, with thanks,\nfor the aid received from the *Carnegie Corporation of New York* in\nmaking possible this edition of *The Federalist*” (p. \\[iv\\]). The ML\nremoved the title leaf of remaining copies of the first printing and\ntipped in a new title leaf which acknowledged the National Home Library\nFoundation on the verso (338a<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,782 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing it low in the first quarter of ML titles. It sold 4,330 copies\nduring the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, retaining its\nplace in the first quarter of ML titles.\n\n**338a<sub>2</sub>.

(*Fall 1946*)\n\nSherman F. Mittell of the National Home Library Foundation informed\nKlopfer shortly after publication that the ML should have thanked the\nFoundation and that the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation\nwould have to be removed. Klopfer agreed to rip the title leaf out of\nevery copy in stock and tip in a corrected leaf with the acknowledgment,\n“The publishers are indebted to the National Home Library Foundation for\nmaking this edition possible and wish to thank them for the courtesy\nextended in the use of their plates” (Klopfer to Mittell, 27 February\n1941; Mittell to Klopfer, 4 March 1941). A sizable portion of the first\nprinting appears to have been distributed before the cancellation and\nreplacement of the title leaf. Copies of 338a<sub>2</sub> are notably\nharder to find than copies of 338a<sub>1</sub>.\n\nAfter Mittell’s death in 1942 his widow offered to sell the National\nHome Library Foundation plates to the ML. Cerf offered $250, then raised\nhis offer to $350 (Cerf to Fanny Mittell, 10 August 1942). The offer\nappears to have been accepted. In 1960 Jason Epstein reported that the\nML paid no royalty and owned the plates free and clear but still showed\npractically no profit per copy (Epstein to Willard A. Lockwood, 24 May\n1960).\n\n#### 338b.
