love. | Love for an object external and infinite feeds the mind | with

<p><em>Variant:</em> Pagination as 136a. [1–14]<sup>16</sup>. Contents as 136a

Spinoza in italic type, signed (on the fifth line) <span
class="smallcaps">Spinoza.</span>]. <em>Note:</em> The other epigraphs are
also reset in italic type with the single-rule frame omitted.
(<em>Imitation leather binding; probably the second printing</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Format:</em> The first printing is in the standard 6½ by 4¼ inch format
with very narrow margins at the top and foot. Several later printings of
136a are about ¼ inch taller and wider than the standard format. Narrow
margins were sometimes unavoidable when the ML printed from other
publishers’ plates, but it was unusual for a typesetting designed for
the ML to have such narrow margins. It is possible that the size of the
type page was determined by an economic decision to limit the volume to
fourteen gatherings of sixteen leaves each.</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Mr. Ratner remarks that “after having been one of the liberating
thinkers of mankind who was read but not honored, Spinoza is fast
becoming one of the canonized of mankind who are honored but not
read.” This volume with its Life, Introduction, and Selections will
immensely assist to get Spinoza read and understood as well as
honored. If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I
should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding
the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities;
and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their
kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of
our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the
extracts from Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> between selections from his more
popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and
his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech,
etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s
thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be
disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence
in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling
him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the
light and leading which he can give.” —<span class="smallcaps">John
Dewey</span>. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial philosophy jacket in moderate blue (182) and brown
on tan paper depicting a helmeted woman holding a scroll and lamp;
borders in moderate blue, lettering in brown. Signed: WC. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Professor Ratner’s masterly arrangement of Spinoza’s philosophy has
become the standard text in leading universities throughout the
country. John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s
volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the
professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious
companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can
give.” (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published February 1927. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1927.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Ratner was born in 1901 and received his M.A. from Columbia University
in 1923. He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy
department at Columbia when he compiled <em>The Philosophy of Spinoza</em>. He
received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.</p>
<p>Cerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on
Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on
Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract
on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I
believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the
excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6
October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza
continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7
June 1927).</p>
<p>In April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,
Ratner sold his rights to <em>The Philosophy of Spinoza</em> and John Dewey’s
<em>Intelligence in the Modern World</em> (G41) for $500. He also retained the
unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the
previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.
The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner
received no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the
contracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus
royalties accrued from 1 January 1940.</p>

<p>That saintly and exalted philosopher, Baruch de Spinoza, wrote and
lived as a man of reason and a champion of the freedom of thought and
speech. For three centuries his writings have been one of the great
glories of the human spirit. The selections in this volume offer the
essence of Spinoza’s contribution to philosophy as derived from
<em>Tractatus Theologica-Politicus</em>, <em>Improvement of the Understanding</em>
and <em>Ethics</em>. John Dewey wrote of this book: “I shall be disappointed

He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy\ndepartment at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He\nreceived his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.\n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on\nRatner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on\nBiblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract\non Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I\nbelieve the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the\nexcessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6\nOctober 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza\ncontinues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7\nJune 1927).\n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,\nRatner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s\n*Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for $500. He also retained the\nunearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the\nprevious year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.\nThe two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner\nreceived no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the\ncontracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus\nroyalties accrued from 1 January 1940.\n\n#### 136b.

Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on\nBiblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract\non Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I\nbelieve the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the\nexcessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6\nOctober 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza\ncontinues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7\nJune 1927).\n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,\nRatner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s\n*Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for $500. He also retained the\nunearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the\nprevious year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.\nThe two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner\nreceived no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the\ncontracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus\nroyalties accrued from 1 January 1940.\n\n"
