<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>The Great Gatsby</em> is a story of the fabulous 1920s, that incredible
period in American history that ended in a crash from which we are all
reeling still. The editors of <em>Time</em> Magazine report that Gatsby was
the “first racketeer in United States fiction.” Countless novels and
motion pictures have followed the pattern since, but <em>The Great
Gatsby</em> remains the most brilliant and understanding portrait of the
first mad days of the bootleg era. It is by all odds Scott
Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the
development of American literature can afford to overlook. (<em>Fall
1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp.
[xiii]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.
<em>WR</em> 29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.
Discontinued 1 January 1939.</p>
<p>Maxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML
edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to
announce the forthcoming publication of <em>Tender Is the Night</em>, which
appeared initially as a serial in <em>Scribner’s Magazine</em>, and added: “If
it goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why
don’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by
Gertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and
wrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it
had brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was
“creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see
Tanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted
to publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against
royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald
$50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934).
Including his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300
from the ML edition.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our
series” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf
about the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off
writing it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of
the approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week.
He appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs
of the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the
corrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the
introduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).</p>
<p>The ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original
introductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni &amp; Liveright
era, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction to <em>South
Wind</em> (114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition of <em>Mrs.
Dalloway</em> (168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of
this genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> was one of
the worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future
printings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like
the preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and
incoherance [<em>sic</em>], two qualities which the story that succeeds it
manages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to
reassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to
Fitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared,
“The preface <em>is</em> incoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but
simply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).</p>
<p>A 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is
inscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in
Tryon [North Carolina]” with the additional annotation at the top of
p. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington,
London; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the
ML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of
Maxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s
own hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv
&lt;modlib@thuban.owu.edu&gt;, 10 November 2011).</p>
<p><em>Tender Is the Night</em>, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published
in April 1934, five months before the ML edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.
By 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent
Cerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition of <em>Tender Is
the Night</em> if he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now
are essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the
correspondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the
preceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he
wrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity
. . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than
one in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads
them to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to
Cerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell
Perkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishing <em>This Side of Paradise,</em>
<em>The Great Gatsby</em>, and <em>Tender Is the Night</em> as an omnibus volume in
the ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli, <em>Some Sort of Epic
Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald</em>, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> were disappointing. The ML edition sold
about 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral
History, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal
enthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest
sellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott
Fitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s,
31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By
the early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> was
selling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).</p>
<p>There was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 after <em>The Great
Gatsby</em> was discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are
stamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as
remainders.</p>

It is by all odds Scott\n> Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the\n> development of American literature can afford to overlook. (*Fall\n> 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xiii\\]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.\n*WR* 29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nMaxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to\nannounce the forthcoming publication of *Tender Is the Night*, which\nappeared initially as a serial in *Scribner’s Magazine*, and added: “If\nit goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why\ndon’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by\nGertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter of *The Great Gatsby* and\nwrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it\nhad brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was\n“creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see\nTanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted\nto publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald\n$50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934).\nIncluding his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300\nfrom the ML edition.\n\nFitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our\nseries” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf\nabout the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off\nwriting it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of\nthe approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week.\nHe appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs\nof the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the\ncorrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the\nintroduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).\n\nThe ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original\nintroductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni & Liveright\nera, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction to *South\nWind* (114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition of *Mrs.\nDalloway* (168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of\nthis genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction to *The Great Gatsby* was one of\nthe worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future\nprintings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like\nthe preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and\nincoherance \\[*sic*\\], two qualities which the story that succeeds it\nmanages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to\nreassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to\nFitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared,\n“The preface *is* incoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but\nsimply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).\n\nA 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is\ninscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in\nTryon \\[North Carolina\\]” with the additional annotation at the top of\np. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington,\nLondon; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the\nML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of\nMaxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s\nown hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv\n&lt;modlib@thuban.owu.edu&gt;, 10 November 2011).\n\n*Tender Is the Night*, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published\nin April 1934, five months before the ML edition of *The Great Gatsby*.\nBy 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent\nCerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition of *Tender Is\nthe Night* if he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now\nare essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the\ncorrespondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the\npreceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he\nwrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity\n. . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than\none in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads\nthem to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to\nCerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell\nPerkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishing *This Side of Paradise,*\n*The Great Gatsby*, and *Tender Is the Night* as an omnibus volume in\nthe ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli, *Some Sort of Epic\nGrandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald*, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).\n\nSales of *The Great Gatsby* were disappointing. The ML edition sold\nabout 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral\nHistory, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal\nenthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest\nsellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott\nFitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s,\n31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By\nthe early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition of *The Great Gatsby* was\nselling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).\n\nThere was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 after *The Great\nGatsby* was discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are\nstamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as\nremainders.\n\n.",
