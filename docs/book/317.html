<p><em>Format:</em> 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and balloon
cloth binding D.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial on coated white paper with color reproduction of Van
Gogh’s self-portrait dedicated to Paul Gauguin, painted at Arles in
1888, lettering in brilliant yellow (83) and reverse on black upper
panel; backstrip in brilliant yellow with lettering in black.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The turbulent life of Vincent Van Gogh is the basis for Irving Stone’s
best-selling novel. Out of the misery of the painter’s struggle for
existence and the magnificence he achieved in his art, there is woven
his profoundly moving life-story. Van Gogh worked, fought and created
with some of the most celebrated men of the century: Gauguin, Zola,
Cezanne; and he lived with some of the most abject human beings of his
time. In the pages of <em>Lust for Life</em>, Van Gogh is vindicated as man
and artist. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1934. ML edition (pp.
[v]–489) printed from Longmans, Green plates. Published February 1939.
<em>WR</em> 18 February 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1970/71.</p>
<p>The Longmans, Green plates were too large for the ML’s 6½ by 4¼ inch
format. To avoid resetting the text the ML the published <em>Lust for Life</em>
in the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would become standard for ML books
beginning in fall 1939.</p>
<p>Lewis Miller, the RH sales manager, liked the larger format. He
considered <em>Lust for Life</em> the most presentable book the ML had
published, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT
SHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also
regarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and
appearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did
not have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar
reprint published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8
February 1939).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1
November 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It
sold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952,
placing it high in the second quarter of ML titles. Adjusted for 18
months, 1951–52 sales exceed those for 1942–43 by fewer than 100 copies;
the ranking of <em>Lust for Life</em> in the third quarter of ML sales during
1942–43 reflects the increase in demand for books of all kinds during
the Second World War.</p>
<p>Pocket Books, Inc., published <em>Lust for Life</em> as a 25-cent paperback in
1945. The film version of Stone’s novel starring Kirk Douglas, released
in 1956, probably led to an increase in sales of the ML edition, but
sales figures for the mid-1950s are not available.</p>

Out of the misery of the painter’s struggle for\n> existence and the magnificence he achieved in his art, there is woven\n> his profoundly moving life-story. Van Gogh worked, fought and created\n> with some of the most celebrated men of the century: Gauguin, Zola,\n> Cezanne; and he lived with some of the most abject human beings of his\n> time. In the pages of *Lust for Life*, Van Gogh is vindicated as man\n> and artist. (*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Longmans, Green & Co., 1934. ML edition (pp.\n\\[v\\]–489) printed from Longmans, Green plates. Published February 1939.\n*WR* 18 February 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1970/71.\n\nThe Longmans, Green plates were too large for the ML’s 6½ by 4¼ inch\nformat. To avoid resetting the text the ML the published *Lust for Life*\nin the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would become standard for ML books\nbeginning in fall 1939.\n\nLewis Miller, the RH sales manager, liked the larger format. He\nconsidered *Lust for Life* the most presentable book the ML had\npublished, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT\nSHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also\nregarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and\nappearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did\nnot have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar\nreprint published by Grosset & Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8\nFebruary 1939).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It\nsold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it high in the second quarter of ML titles. Adjusted for 18\nmonths, 1951–52 sales exceed those for 1942–43 by fewer than 100 copies;\nthe ranking of *Lust for Life* in the third quarter of ML sales during\n1942–43 reflects the increase in demand for books of all kinds during\nthe Second World War.\n\nPocket Books, Inc., published *Lust for Life* as a 25-cent paperback in\n1945.

Out of the misery of the painter’s struggle for\n> existence and the magnificence he achieved in his art, there is woven\n> his profoundly moving life-story. Van Gogh worked, fought and created\n> with some of the most celebrated men of the century: Gauguin, Zola,\n> Cezanne; and he lived with some of the most abject human beings of his\n> time. In the pages of *Lust for Life*, Van Gogh is vindicated as man\n> and artist. (*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Longmans, Green & Co., 1934. ML edition (pp.\n\\[v\\]–489) printed from Longmans, Green plates. Published February 1939.\n*WR* 18 February 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1970/71.\n\nThe Longmans, Green plates were too large for the ML’s 6½ by 4¼ inch\nformat. To avoid resetting the text the ML the published *Lust for Life*\nin the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would become standard for ML books\nbeginning in fall 1939.\n\nLewis Miller, the RH sales manager, liked the larger format. He\nconsidered *Lust for Life* the most presentable book the ML had\npublished, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT\nSHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also\nregarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and\nappearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did\nnot have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar\nreprint published by Grosset & Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8\nFebruary 1939).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It\nsold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it high in the second quarter of ML titles.
