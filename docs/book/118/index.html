[1] part title: H.M.S. PINAFORE | <em>or, The Lass That Loved a Sailor;</em>
[2] DRAMATIS PERSONÆ; 3–218 text; [219–220] blank.</p>
<p><em>Contents:</em> H.M.S. Pinafore – Patience – The Yeomen of the Guard –
Ruddigore.</p>
<p><em>Jacket 1a:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B1 with “GILBERT GABRIEL”
(without middle initial) listed as the author of the introduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>If the band of genial and optimistic dramatic critics who have been
hailing every twenty-two year old lyricist who negotiates a rhyme with
more than one syllable in it as “another Gilbert come to town” ever
sees this volume, they’ll simply lock themselves in their room! For a
rereading of PINAFORE, PATIENCE, THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD and
RUDDIGORE, all of them contained in this one volume, will convince
them anew that there is only one Gilbert, and that, futhermore
[<em>sic</em>], his myriad of imitators fade into utter nothingness beside
the brilliance and undying sparkle of his famous songs and ballads.</p>
<p>Another Modern Library volume (number 26) contains THE MIKADO, THE
PIRATES OF PENZANCE, IOLANTHE, and THE GONDOLIERS. The two volumes
belong in the library of every dramatic critic, musical comedy author,
and tired business man in America. (<em>Fall 1925</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published 25 November 1925. <em>WR</em> 19 December
1925. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1938,
nearly two years after <em>The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan</em>
(G23) was published as a ML Giant.</p>
<p>Gabriel complained that his middle initial had been omitted from the
title page and jacket and was assured that it would be included in
future printings.</p>
<p><em>H.M.S. Pinafore and Other Plays</em> is not listed among the ML’s 99
best-selling titles during the first six months of 1928; Gilbert’s <em>The
Mikado and Other Plays</em> (29) ranked fifty-sixth.</p>
<h4>118b. Title page reset (1925)</h4>
<p>Title page completely reset; transcription as 118a except line 6:
INTRODUCTION BY GILBERT W. GABRIEL</p>
<p>Pp. [i–vi] vii–xvi, [1–2] 3–218 [219–224]. [1–7]<sup>16</sup>
[8]<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Contents as 118a except: [ii] pub. note A4; [219–224] ML list.
(<em>Fall 1925</em>) <em>Note:</em> The copyright and <em>First</em> statements are retained
on p. [iv] of the first printing of 118b; printings examined with 1927
and later lists have only the manufacturing statement on p. [iv].</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B1 with “GILBERT W. GABRIEL”
(including middle initial) listed as the author of the introduction.
Text on front as 118a, including the misspelling “futhermore” (<em>Spring
1927</em>) <em>Note:</em> There may have been an earlier printing of the jacket
with Gabriel’s middle initial.</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan enthusiast (and who is not?), here,
for your constant delight, are four W. S. Gilbert librettos—those
merry, spoofing plays to which you have sung and whistled Sir Arthur
Sullivan’s inspired tunes. All the sprightliness, the gay satire and
the felicity of rhyme are yours for the reading! This is one of the
two volumes of W. S. Gilbert’s plays in the Modern Library; the other
(No. 26) contains <em>The Mikado</em>, <em>The Gondoliers</em>, <em>The Pirates of
Penzance</em> and <em>Iolanthe</em>. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a spring 1939 printing of jacket 2 after <em>H.M.S. Pinafore and
Other Plays</em> was discontinued. The spring 1939 jackets were stamped
“DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used on copies sold as remainders.</p>
