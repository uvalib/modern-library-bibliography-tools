<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>The only quarrel among Trollope enthusiasts revolves around the
preference between <em>Barchester Towers</em> and <em>The Warden</em>. The editors
of the Modern Library serve both factions by including the two novels
in a single volume, not so much to placate the embattled Trollopians,
but because <em>Barchester Towers</em> is, by the author’s own intention,
inseparable from <em>The Warden</em>, and is its sequel. A. Edward Newton,
author of <em>The Amenities of Book-Collecting</em> and founder of The
Trollope Society, contributes a glowing introduction to this volume.
(<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
May 1936. <em>WR</em> 16 May 1936. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Cerf wrote to Newton after the announcement of ML’s spring list: “I am
amazed and delighted at the interest that has been evinced at the mere
announcement of the first Trollope title in our Modern Library series.
We have announced the book for May publication, but it seems if we can
get it ready five or six weeks before that time, we may be able to bag a
few big school orders for the book. Accordingly, I would esteem it a
tremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in
the course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of
February. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get
all the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January
1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML
edition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date
of the 25th of the month.</p>
<p>The Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily
accessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped
that an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It
appeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER
TOWERS are published under the patronage of <span class="smallcaps">The
Trollope Society</span>” (p. [iv]). Klopfer expressed the hope that
the ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer
to Newton, 12 March 1936). But sales were disappointing and no further
works by Trollope were added to the series until <em>The Way We Live Now</em>
(639) appeared in 1984.</p>
<p><em>Barchester Towers &amp; The Warden</em> sold 3,196 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Printings with Hatcher introduction originally published 1950 in MLCE
and subsequently in the regular ML. Hatcher received $150 for the
introduction (Stein to Hatcher, 2 February 1950). Stein initially asked
Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write the introduction. Haight
declined on the grounds that he didn’t have time, but he strongly urged
that George Eliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em> be added to the ML and indicated that
he would write an introduction to that (Haight to Stein, 26 January
1950). Haight suggested that Stein contact his colleague Chauncey B.
Tinker, but Tinker also declined, as did Mary Ellen Chase (Stein to
Tinker, 26 January 1950; Tinker to Stein, 27 January 1950; Stein to
Chase, 27 January 1950). Hatcher was the fourth person that Stein
contacted.</p>

First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nCerf wrote to Newton after the announcement of ML’s spring list: “I am\namazed and delighted at the interest that has been evinced at the mere\nannouncement of the first Trollope title in our Modern Library series.\nWe have announced the book for May publication, but it seems if we can\nget it ready five or six weeks before that time, we may be able to bag a\nfew big school orders for the book. Accordingly, I would esteem it a\ntremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in\nthe course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of\nFebruary. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get\nall the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January\n1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML\nedition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date\nof the 25th of the month.\n\nThe Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily\naccessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped\nthat an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It\nappeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER\nTOWERS are published under the patronage of <span class=\"smallcaps\">The\nTrollope Society</span>” (p. \\[iv\\]). Klopfer expressed the hope that\nthe ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer\nto Newton, 12 March 1936).

A. Edward Newton,\n> author of *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* and founder of The\n> Trollope Society, contributes a glowing introduction to this volume.\n> (*Spring 1936*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nMay 1936. *WR* 16 May 1936. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nCerf wrote to Newton after the announcement of ML’s spring list: “I am\namazed and delighted at the interest that has been evinced at the mere\nannouncement of the first Trollope title in our Modern Library series.\nWe have announced the book for May publication, but it seems if we can\nget it ready five or six weeks before that time, we may be able to bag a\nfew big school orders for the book. Accordingly, I would esteem it a\ntremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in\nthe course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of\nFebruary. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get\nall the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January\n1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML\nedition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date\nof the 25th of the month.\n\nThe Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily\naccessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped\nthat an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It\nappeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER\nTOWERS are published under the patronage of <span class=\"smallcaps\">The\nTrollope Society</span>” (p. \\[iv\\]). Klopfer expressed the hope that\nthe ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer\nto Newton, 12 March 1936).
