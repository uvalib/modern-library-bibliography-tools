<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
John Addington Symond’s [<em>sic</em>] biography is more than a study of a
unique personality; it is an incarnation of the Renaissance and an
evaluation of its most titanic symbol. In the ninety years of
Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a century was consecrated to a
burning sense of beauty, which took form in his colossal plastic
figures and the impassioned sonnets. The versatile creator of the
Sistine chapel, sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and
writer completely embodies the Carlyle-Nietzschean conception of “the
hero as artist.” (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1893, in 2
volumes. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published October 1928. <em>WR</em> 3 November 1928. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The <em>PW</em> advertisement announcing the publication of <em>The Life of
Michelangelo Buonarroti</em> noted that the ML edition was “1/8 the price of

not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the
12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Even more than a study of one of the most heroic personalities of
history, John Addington Symond’s [<em>sic</em>] biography of Michelangelo
becomes an evaluation of the Renaissance and its most titanic symbol.
Of the ninety years of Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a
century was consecrated to his great works of art. The unexcelled
sculptured figures and the impassioned sonnets suggest two facets of
his complex creative personality. The painter of the Sistine Chapel,
the sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and the writer
indicate the versatility of his gifts and the richness of the heritage
he has bestowed upon mankind. (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>
