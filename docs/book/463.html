<p>Front flap:<br>
For a wide range of haunting moods and of forms of creative
expression, turn to this volume of writings by Edgar Allan Poe. At
once the master of the lyric poem of incomparable magic and the short
story of brilliant inventiveness, Poe has influenced untold numbers of
poets and writers, and even today’s science fiction remains greatly in
his debt. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also provided
notes creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet, short-story
writer, literary critic and essayist. Rarely, indeed, can a single
volume devoted to a single author present such memorable achievements
in various fields of literary effort. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Fujita non-pictorial jacket in moderate olive green (125),
moderate brown (58) and black on coated white paper; title in reverse on
moderate olive green panel at top, author in large ornamental letters in
moderate brown and black, other lettering in reverse on moderate brown
panel at foot.</p>
<p>Front and back flaps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe is one of the most original writers in American
letters. His artistic penetration into the heart of things is still
being analyzed and discussed with increasing awareness of its depth
and complexity. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also
provided notes, creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet,
short-story writer, literary critic and essayist. It presents a
comprehensive view of the man whose influence on American as well as
European literature was profound. The art of the short story in
America was significantly advanced by Poe, who also shaped the
development of the detective story.</p>
<p>Poe’s ability to blend the macabre and surreal with consummate
craftsmanship has remained a memorable contribution to American
literature. (<em>Spring/Fall 1968</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding <em>The Best Tales of Edgar Allan Poe</em>
(112). Published in MLCE June 1951 and in the regular ML fall 1953. <em>WR</em>
not found. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Mabbott received a flat fee of $250 for writing the introduction and
selecting the contents. Stein sent him an additional $100 when the
collection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June
1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been
determined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD
ARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However,
it occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we
have a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poem <em>The
Sleeper</em> on the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in
the final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He
suggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether
(Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950).</p>
<p><em>How to Write a Blackwood Article</em> does not appear in <em>The Selected
Poetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe</em>, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in
the introduction appears to have been cut. <em>The Sleeper</em> is included in
its final text.</p>
<p>“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A.
Harrison’s <em>Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe</em> by the kind permission of
the publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed
from the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case of <em>The
Cask of Amontillado</em>, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In
one or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but
preferred by most critics. Poe was a meticulous and thorough reviser of
his imaginative works, and instances of unwise revision are
exceptionally rare.” (“Note,” p. xvi)</p>
