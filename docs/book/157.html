<em>First</em> statement retained on printing with fall 1928 list.</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
It was the production of “The Emperor Jones” in 1920 that put the
final seal on Eugene O’Neill’s acceptance as one of America’s most
important dramatists.</p>
<p>The play is a story of a fear-crazed negro, told to the accompaniment
of a rhythmical drumbeat which starts at a normal pulse and is slowly
intensified until the heartbeat of the reader corresponds to the
frenzied beat of the drums.</p>
<p>“The Straw” was written in 1918—immediately preceding the composition
of “The Emperor Jones.” (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Alternative pictorial jacket on pale blue (185) paper with
inset illustration in black of a bare-chested black man making his way
through jungle foliage; lettering in black without horizontal borders
and rules. Signed: Davidson. (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket D:</em> Pictorial in strong orange (50) and black on yellow paper
with inset illustration of a bare-chested black man making his way
through jungle foliage; lettering in black, borders in strong orange.
Signed: Davidson. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Diversity of form and content, an unswerving artistic integrity and an
ever-renewing imaginative strength have given Eugene O’Neill his
unchallenged place among the first dramatists of the world. Even if
his reputation did not draw sustenance from his other published works,
his pre-eminence would be assured by <em>The Emperor Jones</em> alone. It is
a <em>tour de force</em> of heart-pounding relentlessness that strips naked
the terror-stricken soul of a Negro. <em>The Straw</em> reveals another facet
of Eugene O’Neill’s many-sided genius. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Emperor Jones</em> and <em>The Straw</em> originally published by Boni &amp;
Liveright, 1921, in a volume with O’Neill’s <em>Diff’rent</em>. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced
for April 1928. <em>WR</em> 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1937. Superseded February 1937 by <em>The Emperor
Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em> (299).</p>
<p>Dudley Nichols of the <em>New York World</em> wrote the introduction after
O’Neill declined to write it himself (Cerf to O’Neill, 7 December 1927;
Cerf to Nichols, 7 February 1928).</p>
<p>O’Neill made several revisions in the text of <em>The Emperor Jones</em> when
he prepared it for <em>The Complete Works of Eugene O’Neill</em> (2 vols., Boni
&amp; Liveright, 1924). The most notable were the cutting of speeches by
Smithers at the end of Scene One and the end of the play. In the revised
version Scene One ends as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Smithers [</span><em>Looks after him with a
puzzled admiration</em>]: ’E’s got ’is bloomin’ nerve with ’im, s’elp me.
[<em>Then angrily</em>.] Ho—the bleedin’ nigger—puttin’ on ’is bloody airs!
I ’opes they naps ’im an’ gives ’im an’ gives ’im what’s what!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original version continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<em>Then putting business before the pleasure of this thought, looking
around him with cupidity.</em>] A bloke ought to find a ’ole lot in this
palace that’d go for a bit of cash. Let’s take a look, ’Arry, me lad.
[<em>He starts for the doorway on right as</em></p>
<p>[<em>The curtain falls</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The revised version of the play ends with Lem’s dialogue: “Gawd blimey,
but yer died in the ’eighth o’ style, any’ow!” The original version
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<span class="smallcaps">Lem</span> <em>makes a motion to the soldiers
to carry the body out left</em>. <span class="smallcaps">Smithers</span>
speaks to him sneeringly.]</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Smithers</span>—And I s’pose you think it’s
yer bleedin’ charms and yer silly beatin’ the drum that made ’im run
in a circle when ’e’d lost ’imself, don’t yer? [<em>But</em> <span
class="smallcaps">Lem</span> <em>makes no reply, does not seem to hear
the question, walks out left after his men</em>. <span
class="smallcaps">Smithers</span> <em>looks after him with contemptuous
scorn.</em>] Stupid as ’ogs, the lot of ’em. Blarsted niggers!</p>
<p>[<em>Curtain falls</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Modern Library used the original version of <em>The Emperor Jones</em> in
some collections and the revised version in others. <em>The Emperor Jones;
The Straw</em> was probably set in type from <em>The Emperor Jones, Diff’rent,
The Straw</em> (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1921) and uses the original version. <em>The
Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em> (399), which superseded
<em>The Emperor Jones; The Straw</em> in the ML in 1937, also follows the
original text. The 1972 Vintage Books edition of <em>The Emperor Jones,
Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em>, which superseded the Modern Library
edition and is printed from plates made from a new typesetting, uses the
original text. The original version also appears in <em>Six Modern American
Plays</em> (441).</p>
<p>In contrast, O’Neill’s <em>Nine Plays</em> (G53), published in 1941 as a ML
Giant and printed from plates originally used by Liveright, Inc. in 1932
and later by Random House, has the revised version of <em>The Emperor
Jones</em>. The revised version also appears in the 3-volume <em>Plays of
Eugene O’Neill</em> (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition
was originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951
when <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> was added.</p>
<p><em>The Emperor Jones; The Straw</em>, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th
best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928. Sales through
1932 were as follows: 5,855 copies (1928); 2,901 copies (1929); 1,921
copies (1930); 1,405 copies (1931); 756 copies (1932) (Cerf to O’Neill,
2 June 1933).</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties to Boni &amp; Liveright of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p>O’Neill became a Random House author after the Liveright bankruptcy in
1933. Saxe Commins, his editor at Liveright, also moved to Random House.
In choosing between Coward-McCann and Random House, O’Neill wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cerf . . . has drive and enthusiasm, coupled with keen shrewdness.
Moreover, I felt Coward was trade publisher, pure and simple—but Cerf
has more to his publishing than that, a love of beautiful books, an
appreciation for good literature, an ambition to keep his firm above
the level of the others, to expand only along lines of distinction.
That, of course, appealed strongly to me. As for background for my
stuff, there is no comparison. . . . Cerf has two unique things—Modern
Library and Random House.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also thought Random House would offer better opportunities for
Commins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel strongly that Cerf is the better bet for your present and
future . . . with him, you will have a real chance to do your stuff
and a most congenial atmosphere. . . . With Cerf you’ll undoubtedly be
called upon to contribute real imagination and judgment of real
writing, once you’ve fitted in there (O’Neill to Commins, June 1933;
in Commins, ed., <em>“Love and Admiration and Respect”</em>, pp. 159-60).</p>

<h1>Although the first part of “Tristram Shandy” appeared as long ago as 1760, the editors of the Modern Library feel that they need offer no explanation for its inclusion in a series of latterday classics. Could any writing be more modern in spirit than Laurence Sterne’s—more singularly frank and unconventional? Toby Shandy is a character that will remain universally lovable and admirable for all time. (<em>1928)</em></h1>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front as jacket A.
(<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
A world deprived of the joyous and audacious spirit of <em>Tristram
Shandy</em> would be unthinkable. For two centuries Laurence Sterne’s
irrepressible book has served as an unfailing antidote for dullness
and pomposity. Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions
and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety.
Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of
temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils
its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete
and unabridged version. (<em>Spring 1934)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for April 1928. <em>WR</em> 9 June 1928. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is
traditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its
inclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R. 
H. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury
the ML abandoned after the first printing.</p>
<p>The omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of <em>Tristam Shandy</em>
traditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There
is no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there
is a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the
book by it . . .” (p. 281).</p>
<p><em>Tristram Shandy</em> was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the
first six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

(*Spring 1931*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Diversity of form and content, an unswerving artistic integrity and an\n> ever-renewing imaginative strength have given Eugene O’Neill his\n> unchallenged place among the first dramatists of the world.

The revised version also appears in the 3-volume *Plays of\nEugene O’Neill* (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition\nwas originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951\nwhen *The Iceman Cometh* was added.\n\n*The Emperor Jones; The Straw*, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th\nbest-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928.

(*Spring 1928*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.\n\n> Text on front:<br>\n# Although the first part of “Tristram Shandy” appeared as long ago as 1760, the editors of the Modern Library feel that they need offer no explanation for its inclusion in a series of latterday classics. Could any writing be more modern in spirit than Laurence Sterne’s—more singularly frank and unconventional? Toby Shandy is a character that will remain universally lovable and admirable for all time. (*1928)*\n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front as jacket A.\n(*Spring 1929*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> A world deprived of the joyous and audacious spirit of *Tristram\n> Shandy* would be unthinkable. For two centuries Laurence Sterne’s\n> irrepressible book has served as an unfailing antidote for dullness\n> and pomposity. Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions\n> and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety.\n> Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of\n> temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils\n> its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete\n> and unabridged version. (*Spring 1934)*\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for April 1928. *WR* 9 June 1928. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is\ntraditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its\ninclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R. \nH. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury\nthe ML abandoned after the first printing.\n\nThe omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of *Tristam Shandy*\ntraditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There\nis no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there\nis a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the\nbook by it . . .” (p. 281).\n\n*Tristram Shandy* was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the\nfirst six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 158.1b.
