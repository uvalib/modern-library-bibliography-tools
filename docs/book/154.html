<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:
Merejkowski’s trilogy of historical romances, collectively entitled <em>Christ and Antichrist</em>, have been translated from the original Russian into every European language. <em>The Death of the Gods</em> is the first of the three, and has for its central figure Julian the Apostate; <em>Leonardo</em> is the second; and the third is <em>Peter and Alexis</em>, which is based on the tragic story of Peter the Great and his son. Despite the fact that <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> has been heretofore available only in very expensive editions in America, its popularity has increased each year. Mr. Guerney’s new and complete translation for the Modern Library brings within the reach of many new thousands of readers the best biography of what was probably the most versatile genius in all history. (<em>Fall 1927; spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial on light yellowish green (135) paper with inset right profile drawing of Leonardo in black; lettering in black without horizontal borders and rules. Signed: M.S. [Max Schwartz]. (<em>Spring 1928</em>) <em>Note:</em> Used on copies sold as part of Three Renaissance Romances gift box, Christmas 1928.</p>

<p><em>Jacket E:</em> Pictorial in green and black on cream paper with drawing as jacket B; lettering in black, borders in green. Signed: M.S. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>F:</em> Typographic in grayish reddish brown (46) and black on yellow paper with torchbearer omitted from front panel and title (THE | ROMANCE OF | LEONARDO | DA VINCI) and borders in grayish reddish brown; other lettering in black. (<em>Fall 1931</em>) Later printings in dark purplish gray (234) with front flap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The insatiable spirit and the unparalleled genius of Leonardo Da [<em>sic</em>] Vinci give radiance to this biographical romance. The heroic grandeur of Leonardo’s achievements in art and science, the fecundity of his mind and the illimitable reaches of his imagination are revealed against the glowing background of the Renaissance. Kings and popes and courtiers, artists and philosophers and poets throng the scene. Dominating them all is Leonardo in a portrait that might have been wrought by one of his own contemporaries. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML translation. Published 1 March 1928. <em>WR</em> 17 March 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Publication was originally announced for November 1927 on the basis of Guerney’s promise of a finished manuscript by the beginning of September. The translation took longer than expected; the ML did not receive final installment until 13 January 1928 (Cerf to Ronald Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 14 January 1928).</p>
<p><em>The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em> sold 12,264 copies during the first six months of 1928, making it the ML’s best-selling title. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold nearly 76,000 copies during its first five years with annual sales as follows: 23,651 copies (1928); 20,933 copies (1929); 14,447 copies (1930); 9,404 copies (1931); and 7,334 copies (1932) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). It was the ML’s best-selling title during the first half of 1928, with sales of 12,264 copies. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it sold 4,736 copies, placing it in the third quarter of ML sales.</p>

(*Fall 1931*) Later printings in dark purplish gray (234) with front flap:  \n\n> The insatiable spirit and the unparalleled genius of Leonardo Da [*sic*] Vinci give radiance to this biographical romance. The heroic grandeur of Leonardo’s achievements in art and science, the fecundity of his mind and the illimitable reaches of his imagination are revealed against the glowing background of the Renaissance. Kings and popes and courtiers, artists and philosophers and poets throng the scene. Dominating them all is Leonardo in a portrait that might have been wrought by one of his own contemporaries. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginal ML translation. Published 1 March 1928. *WR* 17 March 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nPublication was originally announced for November 1927 on the basis of Guerney’s promise of a finished manuscript by the beginning of September. The translation took longer than expected; the ML did not receive final installment until 13 January 1928 (Cerf to Ronald Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 14 January 1928).  \n\n*The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* sold 12,264 copies during the first six months of 1928, making it the ML’s best-selling title. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\nThe ML edition sold nearly 76,000 copies during its first five years with annual sales as follows: 23,651 copies (1928); 20,933 copies (1929); 14,447 copies (1930); 9,404 copies (1931); and 7,334 copies (1932) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). It was the ML’s best-selling title during the first half of 1928, with sales of 12,264 copies. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it sold 4,736 copies, placing it in the third quarter of ML sales.  \n\n#### 154b.

Signed: M.S. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n*Jacket* *F:* Typographic in grayish reddish brown (46) and black on yellow paper with torchbearer omitted from front panel and title (THE | ROMANCE OF | LEONARDO | DA VINCI) and borders in grayish reddish brown; other lettering in black. (*Fall 1931*) Later printings in dark purplish gray (234) with front flap:  \n\n> The insatiable spirit and the unparalleled genius of Leonardo Da [*sic*] Vinci give radiance to this biographical romance. The heroic grandeur of Leonardo’s achievements in art and science, the fecundity of his mind and the illimitable reaches of his imagination are revealed against the glowing background of the Renaissance. Kings and popes and courtiers, artists and philosophers and poets throng the scene. Dominating them all is Leonardo in a portrait that might have been wrought by one of his own contemporaries. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginal ML translation. Published 1 March 1928. *WR* 17 March 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nPublication was originally announced for November 1927 on the basis of Guerney’s promise of a finished manuscript by the beginning of September. The translation took longer than expected; the ML did not receive final installment until 13 January 1928 (Cerf to Ronald Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 14 January 1928).  \n\n*The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* sold 12,264 copies during the first six months of 1928, making it the ML’s best-selling title. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\nThe ML edition sold nearly 76,000 copies during its first five years with annual sales as follows: 23,651 copies (1928); 20,933 copies (1929); 14,447 copies (1930); 9,404 copies (1931); and 7,334 copies (1932) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). It was the ML’s best-selling title during the first half of 1928, with sales of 12,264 copies. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it sold 4,736 copies, placing it in the third quarter of ML sales.  \n\n"
