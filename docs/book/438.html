<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The third full-length novel and the fourth title in the Modern Library
series by Joseph Conrad (<em>Lord Jim</em>, No. 186, <em>Victory</em>, No. 34, and
“Heart of Darkness” in <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em>, No. 168),
<em>Nostromo</em> is regarded by devoted Conradians as his most exciting tale
of high adventure. The story of a man of fabulous daring somewhere on
the South American seaboard during the turmoil of a revolution is far
more than the recital of astounding feats; it is a drama of
large-scale conflicts against a background of a strange land and the
vast sea, told with power and insight and the subtle interplay of
light and shadow. Robert Penn Warren, author of <em>All the King’s Men</em>
and <em>World Enough and Time</em>, contributes an illuminating and
perceptive introduction. (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Bros., 1904; subsequently
published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.; author’s “Note” added 1918. ML
edition printed from Harper/Doubleday plates. Publication announced for
spring 1951. <em>WR</em> 3 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1983.</p>
<p>Published 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. The ML paid Doubleday
royalties of 8 cents a copy for the ML edition. Stein asked several
professors about including <em>Nostromo</em> in MLCE and decided to go ahead
despite the lukewarm response. Doubleday wanted it to be included in
both the regular ML and MLCE because royalties for the MLCE edition were
only 2 cents a copy. Doubleday indicated that two sets of plates were
available, one of 631 pages in excellent shape and one of 537 pages in
poor condition. Stein recommended that <em>Nostromo</em> be included in the
regular ML and that the better plates be used (Stein memo to Haas, 15
August 1950).</p>
<p>After <em>Nostromo</em> entered the public domain Klopfer inquired if a lower
royalty would be appropriate. He was informed that Doubleday continued
to receive full royalties on other editions and replied, “As long as
everybody else is paying regular royalties certainly I don’t want to
alter the terms. It’s just when a book actually gets kicked around in
the public domain that we feel a change in arrangements should be made”
(Klopfer to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 14 November 1963; Barbara Drysdale,
Doubleday, to Klopfer, 6 December 1963; Klopfer to Drysdale, 12 December
1963).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Joseph Conrad is considered by many critics to be the best English
novelist of his generation, and <em>Nostromo</em> is often mentioned as the
greatest of his novels. Written in 1904, <em>Nostromo</em> is set in a small
South American country. Against this tropical background Conrad has
assembled an unusual assortment of men. Empire builder, rebel leader
and outcast are all involved in conflicts of heroic proportions. The
tragic values embodied in this novel make it apparent why Conrad
thought of it as his most finely worked creation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Set in the civil-war-torn Central American Republic of Costaguana,
<em>Nostromo</em> is “a complex of personal stories,” Robert Penn Warren
observes, involving conflicts of heroic proportions and tragic
consequences. From the materialist Charles Gould, owner of the Gould
Concession of the San Tomé mine, and the traitorous Dr. Monygham, to
old Georgio Viola and the sceptic Decoud, each character lives an
illusion next to the “natural” man Nostromo and the beneficent Emilia
Gould. A novel that reveals the nefarious effects of unbridled greed
and imperialist interests, <em>Nostromo</em> upholds Conrad’s belief in
fidelity, moral discipline, and the need for human communion. Conrad
himself described it as “an intense creative effort on what I suppose
will remain my largest canvas,” and it is considered one of his
greatest works. It is an exemplary statement of his conviction that
“the solidarity of all mankind” rests upon “simple ideas and sincere
emotions.”</p>
<p>Written in 1904, the text reprinted here is based on the revised
edition of 1925, including the Author’s Note and an introduction by
Robert Penn Warren.</p>

Signed: Galdone.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The third full-length novel and the fourth title in the Modern Library\n> series by Joseph Conrad (*Lord Jim*, No. 186, *Victory*, No. 34, and\n> “Heart of Darkness” in *Great Modern Short Stories*, No. 168),\n> *Nostromo* is regarded by devoted Conradians as his most exciting tale\n> of high adventure. The story of a man of fabulous daring somewhere on\n> the South American seaboard during the turmoil of a revolution is far\n> more than the recital of astounding feats; it is a drama of\n> large-scale conflicts against a background of a strange land and the\n> vast sea, told with power and insight and the subtle interplay of\n> light and shadow. Robert Penn Warren, author of *All the King’s Men*\n> and *World Enough and Time*, contributes an illuminating and\n> perceptive introduction. (*Spring 1951*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Bros., 1904; subsequently\npublished by Doubleday, Page & Co.; author’s “Note” added 1918. ML\nedition printed from Harper/Doubleday plates. Publication announced for\nspring 1951. *WR* 3 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1983.\n\nPublished 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. The ML paid Doubleday\nroyalties of 8 cents a copy for the ML edition. Stein asked several\nprofessors about including *Nostromo* in MLCE and decided to go ahead\ndespite the lukewarm response. Doubleday wanted it to be included in\nboth the regular ML and MLCE because royalties for the MLCE edition were\nonly 2 cents a copy. Doubleday indicated that two sets of plates were\navailable, one of 631 pages in excellent shape and one of 537 pages in\npoor condition. Stein recommended that *Nostromo* be included in the\nregular ML and that the better plates be used (Stein memo to Haas, 15\nAugust 1950).\n\nAfter *Nostromo* entered the public domain Klopfer inquired if a lower\nroyalty would be appropriate. He was informed that Doubleday continued\nto receive full royalties on other editions and replied, “As long as\neverybody else is paying regular royalties certainly I don’t want to\nalter the terms. It’s just when a book actually gets kicked around in\nthe public domain that we feel a change in arrangements should be made”\n(Klopfer to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 14 November 1963; Barbara Drysdale,\nDoubleday, to Klopfer, 6 December 1963; Klopfer to Drysdale, 12 December\n1963).\n\n#### 438.2a.

From the materialist Charles Gould, owner of the Gould\n> Concession of the San Tomé mine, and the traitorous Dr. Monygham, to\n> old Georgio Viola and the sceptic Decoud, each character lives an\n> illusion next to the “natural” man Nostromo and the beneficent Emilia\n> Gould. A novel that reveals the nefarious effects of unbridled greed\n> and imperialist interests, *Nostromo* upholds Conrad’s belief in\n> fidelity, moral discipline, and the need for human communion. Conrad\n> himself described it as “an intense creative effort on what I suppose\n> will remain my largest canvas,” and it is considered one of his\n> greatest works. It is an exemplary statement of his conviction that\n> “the solidarity of all mankind” rests upon “simple ideas and sincere\n> emotions.”\n>\n> Written in 1904, the text reprinted here is based on the revised\n> edition of 1925, including the Author’s Note and an introduction by\n> Robert Penn Warren.\n\nPublished spring 1983 at $8.95.
