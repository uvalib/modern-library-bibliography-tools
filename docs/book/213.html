<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant</em>: Pagination and collation as 213a. Contents as 213a except: [1] dedication; [191–196] ML list. (<em>Fall 1934</em>) <em>Note:</em> The dedication, which had been omitted from the first printing, replaces the fly title.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in pale purplish blue (203) and black on coated white paper depicting a horse-drawn caravan; borders and title in reverse, other lettering in black. Signed: J.E.S. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Scratch a book seller and you find an evangelist of literature, a quaint idealist and a grim fighter for the holy cause of enlightenment. And who better embodies all the quixotic zeal of the book missionary than Professor Roger Mifflin as he rides through the countryside with his caravan of culture? Pegasus, hitched to his wagon-load of books, carries him and the liberated Helen McGill to adventures and a romance as charming as any on the shelves of his wandering library. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1917. ML edition (pp. [1]–190) printed from Doubleday, Doran (and subsequently Lippincott) plates with Morley’s preface, “A Letter to David Grayson, Esq.,” omitted and the dedication omitted in the first printing. Publication initially announced for August 1931. Published March 1931. <em>WR</em> 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1955.</p>
<p><em>Parnassus on Wheels</em> was the second of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s books—<em>The Haunted Bookshop</em> was also in the Sun Dial Library—and settled on <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em>. Publication was announced for August 1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so great,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to bring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML wrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new printing they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had been sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged with Lippincott.</p>
<p>Morley’s novel <em>Kitty Foyle</em> was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished after the United States entered the Second World War. <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em> sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles—and he had two books in that category. <em>Human Being</em> (334), which lasted just over five years in the series, outsold <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em> by nearly 300 copies.</p>

  "full": "\n**CHRISTOPHER MORLEY. PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. 1931–1954. (ML 190)**  \n\n#### 213a. First printing (1931)  \n\n[within double rules] PARNASSUS ON | WHEELS | [rule] | BY | CHRISTOPHER MORLEY | [rule] | [torchbearer A2] | [rule] | BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK  \n\nPp. [*4*], [1–2] 3–190 [191–196]. [1–6]<sup>16</sup> [7]<sup>4</sup>  \n\n[*1*] half title; [*2*] pub. note A6; [*3*] title; [*4*] *Copyright,* 1917, 1925, *by* DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & CO. | [short double rule] | *First Modern Library Edition* | 1931; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–190 text; [191–194] ML list; [195–196] blank. (*Spring 1931*) *Note:* Dedication omitted.  \n\n> *Variant*: Pagination and collation as 213a. Contents as 213a except: [1] dedication; [191–196] ML list. (*Fall 1934*) *Note:* The dedication, which had been omitted from the first printing, replaces the fly title.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in pale purplish blue (203) and black on coated white paper depicting a horse-drawn caravan; borders and title in reverse, other lettering in black. Signed: J.E.S. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Scratch a book seller and you find an evangelist of literature, a quaint idealist and a grim fighter for the holy cause of enlightenment. And who better embodies all the quixotic zeal of the book missionary than Professor Roger Mifflin as he rides through the countryside with his caravan of culture? Pegasus, hitched to his wagon-load of books, carries him and the liberated Helen McGill to adventures and a romance as charming as any on the shelves of his wandering library. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1917. ML edition (pp. [1]–190) printed from Doubleday, Doran (and subsequently Lippincott) plates with Morley’s preface, “A Letter to David Grayson, Esq.,” omitted and the dedication omitted in the first printing. Publication initially announced for August 1931. Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1955.  \n\n*Parnassus on Wheels* was the second of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s books—*The Haunted Bookshop* was also in the Sun Dial Library—and settled on *Parnassus on Wheels*. Publication was announced for August 1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so great,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to bring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML wrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new printing they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had been sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged with Lippincott.  \n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished after the United States entered the Second World War. *Parnassus on Wheels* sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles—and he had two books in that category. *Human Being* (334), which lasted just over five years in the series, outsold *Parnassus on Wheels* by nearly 300 copies.  \n\n#### 213b.

Signed: J.E.S. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Scratch a book seller and you find an evangelist of literature, a quaint idealist and a grim fighter for the holy cause of enlightenment. And who better embodies all the quixotic zeal of the book missionary than Professor Roger Mifflin as he rides through the countryside with his caravan of culture? Pegasus, hitched to his wagon-load of books, carries him and the liberated Helen McGill to adventures and a romance as charming as any on the shelves of his wandering library. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1917. ML edition (pp. [1]–190) printed from Doubleday, Doran (and subsequently Lippincott) plates with Morley’s preface, “A Letter to David Grayson, Esq.,” omitted and the dedication omitted in the first printing. Publication initially announced for August 1931. Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1955.  \n\n*Parnassus on Wheels* was the second of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s books—*The Haunted Bookshop* was also in the Sun Dial Library—and settled on *Parnassus on Wheels*. Publication was announced for August 1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so great,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to bring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML wrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new printing they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had been sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged with Lippincott.  \n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished after the United States entered the Second World War. *Parnassus on Wheels* sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title.
