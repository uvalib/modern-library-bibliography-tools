</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Thomas Hardy’s conviction that men and women “are but helpless puppets
in the hands of mischievous fate” is carried to its most relentless
conclusion in “Jude the Obscure”. Such a storm arose after its
publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another
novel.</p>
<p>“Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first
time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all
its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as
one of his most unforgettable creations.</p>
<p>(Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern
Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (<em>Fall
1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave,
pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but
suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and
inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels.
By common consent, <em>Jude the Obscure</em> is his masterpiece. Since its
publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and
is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of
fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex
and instinct. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74), deep
reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving
in black of a town street with cottage at left, tree at right and church
tower in background; lettering in black and in reverse, all (including
wood engraving) against strong yellowish brown background and enclosed
in triple-rule frame in deep reddish orange. Signed: Galdone. Front flap
as jacket B. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1895. ML edition
(145.1, pp. [<em>5</em>–7], [<em>10</em>]–488) printed from a set of 1895 Harper
plates with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September
1927. <em>WR</em> 5 November 1927. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued
1990.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were six
additional printings totaling 16,000 copies between 1928 and 1931;
printings between 1932 and 1939 totaled 11,000 copies. The ML’s printers
damaged the plate for p. 107 sometime between 1929 and 1932; the last
three lines of that page are missing in one or more printings from that
period. The plate was repaired after Klopfer pointed out the problem
(Klopfer to Harper &amp; Bros., 13 April 1933; A. W. Rushmore, Harper &amp;
Bros., to Klopfer, 17 April 1933).</p>

Such a storm arose after its\n> publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another\n> novel.\n>\n> “Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first\n> time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all\n> its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as\n> one of his most unforgettable creations.\n>\n> (Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern\n> Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (*Fall\n> 1928*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave,\n> pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but\n> suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and\n> inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels.\n> By common consent, *Jude the Obscure* is his masterpiece. Since its\n> publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and\n> is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of\n> fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex\n> and instinct. (*Fall 1935*)\n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74), deep\nreddish orange (36) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving\nin black of a town street with cottage at left, tree at right and church\ntower in background; lettering in black and in reverse, all (including\nwood engraving) against strong yellowish brown background and enclosed\nin triple-rule frame in deep reddish orange.

First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued\n1990.\n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were six\nadditional printings totaling 16,000 copies between 1928 and 1931;\nprintings between 1932 and 1939 totaled 11,000 copies. The ML’s printers\ndamaged the plate for p. 107 sometime between 1929 and 1932; the last\nthree lines of that page are missing in one or more printings from that\nperiod. The plate was repaired after Klopfer pointed out the problem\n(Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 13 April 1933; A. W. Rushmore, Harper &\nBros., to Klopfer, 17 April 1933).\n\n#### 145.1b.
