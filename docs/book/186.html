<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in moderate red (15) and black on yellow paper
with illustration of Achilles with spear and shield and Troy in flames
in background; title and borders in moderate red, other lettering in
black. Unsigned but probably by Staloff, the designer of the companion
jacket for <em>The Odyssey</em> (187.1a jacket B). (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none
is in greater favor than Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> and its companion volume,
<em>The Odyssey</em> (No. 167). The immortal epic of the wrath of Achilles
and the siege of Troy is as vivid to the contemporary reader as it
must have been to Homer’s first enraptured listeners seven centuries
before the Christian era, and as it has remained through the ages in
its various renderings. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation was chosen
upon the urgent advice of the leading authorities in England and
America. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lang-Leaf-Myers translation originally published in U.S. by the
Macmillan Co., 1883. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published December 1929. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing:
Not ascertained. Superseded fall 1964 by Rees translation (186.2).</p>
<p>The ML originally planned to use the 17th-century translations of George
Chapman for its editions of Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. Advance
advertising referred to the Chapman translations, as did fall 1929
catalogs and ML lists—including the lists inside first printings of the
Homer jackets. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of <em>The Iliad</em> and the
Butcher and Lang translation of <em>The Odyssey</em> were substituted at the
last moment on the advice of several college professors. “We discovered
that we could sell five times as many books in the new translation as we
could have had we used the Chapman, since the Lang, Leaf, and Myers one
is used in almost all of the colleges” (Cerf to George M. McKanday,
Macmillan Co. of Canada, 25 November 1930).</p>
<p>The Prefatory Note (p. [<em>5</em>]) indicates that Books I–IX were
translated by Leaf, X–XVI by Lang, and XVII–XXIV by Myers, but that the
whole was revised by all three translators.</p>
<p>The ML hoped to use Macmillan plates, but Macmillan had to secure
approval from its parent firm in London and was unable to make a solid
offer until the end of October. By that time the ML had begun
composition so that the books could be published in December.</p>
<p><em>The Iliad</em> ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles
during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and rose into the lower
part of the first quarter during the 12-month period November
1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 122,292 copies by spring 1958.</p>

<p>Highet received $300 for his introductions to <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The
Odyssey</em> (Stein to Highet, 26 January 1950). The first section of the
introductions (“The World of the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>”) is common
to both volumes, as is the bibliography. Highet’s introductions were
also included in printings of <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em> in Modern
Library College Editions, which were introduced in fall 1950. Most of
the introductions written for MLCE appeared first in that series and
were subsequently added to regular ML printings.</p>
<p>The Prefatory Note and the poems on pp. [<em>6</em>] and [465] of 186.1a–b
are omitted from 186.1c.</p>
<p>Myers’s name was misspelled on the reset title page. Highet pointed out
the error shortly after publication (Highet to Crary, 8 September 1950).
There is a memo in the RH Papers ordering the correction on the MLCE
title page. The title page of the regular ML edition does not appear to
have been corrected.</p>

(*Fall 1929*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in moderate red (15) and black on yellow paper\nwith illustration of Achilles with spear and shield and Troy in flames\nin background; title and borders in moderate red, other lettering in\nblack. Unsigned but probably by Staloff, the designer of the companion\njacket for *The Odyssey* (187.1a jacket B). (*Fall 1931*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Of the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none\n> is in greater favor than Homer’s *Iliad* and its companion volume,\n> *The Odyssey* (No. 167). The immortal epic of the wrath of Achilles\n> and the siege of Troy is as vivid to the contemporary reader as it\n> must have been to Homer’s first enraptured listeners seven centuries\n> before the Christian era, and as it has remained through the ages in\n> its various renderings. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation was chosen\n> upon the urgent advice of the leading authorities in England and\n> America. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nLang-Leaf-Myers translation originally published in U.S. by the\nMacmillan Co., 1883. ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published December 1929. *WR* not found. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Superseded fall 1964 by Rees translation (186.2).\n\nThe ML originally planned to use the 17th-century translations of George\nChapman for its editions of Homer’s *Iliad* and *Odyssey*. Advance\nadvertising referred to the Chapman translations, as did fall 1929\ncatalogs and ML lists—including the lists inside first printings of the\nHomer jackets. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *The Iliad* and the\nButcher and Lang translation of *The Odyssey* were substituted at the\nlast moment on the advice of several college professors. “We discovered\nthat we could sell five times as many books in the new translation as we\ncould have had we used the Chapman, since the Lang, Leaf, and Myers one\nis used in almost all of the colleges” (Cerf to George M. McKanday,\nMacmillan Co. of Canada, 25 November 1930).\n\nThe Prefatory Note (p. \\[*5*\\]) indicates that Books I–IX were\ntranslated by Leaf, X–XVI by Lang, and XVII–XXIV by Myers, but that the\nwhole was revised by all three translators.\n\nThe ML hoped to use Macmillan plates, but Macmillan had to secure\napproval from its parent firm in London and was unable to make a solid\noffer until the end of October. By that time the ML had begun\ncomposition so that the books could be published in December.\n\n*The Iliad* ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles\nduring the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and rose into the lower\npart of the first quarter during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 122,292 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 186.1b.

(*Spring 1957*)\n\nHighet received $300 for his introductions to *The Iliad* and *The\nOdyssey* (Stein to Highet, 26 January 1950). The first section of the\nintroductions (“The World of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*”) is common\nto both volumes, as is the bibliography. Highet’s introductions were\nalso included in printings of *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey* in Modern\nLibrary College Editions, which were introduced in fall 1950. Most of\nthe introductions written for MLCE appeared first in that series and\nwere subsequently added to regular ML printings.\n\nThe Prefatory Note and the poems on pp. \\[*6*\\] and \\[465\\] of 186.1a–b\nare omitted from 186.1c.\n\nMyers’s name was misspelled on the reset title page. Highet pointed out\nthe error shortly after publication (Highet to Crary, 8 September 1950).\nThere is a memo in the RH Papers ordering the correction on the MLCE\ntitle page. The title page of the regular ML edition does not appear to\nhave been corrected.",
