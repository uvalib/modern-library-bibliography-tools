<h4>322a. First printing (1939)</h4>

<p>[<em>1</em>] half title; [<em>2</em>] <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='publishers note' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/notes/D18.webp'>pub. note D18</uvalib-modal-image-button>; [<em>3</em>] title; [<em>4</em>] <em>Copyright, 1936, by</em> JOHN STEINBECK | [short double rule] | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | 1939; [<em>5</em>] biographical note; [<em>6</em>] blank; [<em>7</em>] epigraph from Paradise Lost; [<em>8</em>] author’s note; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–343 text; [344] blank.</p>
<p><em>Format:</em> 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. (181 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and Blumenthal binding. Steinbeck, <em>In Dubious Battle</em> and Six <em>Plays of Clifford Odets</em> (321) and were the first titles to be published in the ML’s larger 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format after it was adopted for all ML titles and the first to appear in the newly designed Blumenthal binding.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in brilliant greenish yellow (98) and black on coated white paper with multicolor illustration of itinerant fruit pickers—men, women, and children—walking along a road followed by a truck carrying more workers; lettering in reverse on black panels above and below the illustration; backstrip in brilliant greenish yellow with lettering in black. Illustration signed at lower right: [Valenti] Angelo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Everyone who has been stirred by John Steinbeck’s <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> must turn to <em>In Dubious Battle</em> to discover the source from which his most famous book drew its strength and deep humanity. In all his novels Steinbeck is preeminently the story-teller. In <em>In Dubious Battle</em> he is at the crest of his powers as he dramatizes the plight of men and women fighting for their lives. A common cause animates their struggle, and their heroism makes the narrative soar from climax to climax. (<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Covici, Friede, 1936; new bibliographical edition published by Viking Press, August 1939. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>]–343) printed from Viking plates. Published September 1939. <em>WR</em> 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML secured exclusive reprint rights to <em>In Dubious Battle</em> shortly before the publication of <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> in 1939 vastly enlarged Steinbeck’s audience. An earlier reprint had been published by Blue Ribbon Books in October 1937, but it sold poorly and was out of print by November 1938. Lewis Miller expected the success of <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> to stimulate interest in all of Steinbeck’s books (Miller to Crowder, 11 July 1939). In a memo to the sales force he urged the travelers to open their sales talks with <em>In Dubious Battle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We got the sole reprint rights before GRAPES OF WRATH leaped to best-sellerdom and very lucky, too, for I am convinced it would have been more advantageous to the Viking crowd to have given the book to Grosset as well as to us. We would in that case have shared the market and perhaps not a big share either. If Grosset had IN DUBIOUS BATTLE they would get an advance of 20,000 to 25,000 copies, in my judgment. We are looking for an 8,000 to 10,000 advance on the strength of the fact that this brand new army of Steinbeck readers is now wide open for his past work. Every bookstore you call on has sold good quantities of GRAPES OF WRATH and that’s the market for IN DUBIOUS BATTLE. . . . Remember that IN DUBIOUS BATTLE does not take up much room and you have got to get at least a 25-stack if you expect the public to see it. We want 25’s, 50’s and 100’s. If a dealer buries this title on a shelf in 1’s and 2’s, we are licked before we start. (RH Box 153, Sales folder)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML distributed a four-color display poster to bookstores that described <em>In Dubious Battle</em> as “a long, full, satisfying novel that deals with the same kind of characters and the same background as THE GRAPES OF WRATH” and launched a $7,500 advertising campaign that featured <em>In Dubious Battle</em> along with Steinbeck’s other ML titles, <em>Tortilla Flat</em> and <em>Of Mice and Men</em> (<em>PW</em>, 5 August 1939, p. 351). A special discount was offered for combination orders of all three Steinbeck titles: 41 percent for 50 copies, 40 + 5 percent for 100 copies, and 44 percent for of 250 copies. The 40 + 5 percent discount was normally reserved for the ML’s biggest customers, such as Brentano’s, Macy’s, and Marshall Field &amp; Co., who obtained ML books (list price 95 cents) for 55 cents instead of the 57 cents paid by booksellers who got a straight 40 percent discount. Booksellers who received this discount were expected to promote the series aggressively.</p>
<p>“You can see the leverage you get with such a schedule,” Miller told the travelers. “You may get a dealer who can buy only 25 IN DUBIOUS BATTLE and you now have got a wedge to get 25 assorted out of the other two. And so on, up the scale” (RH Box 153, Sales folder). He also reminded them, “In selling this title don’t overlook the point that, because the book will be bound in stiff covers, it lends itself admirably to lending library use in addition to over-the-counter sales” (Miller to Consolino, 31 July 1939).</p>
<p><em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> led the 1939 best-seller list and remained one of the ten best-selling fiction titles in 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29). Sales figures for the ML edition of <em>In Dubious Battle</em> are not available for 1939 and 1940. The ML edition of <em>In Dubious Battle</em> sold 6,028 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles—but by then <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> itself was available in the ML. <em>In Dubious Battle</em> was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

  "full": "\n**JOHN STEINBECK. IN DUBIOUS BATTLE. 1939–1971. (ML 115)**  \n\n#### 322a. First printing (1939)  \n\n[within double rules] IN | DUBIOUS | BATTLE | [rule] | BY | JOHN STEINBECK | [rule] | [torchbearer A2] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK  \n\nPp. [*8*], [1–2] 3–343 [344]. [1–10]<sup>16</sup> [11–12]<sup>8</sup>  \n\n[*1*] half title; [*2*] pub. note D18; [*3*] title; [*4*] *Copyright, 1936, by* JOHN STEINBECK | [short double rule] | *First Modern Library Edition* | 1939; [*5*] biographical note; [*6*] blank; [*7*] epigraph from Paradise Lost; [*8*] author’s note; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–343 text; [344] blank.  \n\n*Format:* 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. (181 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and Blumenthal binding. Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* and Six *Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) and were the first titles to be published in the ML’s larger 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format after it was adopted for all ML titles and the first to appear in the newly designed Blumenthal binding.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in brilliant greenish yellow (98) and black on coated white paper with multicolor illustration of itinerant fruit pickers—men, women, and children—walking along a road followed by a truck carrying more workers; lettering in reverse on black panels above and below the illustration; backstrip in brilliant greenish yellow with lettering in black. Illustration signed at lower right: [Valenti] Angelo.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Everyone who has been stirred by John Steinbeck’s *The Grapes of Wrath* must turn to *In Dubious Battle* to discover the source from which his most famous book drew its strength and deep humanity. In all his novels Steinbeck is preeminently the story-teller. In *In Dubious Battle* he is at the crest of his powers as he dramatizes the plight of men and women fighting for their lives. A common cause animates their struggle, and their heroism makes the narrative soar from climax to climax. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published by Covici, Friede, 1936; new bibliographical edition published by Viking Press, August 1939. ML edition (pp. [*7*]–343) printed from Viking plates. Published September 1939. *WR* 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nThe ML secured exclusive reprint rights to *In Dubious Battle* shortly before the publication of *The Grapes of Wrath* in 1939 vastly enlarged Steinbeck’s audience. An earlier reprint had been published by Blue Ribbon Books in October 1937, but it sold poorly and was out of print by November 1938. Lewis Miller expected the success of *The Grapes of Wrath* to stimulate interest in all of Steinbeck’s books (Miller to Crowder, 11 July 1939). In a memo to the sales force he urged the travelers to open their sales talks with *In Dubious Battle*:  \n\n> We got the sole reprint rights before GRAPES OF WRATH leaped to best-sellerdom and very lucky, too, for I am convinced it would have been more advantageous to the Viking crowd to have given the book to Grosset as well as to us. We would in that case have shared the market and perhaps not a big share either. If Grosset had IN DUBIOUS BATTLE they would get an advance of 20,000 to 25,000 copies, in my judgment. We are looking for an 8,000 to 10,000 advance on the strength of the fact that this brand new army of Steinbeck readers is now wide open for his past work. Every bookstore you call on has sold good quantities of GRAPES OF WRATH and that’s the market for IN DUBIOUS BATTLE. . . . Remember that IN DUBIOUS BATTLE does not take up much room and you have got to get at least a 25-stack if you expect the public to see it. We want 25’s, 50’s and 100’s. If a dealer buries this title on a shelf in 1’s and 2’s, we are licked before we start. (RH Box 153, Sales folder)  \n\nThe ML distributed a four-color display poster to bookstores that described *In Dubious Battle* as “a long, full, satisfying novel that deals with the same kind of characters and the same background as THE GRAPES OF WRATH” and launched a \\$7,500 advertising campaign that featured *In Dubious Battle* along with Steinbeck’s other ML titles, *Tortilla Flat* and *Of Mice and Men* (*PW*, 5 August 1939, p. 351). A special discount was offered for combination orders of all three Steinbeck titles: 41 percent for 50 copies, 40 + 5 percent for 100 copies, and 44 percent for of 250 copies. The 40 + 5 percent discount was normally reserved for the ML’s biggest customers, such as Brentano’s, Macy’s, and Marshall Field & Co., who obtained ML books (list price 95 cents) for 55 cents instead of the 57 cents paid by booksellers who got a straight 40 percent discount. Booksellers who received this discount were expected to promote the series aggressively.  \n\n“You can see the leverage you get with such a schedule,” Miller told the travelers. “You may get a dealer who can buy only 25 IN DUBIOUS BATTLE and you now have got a wedge to get 25 assorted out of the other two. And so on, up the scale” (RH Box 153, Sales folder). He also reminded them, “In selling this title don’t overlook the point that, because the book will be bound in stiff covers, it lends itself admirably to lending library use in addition to over-the-counter sales” (Miller to Consolino, 31 July 1939).  \n\n*The Grapes of Wrath* led the 1939 best-seller list and remained one of the ten best-selling fiction titles in 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29). Sales figures for the ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* are not available for 1939 and 1940. The ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* sold 6,028 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles—but by then *The Grapes of Wrath* itself was available in the ML. *In Dubious Battle* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 322b.

Illustration signed at lower right: [Valenti] Angelo.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Everyone who has been stirred by John Steinbeck’s *The Grapes of Wrath* must turn to *In Dubious Battle* to discover the source from which his most famous book drew its strength and deep humanity. In all his novels Steinbeck is preeminently the story-teller. In *In Dubious Battle* he is at the crest of his powers as he dramatizes the plight of men and women fighting for their lives. A common cause animates their struggle, and their heroism makes the narrative soar from climax to climax. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published by Covici, Friede, 1936; new bibliographical edition published by Viking Press, August 1939. ML edition (pp. [*7*]–343) printed from Viking plates. Published September 1939. *WR* 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nThe ML secured exclusive reprint rights to *In Dubious Battle* shortly before the publication of *The Grapes of Wrath* in 1939 vastly enlarged Steinbeck’s audience. An earlier reprint had been published by Blue Ribbon Books in October 1937, but it sold poorly and was out of print by November 1938. Lewis Miller expected the success of *The Grapes of Wrath* to stimulate interest in all of Steinbeck’s books (Miller to Crowder, 11 July 1939). In a memo to the sales force he urged the travelers to open their sales talks with *In Dubious Battle*:  \n\n> We got the sole reprint rights before GRAPES OF WRATH leaped to best-sellerdom and very lucky, too, for I am convinced it would have been more advantageous to the Viking crowd to have given the book to Grosset as well as to us. We would in that case have shared the market and perhaps not a big share either. If Grosset had IN DUBIOUS BATTLE they would get an advance of 20,000 to 25,000 copies, in my judgment. We are looking for an 8,000 to 10,000 advance on the strength of the fact that this brand new army of Steinbeck readers is now wide open for his past work. Every bookstore you call on has sold good quantities of GRAPES OF WRATH and that’s the market for IN DUBIOUS BATTLE. . . . Remember that IN DUBIOUS BATTLE does not take up much room and you have got to get at least a 25-stack if you expect the public to see it. We want 25’s, 50’s and 100’s. If a dealer buries this title on a shelf in 1’s and 2’s, we are licked before we start. (RH Box 153, Sales folder)  \n\nThe ML distributed a four-color display poster to bookstores that described *In Dubious Battle* as “a long, full, satisfying novel that deals with the same kind of characters and the same background as THE GRAPES OF WRATH” and launched a \\$7,500 advertising campaign that featured *In Dubious Battle* along with Steinbeck’s other ML titles, *Tortilla Flat* and *Of Mice and Men* (*PW*, 5 August 1939, p. 351).
