<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
To bring within the compass of one volume the best of the essays
written by Michel de Montaigne in a translation that is both faithful
and modern has long been the aim of the editors of this series. The
existing English renderings are either so archaic or are sometimes so
colloquial as to lose some of the original nuances of meaning.
Accordingly, with the William Hazlitt [Charles Cotton–W. C. Hazlitt]
translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of
Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and
modernized collection in language that retains the substance and
conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay
form. (<em>Fall 1949; [Spring 1956]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published
fall 1949. <em>WR</em> 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Montaigne’s <em>Essays</em> had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first
in the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford
University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation,
and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was
exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to
think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates
as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright
protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and
quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947).
He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern
Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged.
The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced
it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United
States. Because there was some question of British rights, we
voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search
of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only
available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four
volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and
comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29
September 1947).</p>
<p>Bates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century
translation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the
public domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or
readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the
Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at
least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The
contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely
to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you
deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the
original and to give the best possible modern rendering.”</p>
<p>Bates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt
translation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the
Editor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised
it, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to
the accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to
modernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the
translation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text
stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do
considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]). Bates did not
consider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement
“completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of
the title page be omitted.</p>
<p>The manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have
been delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his
editorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.</p>
<p>Bates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included
the essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion
of sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain
in language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one
of the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and
quotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed.
If you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to
Commins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in
fact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or,
if included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).</p>

<p>In 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern
Library College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a
list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently
cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not
include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the
near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College
Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year
as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be
incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to
Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.</p>
<p>Stein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously
bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML
consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s
translation of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,
Letters</em> (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably
the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3
November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.
If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition
of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Essays</em> in 1958, may
not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.</p>

First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nMontaigne’s *Essays* had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first\nin the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford\nUniversity Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation,\nand the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was\nexhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to\nthink about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates\nas editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright\nprotection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and\nquite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947).\nHe then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern\nLibrary Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged.\nThe archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced\nit with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United\nStates. Because there was some question of British rights, we\nvoluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search\nof a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only\navailable ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four\nvolumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and\ncomparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29\nSeptember 1947).\n\nBates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century\ntranslation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the\npublic domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or\nreadability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the\nHazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at\nleast a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The\ncontract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely\nto Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you\ndeem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the\noriginal and to give the best possible modern rendering.”\n\nBates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt\ntranslation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the\nEditor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised\nit, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to\nthe accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to\nmodernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the\ntranslation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text\nstand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do\nconsiderable revising of the translation” (p. \\[vii\\]). Bates did not\nconsider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement\n“completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of\nthe title page be omitted.\n\nThe manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have\nbeen delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his\neditorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.\n\nBates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included\nthe essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion\nof sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain\nin language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one\nof the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and\nquotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed.\nIf you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to\nCommins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in\nfact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or,\nif included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).\n\n#### 419b.

Projections for MLCE were subsequently\ncut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not\ninclude the publication of this book in the College Editions within the\nnear future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College\nEditions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year\nas we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be\nincorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to\nBates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.\n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously\nbad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML\nconsider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s\ntranslation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,\nLetters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably\nthe definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3\nNovember 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.\nIf he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition\nof Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s *Complete Essays* in 1958, may\nnot have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Florio translation (1933–1945) G10.1\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Trechmann translation (1946–1948) G10.2",
