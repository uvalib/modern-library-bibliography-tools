<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
A merciless and absorbing story, <em>The Lost Weekend</em> has become for the
victim of alcoholism what De Quincey’s <em>The Confessions of an English
Opium Eater</em> has been for the drug addict. It is a psychological study
which moves with relentless speed and heartbreaking truth to its
inevitable end. As drama it is tense, as a case history it is
painfully accurate, as a search into the depths of the alcoholic’s
mind it is terrifying. Yet as a novel it has a sobriety of purpose and
a steadiness of skill attained by few writers of our time. (<em>Spring
1948</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1944. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–244) printed from Rinehart plates; to accommodate the plates the
ML edition was 3/16 inch taller and ⅛ inch wider than the ML’s standard
format. Published spring 1948. <em>WR</em> 29 May 1948. First (and only)
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of <em>The Lost Weekend</em> in 1945,
but the original edition was still selling well and Farrar &amp; Rinehart
ruled out any reprint edition until after Billy Wilder’s forthcoming
motion picture version starring Ray Milland and Jane Wyman had run its
course. After the ML’s offer had been rejected Jackson wrote Cerf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you will understand . . . how disappointed I am, because it
seems to me that being chosen by the Modern Library is the nearest
American equivalent to “immortality,” if I may use such a fancy word.
If THE LOST WEEKEND should be able to hold your interest a few years
from now, I hope you will “tap” me then for your society. Nothing
could make me prouder or happier, as I believe you know already
(Jackson to Cerf, 17 July 1945).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerf replied that he hoped the ML edition could be published in late
1946 or early 1947 (Cerf to Jackson, 20 July 1945). In 1946 he announced
that <em>The Lost Weekend</em> was “ticketed for a permanent place in the
Modern Library, but the date is still highly uncertain” (“Trade Winds,”
<em>SRL</em>, 2 February 1946, p. 18).</p>
<p>Sales of the ML edition were disappointing. <em>The Lost Weekend</em> was
dropped from the series after two and a half years, making it one of the
ML’s shortest-lived title<s>s</s>. The only title that had a shorter
tenure was Irving Fineman’s <em>Hear, Ye Sons</em> (1939), which lasted in the
series for twenty-six months.</p>

Statement on\nfront: “Five days out of a man’s life—one of the strangest, most\nremarkable narratives ever written.”\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> A merciless and absorbing story, *The Lost Weekend* has become for the\n> victim of alcoholism what De Quincey’s *The Confessions of an English\n> Opium Eater* has been for the drug addict. It is a psychological study\n> which moves with relentless speed and heartbreaking truth to its\n> inevitable end. As drama it is tense, as a case history it is\n> painfully accurate, as a search into the depths of the alcoholic’s\n> mind it is terrifying. Yet as a novel it has a sobriety of purpose and\n> a steadiness of skill attained by few writers of our time. (*Spring\n> 1948*)\n\nOriginally published by Farrar & Rinehart, 1944. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–244) printed from Rinehart plates; to accommodate the plates the\nML edition was 3/16 inch taller and ⅛ inch wider than the ML’s standard\nformat. Published spring 1948. *WR* 29 May 1948. First (and only)\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.\n\nCerf expressed interest in a ML edition of *The Lost Weekend* in 1945,\nbut the original edition was still selling well and Farrar & Rinehart\nruled out any reprint edition until after Billy Wilder’s forthcoming\nmotion picture version starring Ray Milland and Jane Wyman had run its\ncourse. After the ML’s offer had been rejected Jackson wrote Cerf:\n\n> I hope you will understand . . . how disappointed I am, because it\n> seems to me that being chosen by the Modern Library is the nearest\n> American equivalent to “immortality,” if I may use such a fancy word.\n> If THE LOST WEEKEND should be able to hold your interest a few years\n> from now, I hope you will “tap” me then for your society. Nothing\n> could make me prouder or happier, as I believe you know already\n> (Jackson to Cerf, 17 July 1945).\n\nCerf replied that he hoped the ML edition could be published in late\n1946 or early 1947 (Cerf to Jackson, 20 July 1945). In 1946 he announced\nthat *The Lost Weekend* was “ticketed for a permanent place in the\nModern Library, but the date is still highly uncertain” (“Trade Winds,”\n*SRL*, 2 February 1946, p. 18).\n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *The Lost Weekend* was\ndropped from the series after two and a half years, making it one of the\nML’s shortest-lived title<s>s</s>. The only title that had a shorter\ntenure was Irving Fineman’s *Hear, Ye Sons* (1939), which lasted in the\nseries for twenty-six months.",
