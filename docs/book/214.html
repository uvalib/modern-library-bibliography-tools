<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in moderate green (145) and black on cream paper

lettering in black. Signed: L. Trevisan. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Katherine Mansfield’s sharp perceptions of significant detail, her
vivid strokes of characterization and her ability so sensitively to
merge reality with unreality give to her short stories the qualities
of a remembered experience rather than those of a tale merely well
told. In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her
spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose
of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for
truth so evident in her life and work. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–255) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1931. <em>WR</em> 2 May
1931. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint
contract with Knopf in October 1929 for <em>The Dove’s Nest</em>, paying a $500
advance. <em>The Garden Party</em> was not considered because an inexpensive
reprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML
bought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to
cancel the contract for <em>The Dove’s Nest</em> so that the ML could include
the more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against
royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The
royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when
the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June
1947).</p>
<p><em>The Garden Party</em> had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There
were printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938,
1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an
additional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies
during the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June
1938). <em>The Garden Party</em> sold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles.
It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern
Library during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her\n> spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose\n> of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for\n> truth so evident in her life and work. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–255) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1931. *WR* 2 May\n1931. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint\ncontract with Knopf in October 1929 for *The Dove’s Nest*, paying a $500\nadvance. *The Garden Party* was not considered because an inexpensive\nreprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML\nbought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to\ncancel the contract for *The Dove’s Nest* so that the ML could include\nthe more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The\nroyalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when\nthe ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June\n1947).\n\n*The Garden Party* had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There\nwere printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938,\n1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an\nadditional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies\nduring the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C.
