<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The play, based on Erskine Caldwell’s novel, <em>Tobacco Road</em>, was the
most phenomenally successful production in the history of the American
theatre. The novel itself has been one of the most widely read and
discussed books of our time. Whatever controversies it has aroused,
there has been no difference of opinion about its power and
excitement. As the chronicler of the folkways of the impoverished
South, Erskine Caldwell has re-created a world and a people with
courageous realism. He has given us, in <em>Tobacco Road</em>, a novel of
extraordinary appeal and merit. (<em>Spring 1947</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
<em>Tobacco Road</em> is one of the most widely read and discussed books of
our time. Brilliantly realistic in its picture of moral and physical
decay among the impoverished sharecroppers and tenant farmers of the
South, this novel has been universally acclaimed for its high literary
merit and for its socially significant viewpoint. Throughout the book
there runs a skillfully drawn thread of rich humor, imparting to the
reader a sympathetic understanding of the shocking state in which many
Americans still live.</p>
<p>Erskine Caldwell has long been regarded as one of our foremost
writers, and most readers would give <em>Tobacco Road</em> a prominent place
in the list of his writings. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1932; rights
subsequently transferred to Duell, Sloan and Pearce. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–241) printed from Scribner/Duell, Sloan and Pearce plates except
for “After Ten Years” (pp. [<em>7–9</em>]) which was not in Scribner
printings. Publication announced for February 1947. <em>WR</em> 17 May 1947.
First printing: Not established. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The reprint agreement for the ML edition was signed in May 1945 with
publication scheduled for spring 1947 (Cerf to Charles Duell, 20
September 1946). The contract for the ML edition of Howard Fast’s <em>The
Unvanquished</em> (379), which appeared in fall 1945, was signed at the same
time. Details are not available about the advance paid by the ML or the
initial royalty rate; in the 1960s the ML was paying royalties of 15
cents a copy.</p>
<p>Caldwell’s preface “After Ten Years” originally appeared in the 1940
edition published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce with black-and-white
illustrations by David Fredenthal.</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted
that the retail price of ML books had increased since 1947 and inquired
whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown,
17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12
cents a copy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
At the time of its publication in 1932, <em>Tobacco Road</em> aroused
excitement and indignation with its grim picture of poverty, ignorance
and moral degeneracy in a Southern poor white family. One of the first
of the realistic novels of the Depression, it was among the most
controversial. Profoundly influential in its time—both artistically
and socially—<em>Tobacco Road</em> remains a landmark of American literature.</p>
