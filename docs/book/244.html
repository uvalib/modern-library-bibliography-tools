<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The perpetual enchantment and all the magical and multi-colored
pageantry of <em>The Arabian Nights</em> are offered here in Sir Richard
Burton’s rendering for the delectation of adult minds. Shahrazad spins
her tales without censorial interruption, and the spell that possessed
King Shahryar and since then has possessed mankind is not broken,
praise be to Allah, by discreet asterisks and decorous euphemisms. The
tales in this volume were chosen because they are the most fascinating
and representative of <em>The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night</em>.
(<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML selection. Published September 1932. <em>WR</em> 15 October 1932.
First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The title page of <em>The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments</em> had so much text
that there was no room for the torchbearer or for Cerf and Klopfer’s
names in the imprint.</p>
<p>Cerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on
the title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not
strictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation
of “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and
unabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the
stories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional
phrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I
believe it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”
(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce &amp; Co., 16 November 1932). The ML
made three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to
Walter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the
book for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in
September 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition
in November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset &amp; Dunlap
borrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,
paying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy
(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 28 May 1937).</p>
<p><em>The Arabian Nights</em> sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and
Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling ML titles in
the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952.</p>

The\n> tales in this volume were chosen because they are the most fascinating\n> and representative of *The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night*.\n> (*Fall 1937*)\n\nOriginal ML selection. Published September 1932. *WR* 15 October 1932.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text\nthat there was no room for the torchbearer or for Cerf and Klopfer’s\nnames in the imprint.\n\nCerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on\nthe title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not\nstrictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation\nof “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and\nunabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the\nstories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional\nphrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I\nbelieve it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”\n(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML\nmade three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to\nWalter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the\nbook for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in\nSeptember 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition\nin November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap\nborrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,\npaying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).\n\n*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The perpetual enchantment and all the magical and multi-colored\n> pageantry of *The Arabian Nights* are offered here in Sir Richard\n> Burton’s rendering for the delectation of adult minds. Shahrazad spins\n> her tales without censorial interruption, and the spell that possessed\n> King Shahryar and since then has possessed mankind is not broken,\n> praise be to Allah, by discreet asterisks and decorous euphemisms. The\n> tales in this volume were chosen because they are the most fascinating\n> and representative of *The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night*.\n> (*Fall 1937*)\n\nOriginal ML selection. Published September 1932. *WR* 15 October 1932.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text\nthat there was no room for the torchbearer or for Cerf and Klopfer’s\nnames in the imprint.\n\nCerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on\nthe title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not\nstrictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation\nof “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and\nunabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the\nstories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional\nphrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I\nbelieve it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”\n(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML\nmade three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to\nWalter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the\nbook for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in\nSeptember 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition\nin November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap\nborrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,\npaying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).\n\n*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling ML titles in\nthe regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952.\n\n"
