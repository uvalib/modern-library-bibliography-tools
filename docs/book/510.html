<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the great modern poets, no one is held in greater esteem than W. H.
Auden. In the opinion of many, he is regarded as the foremost poet of
our time.</p>
<p>It is with particular pride, therefore, that the publishers of the
Modern Library make this book available to the large number of readers
who have long wished for such a volume.</p>
<p>This book contains a generous selection of Auden’s poetry. Here the
reader will find constant enjoyment in the spirited wit, the
wide-ranging intellect, the emotional power, and the unsurpassed
artistry that are among Auden’s characteristics. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in Britain as <em>W. H. Auden: A Selection by the
Author</em> (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from
a new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. <em>WR</em> 23 February 1959.
First printing: 7,500 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for
the ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of
<em>The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden</em> which Random House published in
1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer
turned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in
Vintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback
edition because <em>Collected Poetry</em> was selling so well (Klopfer to
Alfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).</p>
<p>The ML reprinted <em>W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author</em> because Auden
did not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered
buying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S.
copyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been
set in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention,
which the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement
for works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S.
citizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer
wrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might
invalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance”
(Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set
of proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of
uncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the
Penguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7
July 1958).</p>
<p>Auden included the following note on p. [<em>8</em>] following the table of
contents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the
chronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the
last from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony
or sense or both”.</p>
<p>The ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson
report a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings
of 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two
printings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and
7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969).</p>

reset. Published in Vintage Books, November 1971; ML edition probably
appeared a few months later. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not
ascertained.</p>
<p>Auden sent Epstein a list of poems to be added in the second edition. He
later requested that the author’s note (510a, p. [<em>8</em>]) be deleted
from the second edition (Pohoryles memo to Joan Milarsky, 29 April
1971). Epstein indicated that the second edition should be out in a
Vintage paperback in September and the regular ML by early 1972 (Epstein
to Auden, 28 January 1971). Auden received a $2,000 advance against
royalties of 5 percent of the retail price for the ML edition and 7½
percent of the retail price for the Vintage Books edition (contract
dated 16 February 1971).</p>

In the opinion of many, he is regarded as the foremost poet of\n> our time.\n>\n> It is with particular pride, therefore, that the publishers of the\n> Modern Library make this book available to the large number of readers\n> who have long wished for such a volume.\n>\n> This book contains a generous selection of Auden’s poetry. Here the\n> reader will find constant enjoyment in the spirited wit, the\n> wide-ranging intellect, the emotional power, and the unsurpassed\n> artistry that are among Auden’s characteristics. (*Spring 1959*)\n\nOriginally published in Britain as *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the\nAuthor* (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from\na new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. *WR* 23 February 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500 copies.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for\nthe ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of\n*The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden* which Random House published in\n1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer\nturned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in\nVintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback\nedition because *Collected Poetry* was selling so well (Klopfer to\nAlfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).\n\nThe ML reprinted *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* because Auden\ndid not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered\nbuying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S.\ncopyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been\nset in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention,\nwhich the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement\nfor works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S.\ncitizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer\nwrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might\ninvalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance”\n(Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set\nof proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of\nuncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the\nPenguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7\nJuly 1958).\n\nAuden included the following note on p. \\[*8*\\] following the table of\ncontents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the\nchronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the\nlast from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony\nor sense or both”.\n\nThe ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson\nreport a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings\nof 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two\nprintings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and\n7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969).\n\n#### 510b.

He\nlater requested that the author’s note (510a, p. \\[*8*\\]) be deleted\nfrom the second edition (Pohoryles memo to Joan Milarsky, 29 April\n1971). Epstein indicated that the second edition should be out in a\nVintage paperback in September and the regular ML by early 1972 (Epstein\nto Auden, 28 January 1971). Auden received a $2,000 advance against\nroyalties of 5 percent of the retail price for the ML edition and 7½\npercent of the retail price for the Vintage Books edition (contract\ndated 16 February 1971).\n\nPublished at $2.95.
