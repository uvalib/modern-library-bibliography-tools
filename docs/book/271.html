<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
By now the fretful babblings of the prurient over the amatory
excursions of Messire Jurgen have subsided. Instead of bothering to
discover phallic parables in every casual allusion, adult readers take
the keenest delight in the nimble satire of this morality in behalf of
monogamy and common-sense. <em>Jurgen</em>, thanks to the obscenity seekers,
has become Cabell’s best-known novel. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Robert M. McBride &amp; Co., 1919. ML edition (pp.
[iii–iv], [xiii]–368) printed from McBride plates with the expanded
foreword first included in the eighth McBride printing. Published July
1934. <em>WR</em> 28 July 1934. Discontinued fall 1943.</p>
<p><em>Jurgen</em> was one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure
after they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a
$5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice
he offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’s <em>Cream of the Jest</em> or
<em>The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck</em> (Cerf to Mr. [Guy] Holt, McBride, 29
July 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition of <em>Beyond Life</em> (104)
two years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint
editions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained
strong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition
of Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).</p>
<p>McBride authorized a ML edition of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> (131) in
1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer for <em>Jurgen</em>, but
the response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12
cents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to
permit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least
for the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and
particularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so
profitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way –
this despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the
sale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer
to Rose, 27 March 1928).</p>
<p>Grosset &amp; Dunlap published a reprint edition of <em>Jurgen</em> in its Novels
of Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in
publishing <em>Jurgen</em> in the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker,
McBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed
when the Grosset &amp; Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months
later, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we
can get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset &amp;
Dunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset &amp; Dunlap wrote
McBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t
directly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset &amp; Dunlap to McBride
&amp; Co., 16 November 1933).</p>

ML edition (pp.\n\\[iii–iv\\], \\[xiii\\]–368) printed from McBride plates with the expanded\nforeword first included in the eighth McBride printing. Published July\n1934. *WR* 28 July 1934. Discontinued fall 1943.\n\n*Jurgen* was one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure\nafter they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a\n$5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice\nhe offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’s *Cream of the Jest* or\n*The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck* (Cerf to Mr. \\[Guy\\] Holt, McBride, 29\nJuly 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition of *Beyond Life* (104)\ntwo years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint\neditions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained\nstrong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition\nof Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).\n\nMcBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* (131) in\n1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer for *Jurgen*, but\nthe response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12\ncents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to\npermit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least\nfor the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and\nparticularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so\nprofitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way –\nthis despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the\nsale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer\nto Rose, 27 March 1928).\n\nGrosset & Dunlap published a reprint edition of *Jurgen* in its Novels\nof Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in\npublishing *Jurgen* in the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker,\nMcBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed\nwhen the Grosset & Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months\nlater, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we\ncan get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset &\nDunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset & Dunlap wrote\nMcBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t\ndirectly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset & Dunlap to McBride\n& Co., 16 November 1933).\n\n#### 271b.
