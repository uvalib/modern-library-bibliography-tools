cream—almost pale orange yellow (73)—paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The nationwide revival of interest in the writings of Henry James has
created the demand for this new, popular-priced edition of <em>The Wings
of the Dove</em>. Considered by its author the most ambitious, by his
critics the most perceptive and by his ever-growing circle of devotees
his most highly sustained novel, it is given a distinguished place in
the Modern Library series beside two of his widely read works: <em>The
Portrait of a Lady</em>, Number 107, and <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>, Number
169. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>B:</em> As 389.1 except deep reddish brown (41) in place of dark
red and pale yellow (89) in place of yellowish gray on coated cream
paper. (<em>Fall 1964</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in two volumes by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1902. ML
edition (381.1, pp. [1]–329; [1]–439) printed from Scribner plates
in a single volume with title retained in the heading of v. 1, p. 3 and
removed from the heading of vol. 2, p. 3; “Preface” printed from a new
typesetting. Publication announced for September 1946. <em>WR</em> 16 November
1946. First printing: Not ascertained but probably 5,000 copies.
Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The ML paid Scribner’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a
copy. The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the
assumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML that <em>The Wings of
the Dove</em> did not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve
large reprint sales.</p>
<p>James’s Preface (pp. v–xxii) originally appeared in the New York Edition
of <em>The Novels and Tales of Henry James</em> (New York: Charles Scribner’s
Sons, 1907–17), in which <em>The Wings of the Dove</em> occupied vols. 19–20.
The New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type.
The ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s
edition and made plates that were used for ML printings.</p>
<p>Four years before <em>The Wings of the Dove</em> was added to the ML, Cerf
admitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf
to Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote,
“According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a
motion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the
Dove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make
a timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report,
however, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is
one of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than
Faulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political
dissertations” (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, June 20, 1942, p. 20).</p>
<p><em>The Wings of the Dove</em> was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1952–October 1952. In
contrast, James’s <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> (1936) was solidly in the first
quarter of ML titles, and <em>Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master</em>
(1930) was near the top of the second quarter.</p>

(*Spring 1957 jacket*) *Note:*\n> Battered page numeral “329” removed from plates.\n\n*Jacket* *A:* Non-pictorial with lettering in dark red (16) and black on\ninset yellowish gray (93) panel within dark red frame, all on\ncream—almost pale orange yellow (73)—paper.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The nationwide revival of interest in the writings of Henry James has\n> created the demand for this new, popular-priced edition of *The Wings\n> of the Dove*. Considered by its author the most ambitious, by his\n> critics the most perceptive and by his ever-growing circle of devotees\n> his most highly sustained novel, it is given a distinguished place in\n> the Modern Library series beside two of his widely read works: *The\n> Portrait of a Lady*, Number 107, and *The Turn of the Screw*, Number\n> 169. (*Fall 1946*)\n\n*Jacket* *B:* As 389.1 except deep reddish brown (41) in place of dark\nred and pale yellow (89) in place of yellowish gray on coated cream\npaper. (*Fall 1964*)\n\nOriginally published in two volumes by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1902. ML\nedition (381.1, pp. \\[1\\]–329; \\[1\\]–439) printed from Scribner plates\nin a single volume with title retained in the heading of v. 1, p. 3 and\nremoved from the heading of vol. 2, p. 3; “Preface” printed from a new\ntypesetting. Publication announced for September 1946. *WR* 16 November\n1946. First printing: Not ascertained but probably 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1969/70.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a\ncopy. The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the\nassumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML that *The Wings of\nthe Dove* did not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve\nlarge reprint sales.\n\nJames’s Preface (pp. v–xxii) originally appeared in the New York Edition\nof *The Novels and Tales of Henry James* (New York: Charles Scribner’s\nSons, 1907–17), in which *The Wings of the Dove* occupied vols. 19–20.\nThe New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type.\nThe ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s\nedition and made plates that were used for ML printings.\n\nFour years before *The Wings of the Dove* was added to the ML, Cerf\nadmitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf\nto Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote,\n“According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a\nmotion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the\nDove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make\na timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report,\nhowever, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is\none of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than\nFaulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political\ndissertations” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, June 20, 1942, p. 20).\n\n*The Wings of the Dove* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the 12-month period, November 1952–October 1952. In\ncontrast, James’s *Portrait of a Lady* (1936) was solidly in the first\nquarter of ML titles, and *Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master*\n(1930) was near the top of the second quarter.",
