<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Samuel Hoffenstein practices in the tradition of sparkling light verse
that has become one of the most refreshing trends on the American
literary scene. And even in that tradition he is unique, as evidenced
by the constantly increasing corps of Hoffenstein devotees. In this
book, to their infinite joy and that of the hosts of newcomers who
will join their ranks upon its publication, the Modern Library
presents the complete Hoffenstein to date, the full texts of his three
volumes—<em>Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing, Year In, You’re Out,</em>
and <em>Pencil in the Air</em>. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing</em> originally published by Boni &amp;
Liveright, 1928; <em>Year In, You’re Out</em> originally published by Horace
Liveright, 1930; <em>Pencil in the Air</em> originally published by Doubleday &amp;
Co., 1947. Original ML collection printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published May 1954. <em>WR</em> 29 May 1954. First (and only)
printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.</p>
<p>The ML paid a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.
Rights to <em>Pencil in the Air</em> had reverted to Hoffenstein’s estate, and
the advance was divided equally between Liveright and David Hoffenstein,
the author’s son. The ML edition sold about 6,000 copies in four and a
half years (David Hoffenstein to Cerf, 9 December 1958). When the ML
edition was discontinued Cerf wrote to David Hoffenstein, “I am sorry to
say that we cannot possibly keep the Hoffenstein Poetry in the Modern
Library. Quite frankly, it was one of the very poorest sellers we have
ever had in the series. I am just as sorry about this as I know you are”
(Cerf to David Hoffenstein, 23 December 1958).</p>
