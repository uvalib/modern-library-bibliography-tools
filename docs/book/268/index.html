text; [304] blank; [305–311] APPENDIX | TO THE FIFTH PRINTING;
[312] blank; [313–318] ML list. (<em>Spring 1934</em>) <em>Note:</em> The fourth
leaf of the first gathering (pp. vii–viii) has been cancelled and
replaced by a newly printed leaf; the first gathering is normal in later
printings. It is not known whether the original leaf was cancelled
because of a printer’s error or a last-minute revision by Caldwell.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in vivid orange (48), moderate green (145) and dark
grayish brown (62) on cream paper depicting vivid orange sun rising over
moderate green fields; borders in vivid orange, title in reverse on
three moderate green banners, other lettering in dark grayish brown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
When the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, through its
agent, John S. Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of <em>God’s
Little Acre</em> on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and
women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin
Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case,
declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.”
The Modern Library now adds <em>God’s Little Acre</em> to its list as a
serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp.
[v], [1]–[311]) printed from Viking plates, which were
subsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown &amp; Co.
Published April 1934. <em>WR</em> 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies.
Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Caldwell received $50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf
to Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have
the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have
mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly
trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and
girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee
winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills
of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them.
I hope so. (p. ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition
was realized most fully after the introduction of mass market
paperbacks. The paperback edition of <em>God’s Little Acre</em>, published in
1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by
Penguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its
first nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern
paperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million
copies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).</p>
<p>The biographical note and bibliography on p. [vi] were updated at
Caldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27
December 1938). The plates and publishing rights to <em>God’s Little Acre</em>
were transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall
1939 and passed to Little, Brown &amp; Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged
its printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one
printing under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted
that the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934
and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill,
Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying
royalties of 12 cents a copy.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total
sales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to
James Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).</p>

(*Spring 1934*) *Note:* The fourth\nleaf of the first gathering (pp. vii–viii) has been cancelled and\nreplaced by a newly printed leaf; the first gathering is normal in later\nprintings. It is not known whether the original leaf was cancelled\nbecause of a printer’s error or a last-minute revision by Caldwell.\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in vivid orange (48), moderate green (145) and dark\ngrayish brown (62) on cream paper depicting vivid orange sun rising over\nmoderate green fields; borders in vivid orange, title in reverse on\nthree moderate green banners, other lettering in dark grayish brown.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> When the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, through its\n> agent, John S. Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of *God’s\n> Little Acre* on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and\n> women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin\n> Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case,\n> declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.”\n> The Modern Library now adds *God’s Little Acre* to its list as a\n> serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp.\n\\[v\\], \\[1\\]–\\[311\\]) printed from Viking plates, which were\nsubsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown & Co.\nPublished April 1934. *WR* 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1970/71.\n\nCaldwell received $50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf\nto Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:\n\n> Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have\n> the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have\n> mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly\n> trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and\n> girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee\n> winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills\n> of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them.\n> I hope so. (p. ix)\n\nThe hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition\nwas realized most fully after the introduction of mass market\npaperbacks. The paperback edition of *God’s Little Acre*, published in\n1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by\nPenguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its\nfirst nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern\npaperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million\ncopies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).\n\nThe biographical note and bibliography on p. \\[vi\\] were updated at\nCaldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27\nDecember 1938). The plates and publishing rights to *God’s Little Acre*\nwere transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall\n1939 and passed to Little, Brown & Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged\nits printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one\nprinting under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted\nthat the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934\nand inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill,\nLittle, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying\nroyalties of 12 cents a copy.\n\nThe ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total\nsales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to\nJames Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).\n\n#### 268.1b.
