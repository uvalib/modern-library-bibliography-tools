<p><strong>NIKOLAI GOGOL. DEAD SOULS. 1936–1971. (ML 40)</strong></p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in strong purplish blue (196) and black on light yellowish brown paper with inset illustration of a Russian official holding a notebook and addressing a man with bowed head; borders in strong purplish blue, title in reverse against illustration, other lettering in black.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> It is almost a hundred years since <em>Dead Souls</em> was written. During that time it has made a permanent place for itself in the world’s literature beside such books as <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> and <em>Don Quixote</em>. To the Russian, whatever his political allegiance may be, <em>Dead Souls</em> is more than a satire that flays the weakness of the Slavic character; it is the enduring symbol of a people that neither tyranny nor revolution can change. Gogol’s masterpiece lends new distinction to the Modern Library list. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Constance Garnett translation originally published in U.S. as vols. 1–2 of <em>The Collected Works of Nikolay Gogol</em> by Alfred A. Knopf, 1923. ML edition (290.1, pp. [7]–275; [5]–265) printed from Knopf plates with page numerals removed from translator’s preface. Published March 1936. <em>WR</em> 28 March 1936. First printing: 5,000 copies. Superseded 1965 by Guerney translation (290.2).</p>
<p>Herschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt &amp; Co., asked in 1931 why <em>Dead Souls</em> wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead Souls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to it. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf, undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). The ML edition was published five years later.</p>
<p>The ML edition (290.1) was translated by Constance Garnett. Garnett was named on the title page of other classics of Russian literature published in the ML before the 1960s. The only clue to the translator’s identity in <em>Dead Souls</em> is the copyright notice on the verso of the title page, where she is identified as “Mrs. Edward Garnett.” Odets received $50 for the introduction (Cerf to Odets, 16 January 1936).</p>
<p><em>Dead Souls</em> sold 3,557 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Since its publication in 1842 <em>Dead Souls</em> has made a permanent place for itself in the world’s literature beside such books as <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> and <em>Don Quixote</em>. Gogol’s epic laughter, his grotesque realism and relentless satire have created a triumphant masterpiece that is an enduring symbol of the Russian character.
Bernard Guilbert Guerney’s brilliant translation includes the seldom-printed second volume of <em>Dead Souls</em>, which Gogol left unfinished. Mr. Guerney has also provided notes, a glossary and an introduction.</p>

Signed: Cassens.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> It is almost a hundred years since *Dead Souls* was written. During that time it has made a permanent place for itself in the world’s literature beside such books as *Gulliver’s Travels* and *Don Quixote*. To the Russian, whatever his political allegiance may be, *Dead Souls* is more than a satire that flays the weakness of the Slavic character; it is the enduring symbol of a people that neither tyranny nor revolution can change. Gogol’s masterpiece lends new distinction to the Modern Library list. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nConstance Garnett translation originally published in U.S. as vols. 1–2 of *The Collected Works of Nikolay Gogol* by Alfred A. Knopf, 1923. ML edition (290.1, pp. [7]–275; [5]–265) printed from Knopf plates with page numerals removed from translator’s preface. Published March 1936. *WR* 28 March 1936. First printing: 5,000 copies. Superseded 1965 by Guerney translation (290.2).  \n\nHerschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co., asked in 1931 why *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead Souls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to it. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf, undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). The ML edition was published five years later.  \n\nThe ML edition (290.1) was translated by Constance Garnett. Garnett was named on the title page of other classics of Russian literature published in the ML before the 1960s. The only clue to the translator’s identity in *Dead Souls* is the copyright notice on the verso of the title page, where she is identified as “Mrs. Edward Garnett.” Odets received \\$50 for the introduction (Cerf to Odets, 16 January 1936).  \n\n*Dead Souls* sold 3,557 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 290.1b.

Mr. Guerney has also provided notes, a glossary and an introduction.  \n\nGuerney translation originally published by the Readers Club, 1942, and Limited Editions Club, 1944.
