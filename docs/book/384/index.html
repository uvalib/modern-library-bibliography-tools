1946–1970. (ML 243)</strong></p>
<h4>384. First printing (1946)</h4>
<p>THE | CONFESSIONS | OF | JEAN JACQUES | ROUSSEAU | [torchbearer D5] |
[rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | [rule]</p>
<p>Pp. [i–iv] v–xviii, [1–2] 3–683 [684–686]. [1–22]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] FIRST MODERN
LIBRARY EDITION, 1945; v–xviii CONTENTS; [1] fly title; [2] blank;
3–683 text; [684–686] blank. <em>Note:</em> Publication appears to have been

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial on cream paper in moderate brown (58), dark bluish
green (165), and black, with inset illustration by Hugo Steiner-Prag of
a small figure seated by a lake with mountains in the distance and three
trees in the foreground, all in moderate brown with dark bluish green

bluish green and black, all within black and dark bluish green rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For almost two hundred years <em>The Confessions of Jean Jacques
Rousseau</em> has remained unchallenged as the classic book of
self-revelation. A tremendous influence on subsequent writing, it is
as meaningful for our generation as it was before, during and
immediately after the French Revolution. The very voice of the
enlightenment, it speaks with the same eloquence for every enlightened
reader today. The inclusion of <em>The Confessions</em>, complete and
unabridged, in the Modern Library series fulfills a long-cherished
plan of the editors. (<em>Spring 1946</em>) <em>Note:</em> The jacket illustration
is credited to Steiner-Prag on the front flap; Joseph Blumenthal was
responsible for the typographic design. (<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML did not know the identity of the translator. ML edition printed
from plates made from a new typesetting. Scheduled for fall 1945;
published February 1946. <em>WR</em> 9 February 1946. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p><em>The Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau</em> was scheduled for publication
in fall 1945, and the verso of the title page of the first printing
states “FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION, 1945.” However, its listing in
<em>Publishers’ Weekly</em>’s “Weekly Record” of newly published books is in
the issue for 9 February 1946, and there is a spring 1946 list of ML
titles inside the first printing of the jacket. Publication may have
been delayed by the wave of strikes that accompanied the return to a
peacetime economy (<em>see</em> Neavill, “Publishing in Wartime,” <em>Library
Trends</em> 55 [Winter 2007], p. 593;
<a href="http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/slisfrp/62">http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/slisfrp/62</a>). Klopfer remarked later in
1946, “We are having the usual hellish time getting our books out and
the situation amongst the suppliers is certainly no easier than it was
at any time during the war” (Klopfer to Cerf, 14 August 1946).</p>
<p>The ML edition was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. Sales
totaled 45,924 copies by spring 1958.</p>
