<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Who can withhold a tear for Cyrano de Bergerac as he hides his
preposterous nose in the darkness and lets his lyric utterances win
the fair Roxane for the handsome but mute Christian de Neuvillette?
Who has not been moved to pity by the romantic posturings of the
unerring swordsman, this understudy knight of chivalry and
ghost-writing maker of sonorous ballades? All the fine bravura of
Edmond Rostand’s swaggering drama, all its poetical extravagance and
glamor are here in Brian Hooker’s famous translation. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hooker translation originally published by Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1923. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March
1929. <em>WR</em> 27 April 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1973/74.</p>
<p>The Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the
text and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of
10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new
plates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first
30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a $3,400 advance in December 1928
against royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.</p>
<p>In 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of <em>Cyrano de
Bergerac</em> at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the
president of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed
concern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but
he acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely
putting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your
mind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at
high schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have
proposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on
your own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18
June 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).</p>
<p><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during
the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth
best-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October
1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose
Ferrer.</p>

<p>Jacques Le Clercq, whose translations of Rabelais’s <em>Gargantua and
Pantagruel</em> (G66) and Dumas’s <em>Three Musketeers</em> (153.2) were published
in the ML in 1944 and 1950, indicated in 1953 that he was working a
rhymed verse translation of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> and inquired if the ML
would be interested in it. He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is
superb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though
a perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was
inherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider
changing the translation, which had “established itself as standard for
many college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953;
Commins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton
University Library). Le Clercq’s translation of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>
does not appear to have been published.</p>
<p>By 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML
edition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep <em>Cyrano</em> in
the series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt
accept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new
plates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time
Holt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C.
Edwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May
1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the
mid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.</p>

All the fine bravura of\n> Edmond Rostand’s swaggering drama, all its poetical extravagance and\n> glamor are here in Brian Hooker’s famous translation. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nHooker translation originally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1923. ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March\n1929. *WR* 27 April 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1973/74.\n\nThe Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the\ntext and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of\n10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new\nplates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first\n30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a $3,400 advance in December 1928\nagainst royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.\n\nIn 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of *Cyrano de\nBergerac* at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the\npresident of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed\nconcern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but\nhe acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely\nputting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your\nmind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at\nhigh schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have\nproposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on\nyour own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18\nJune 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).\n\n*Cyrano de Bergerac* ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during\nthe 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth\nbest-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October\n1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose\nFerrer.\n\n#### 174.1b.

(*Spring 1956*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except strong purplish red (255) instead of\nvivid reddish orange. (*Spring 1963*)\n\nJacques Le Clercq, whose translations of Rabelais’s *Gargantua and\nPantagruel* (G66) and Dumas’s *Three Musketeers* (153.2) were published\nin the ML in 1944 and 1950, indicated in 1953 that he was working a\nrhymed verse translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac* and inquired if the ML\nwould be interested in it. He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is\nsuperb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though\na perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was\ninherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider\nchanging the translation, which had “established itself as standard for\nmany college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953;\nCommins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton\nUniversity Library). Le Clercq’s translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac*\ndoes not appear to have been published.\n\nBy 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML\nedition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep *Cyrano* in\nthe series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt\naccept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new\nplates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time\nHolt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C.\nEdwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May\n1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the\nmid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.",
