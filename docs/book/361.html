Controversies over the merits of favorite short stories are endless.
Everyone can argue at length over [±for] his own preferences [+and
find fault with every editor for his sins of omission]. The [±In our

<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em>, ed.
Grant Overton (188). Publication announced for February 1943. <em>WR</em> 7
August 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Cerf wrote in his foreword:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The compilation of a volume of Great Modern Stories for the Modern
Library was originally entrusted to the late Grant Overton in 1930.
This amiable gentleman brought around his list in due course, but was
far too good-natured and too gentle to hold out against the demands of
Donald Klopfer and myself. The eleven stories that were finally
included represented our own idea of a happy compromise: two of them
were Overton’s choice and nine of them were ours. Now Grant’s
remaining two have been scrapped, along with two of our own, and five
new ones substituted. I wish that Grant were here to forgive me. He
would say again, I know, “It’s your Library, boys; you know what you
want to put into it!”</p>
<p>Of the twelve stories in this new edition, my favorite four are “Heart
of Darkness,” “The Apple-Tree,” “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” and “The
Red Pony,” but the other eight are not far behind them. Anybody with a
pastepot and scissors can—and does—perpetrate anthologies today, but
I’d like to see anybody compile one that tops this collection in
quality! It has variety, balance, color and distinction. (pp.
vii–viii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML sold 12,699 copies of <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em> between 1 May
1942 and 1 November 1943; the total includes sales of Overton’s edition
(188) as well as Cerf’s.</p>

<p>Cerf noted in the new Foreword, “This collection has proven to be one of
the most successful and durable volumes in the Modern Library, its sales
increasing every year. The total is now over a million copies.
Furthermore, every one of the twelve stories has remained a favorite of
critics and the public alike. . . . I am proud, as its publisher, that
this anthology of truly great modern short stories has caught the fancy
of professors, students, and general bookstore patrons alike.” (p.

(*Fall 1963*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Great Modern Short Stories*, ed.\nGrant Overton (188). Publication announced for February 1943. *WR* 7\nAugust 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nCerf wrote in his foreword:\n\n> The compilation of a volume of Great Modern Stories for the Modern\n> Library was originally entrusted to the late Grant Overton in 1930.\n> This amiable gentleman brought around his list in due course, but was\n> far too good-natured and too gentle to hold out against the demands of\n> Donald Klopfer and myself. The eleven stories that were finally\n> included represented our own idea of a happy compromise: two of them\n> were Overton’s choice and nine of them were ours. Now Grant’s\n> remaining two have been scrapped, along with two of our own, and five\n> new ones substituted. I wish that Grant were here to forgive me. He\n> would say again, I know, “It’s your Library, boys; you know what you\n> want to put into it!”\n>\n> Of the twelve stories in this new edition, my favorite four are “Heart\n> of Darkness,” “The Apple-Tree,” “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” and “The\n> Red Pony,” but the other eight are not far behind them. Anybody with a\n> pastepot and scissors can—and does—perpetrate anthologies today, but\n> I’d like to see anybody compile one that tops this collection in\n> quality! It has variety, balance, color and distinction. (pp.\n> vii–viii)\n\nThe ML sold 12,699 copies of *Great Modern Short Stories* between 1 May\n1942 and 1 November 1943; the total includes sales of Overton’s edition\n(188) as well as Cerf’s.\n\n#### 361.2a.
