<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of all the historical novels of recent times, none has found such
widespread public response as Robert Grave’s reconstruction of the
grandeur and folly and fantastic sensuality of Imperial Rome. The mild
Claudius, moving unobtrusively among his sinister relatives and
recording their proud and vile history, unfolds a panorama of weird
intrigue and startling events. Poison, blasphemy, incest, black magic
and unnatural vice flourish with a fine disdain for the good opinion
of history. Such worthies as Caligula, Nero and Messalina come to life
in a book as historically accurate as it is enthralling. (<em>Spring
1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934. ML
edition (301.1) printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published February 1937. <em>WR</em> 27 February 1937. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; restored to ML 1982.</p>
<p>The Smith and Haas typesetting was too large for the ML’s format and
included a folding genealogical table of the Imperial family that was
omitted from the ML edition. By reducing the type size the ML was able
produce a volume that was 67 pages shorter than the Smith and Haas
edition. The ML plates were also used for a Grosset &amp; Dunlap printing
which retained the biographical note (p. [v]) written for the ML.</p>
<p><em>I, Claudius</em> sold 5,215 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. By June
1964 the ML had printed 89,000 copies (Higginson, p. 56).</p>

Signed:\nCassens.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Of all the historical novels of recent times, none has found such\n> widespread public response as Robert Grave’s reconstruction of the\n> grandeur and folly and fantastic sensuality of Imperial Rome. The mild\n> Claudius, moving unobtrusively among his sinister relatives and\n> recording their proud and vile history, unfolds a panorama of weird\n> intrigue and startling events. Poison, blasphemy, incest, black magic\n> and unnatural vice flourish with a fine disdain for the good opinion\n> of history. Such worthies as Caligula, Nero and Messalina come to life\n> in a book as historically accurate as it is enthralling. (*Spring\n> 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934. ML\nedition (301.1) printed from plates made from a new typesetting.\nPublished February 1937. *WR* 27 February 1937. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; restored to ML 1982.\n\nThe Smith and Haas typesetting was too large for the ML’s format and\nincluded a folding genealogical table of the Imperial family that was\nomitted from the ML edition. By reducing the type size the ML was able\nproduce a volume that was 67 pages shorter than the Smith and Haas\nedition. The ML plates were also used for a Grosset & Dunlap printing\nwhich retained the biographical note (p. \\[v\\]) written for the ML.\n\n*I, Claudius* sold 5,215 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. By June\n1964 the ML had printed 89,000 copies (Higginson, p. 56).\n\n#### 301.1b.
