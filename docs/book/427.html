<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Since 1881, when it was first published, <em>Washington Square</em> has had
three incarnations. In its original form, it was the novel by which
Henry James won world-wide recognition in his early maturity. As a
play, under the title <em>The Heiress</em>, its glowing story held thousands
of theatre-goers under its spell. Finally, as a motion picture, under
its new title, the novel once again gave evidence of its vitality and
popularity to a new mass audience. Now <em>Washington Square</em> takes an
honored place in the Modern Library with three other famous works by
Henry James: <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>, No. 169, <em>The Wings of the
Dove</em>, No. 244, and <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, No. 107. Clifton Fadiman
contributes an illuminating and perceptive Introduction for this
distinguished addition to the series. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This “small, gracefully proportioned masterpiece,” as Clifton Fadiman
describes <em>Washington Square</em> in his Introduction, is one of the few
of James’ novels to concern itself solely with America and Americans,
and is perhaps the finest product of his early period.</p>
