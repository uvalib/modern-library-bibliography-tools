<p><em>Format:</em> 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. (181 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and the
variant Blumenthal binding without the torchbearer on the front panel.
The binding appears to have been used only for first printings of the
two new titles published in October 1939, Fielding, <em>Joseph Andrews</em>
(323) and Fineman, <em>Hear Ye Sons</em>.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in dark yellowish green (137) and black on
coated white paper with title in reverse against dark yellowish green
background, other lettering in black, and vertical borders in reverse at
left. Probably designed by Joseph Blumenthal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Nothing could be more timely than a novel which re-affirms the
nobility and integrity of the Jewish people. Such a novel is <em>Hear, Ye
Sons</em> and it is revived at a moment when persecution of a defenseless
minority is spreading all over the world. The most popular book by the
author of <em>Doctor Addams</em>, a national best-seller, <em>Hear, Ye Sons</em> is
a story recommended to readers of every taste and every racial and
religious origin. It is a novel alive with the spirit of tolerance.
(<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1933. ML edition (pp.
[<em>7</em>], vii–306) printed from Longmans, Green plates. Published October
1939. <em>WR</em> 14 October 1939. First (and only) printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1942.</p>
<p>Ford Madox Ford wrote to the ML in 1933 praising <em>Hear, Ye Sons</em>, and
Cerf may have told Fineman that he was interested in a ML edition.
Fineman indicated in 1938 that reprint houses had been asking for the
book for several years but that he had held off, hoping that it would
appear in the ML. He added that if the ML did not want it he would let
it go to another reprinter (Fineman to Cerf, 26 December 1938). Cerf
replied two days later that he wanted to publish <em>Hear, Ye Sons</em> in fall
1939 and invited Fineman to write a new preface (Cerf to Fineman, 28
December 1939). “A Belated Preface” (pp. [i–v]) was written for the ML
edition.</p>
<p>The ML edition of <em>Hear, Ye Sons</em> sold poorly and was discontinued after
two years and two-and-a-half months, making it the shortest-lived ML
title. John Davidson, <em>Poems</em> (107), published by Boni &amp; Liveright in
April 1924 and discontinued at the end of 1926, outlasted <em>Hear, Ye
Sons</em> by six months and was the second shortest-lived title.</p>

Published October\n1939. *WR* 14 October 1939. First (and only) printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1942.\n\nFord Madox Ford wrote to the ML in 1933 praising *Hear, Ye Sons*, and\nCerf may have told Fineman that he was interested in a ML edition.\nFineman indicated in 1938 that reprint houses had been asking for the\nbook for several years but that he had held off, hoping that it would\nappear in the ML. He added that if the ML did not want it he would let\nit go to another reprinter (Fineman to Cerf, 26 December 1938). Cerf\nreplied two days later that he wanted to publish *Hear, Ye Sons* in fall\n1939 and invited Fineman to write a new preface (Cerf to Fineman, 28\nDecember 1939). “A Belated Preface” (pp. \\[i–v\\]) was written for the ML\nedition.\n\nThe ML edition of *Hear, Ye Sons* sold poorly and was discontinued after\ntwo years and two-and-a-half months, making it the shortest-lived ML\ntitle. John Davidson, *Poems* (107), published by Boni & Liveright in\nApril 1924 and discontinued at the end of 1926, outlasted *Hear, Ye\nSons* by six months and was the second shortest-lived title.",

(181 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and the\nvariant Blumenthal binding without the torchbearer on the front panel.\nThe binding appears to have been used only for first printings of the\ntwo new titles published in October 1939, Fielding, *Joseph Andrews*\n(323) and Fineman, *Hear Ye Sons*.\n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in dark yellowish green (137) and black on\ncoated white paper with title in reverse against dark yellowish green\nbackground, other lettering in black, and vertical borders in reverse at\nleft. Probably designed by Joseph Blumenthal.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Nothing could be more timely than a novel which re-affirms the\n> nobility and integrity of the Jewish people. Such a novel is *Hear, Ye\n> Sons* and it is revived at a moment when persecution of a defenseless\n> minority is spreading all over the world. The most popular book by the\n> author of *Doctor Addams*, a national best-seller, *Hear, Ye Sons* is\n> a story recommended to readers of every taste and every racial and\n> religious origin. It is a novel alive with the spirit of tolerance.\n> (*Fall 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Longmans, Green & Co., 1933. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*7*\\], vii–306) printed from Longmans, Green plates. Published October\n1939. *WR* 14 October 1939. First (and only) printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1942.\n\nFord Madox Ford wrote to the ML in 1933 praising *Hear, Ye Sons*, and\nCerf may have told Fineman that he was interested in a ML edition.\nFineman indicated in 1938 that reprint houses had been asking for the\nbook for several years but that he had held off, hoping that it would\nappear in the ML. He added that if the ML did not want it he would let\nit go to another reprinter (Fineman to Cerf, 26 December 1938). Cerf\nreplied two days later that he wanted to publish *Hear, Ye Sons* in fall\n1939 and invited Fineman to write a new preface (Cerf to Fineman, 28\nDecember 1939). “A Belated Preface” (pp. \\[i–v\\]) was written for the ML\nedition.\n\nThe ML edition of *Hear, Ye Sons* sold poorly and was discontinued after\ntwo years and two-and-a-half months, making it the shortest-lived ML\ntitle. John Davidson, *Poems* (107), published by Boni & Liveright in\nApril 1924 and discontinued at the end of 1926, outlasted *Hear, Ye\nSons* by six months and was the second shortest-lived title."
