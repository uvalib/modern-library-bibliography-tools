LIBRARY BOOK” in brilliant yellow against the lower panel; backstrip in
deep reddish brown with lettering in reverse and title enclosed in
brilliant yellow frame. Signed: J. O’H. Cosgrave II.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
By the test of time alone, Edith Wharton’s <em>Age of Innocence</em> has more
than justified the enthusiastic adjectives applied to it when it was
first published more than twenty years ago [±first published and
acclaimed in 1920]. Then it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for
Literature, and ever since has been winning new favor in the eyes of
judges of enduring American fiction. This story of New York before it
became of age captures the spirit of the metropolis and preserves for
us the social history of an era, in the decade of the 1870’s, when
elegance and gallantry were on display on gas-lit Fifth Avenue.
(<em>Spring 1943; [Spring 1958]</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published by D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1920. ML edition (363.1, pp.
[<em>7</em>], 1–[365] printed from Appleton-Century plates. Published March
1943. <em>WR</em> 13 March 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>The merger between D. Appleton &amp; Co. and the Century Co. took place in
1933, ten years before the ML edition was published.</p>
<p>The first ML printing includes all the textual variants noted by
Garrison (pp. 230–31) as having been incorporated in the third, fourth,
fifth, tenth, and twenty-first Appleton printings except p. 26, line 25,
where a semi-colon rather than a comma follows “gone out.” The
semi-colon is retained in the 1953 John Lehmann printing, from which the
1967 ML edition (363.2) is reproduced, and in the Library of America
edition of <em>The Age of Innocence</em> and three other Wharton novels (1985).</p>
<p>Grosset &amp; Dunlap printings from Appleton plates were available in the
1920s and 1930s, first in Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s Popular Copyright Series
and subsequently in its Novels of Distinction series (Garrison, p. 235).</p>
<p>There was a second ML printing of 1,500 copies in July 1943.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 4,168 copies by 1 November 1943. Garrison (p. 236)
cites a letter that refers to a projected first ML printing of 7,500
copies; given the timing of the second printing and the sales achieved
by November 1943 a first printing of 5,000 copies appears more likely.</p>

Appleton & Co., 1920. ML edition (363.1, pp.\n\\[*7*\\], 1–\\[365\\] printed from Appleton-Century plates. Published March\n1943. *WR* 13 March 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nThe merger between D. Appleton & Co. and the Century Co. took place in\n1933, ten years before the ML edition was published.\n\nThe first ML printing includes all the textual variants noted by\nGarrison (pp. 230–31) as having been incorporated in the third, fourth,\nfifth, tenth, and twenty-first Appleton printings except p. 26, line 25,\nwhere a semi-colon rather than a comma follows “gone out.” The\nsemi-colon is retained in the 1953 John Lehmann printing, from which the\n1967 ML edition (363.2) is reproduced, and in the Library of America\nedition of *The Age of Innocence* and three other Wharton novels (1985).\n\nGrosset & Dunlap printings from Appleton plates were available in the\n1920s and 1930s, first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Popular Copyright Series\nand subsequently in its Novels of Distinction series (Garrison, p. 235).\n\nThere was a second ML printing of 1,500 copies in July 1943.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,168 copies by 1 November 1943. Garrison (p. 236)\ncites a letter that refers to a projected first ML printing of 7,500\ncopies; given the timing of the second printing and the sales achieved\nby November 1943 a first printing of 5,000 copies appears more likely.",
