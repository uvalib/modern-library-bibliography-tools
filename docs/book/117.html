<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>Written by Dumas when he was twenty-five, CAMILLE remains in its
combination of freshness and form and of the feeling of the springtime
of life, a singular, an astonishing piece of work. The novel and the
play have been blown about the world at a fearful rate, but the story
has never lost its happy juvenility, a charm that nothing can
vulgarize. It is all champagne and tears – fresh perversity, fresh
credulity, fresh passion, fresh pain. We have seen the play both well
done and ill done – in strange places, in barbarous tongues. But
nothing makes any difference – it carries with it an April air: some
tender young man and some coughing young woman have only to speak the
lines to give it a great place among the love-stories of the world.
HENRY JAMES (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front abridged from
Henry James quotation on jacket A: “A novel and play that have been
blown about the world—but nothing can alter it. It is all champagne and
tears—fresh passion, fresh pain—one of the great love stories of the
world.” <span class="smallcaps">Henry James</span> (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
New generations of readers respond as their parents and grandparents
did with unashamed tears to the sad plight of the beautiful and doomed
Marguerite Gautier. <em>Camille</em> retains its fragrance through the years;
it is a tale that stirs an unassuageable heartache, and over it there
hovers a sentiment forever tender and yearning. It is read now as it
was before and as it will be read years hence as the love story of the
eternal Magdalene glorified by her passion and misfortune. (<em>Spring
1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in strong yellowish pink (26), pale blue (185) and
black on coated cream paper depicting a woman seated in an open coach
driven by a bearded coachman; title in strong yellowish pink with
three-dimensional shading in black, other lettering in black. Signed:
Galdone. Front flap as jacket B. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
<p>Translation originally published in U.S. as <em>The Lady of the Camellias</em>
in the French Classical Romances series (D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1902). The
source of the plates has not been identified; the ML edition may have
been printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25
October 1925. <em>WR</em> 14 November 1925. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970.</p>
<p>Gosse was editor-in-chief of the French Classical Romances series. His
introduction and biographical note are taken from the Appleton edition,
where the ML introduction constitutes the last third (pp. xxiii–xxxii)
of his longer critical essay, “The Novels of Alexandre Dumas the
Younger.” The ML paid Appleton a permissions fee of $25 for their use.
The translation appears to have been in the public domain.</p>
<p><em>Camille</em> sold 2,340 copies during the first half of 1928, placing it
thirty-sixth among 147 ML titles. It ranked in the fourth quarter of ML
sales during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943.</p>
