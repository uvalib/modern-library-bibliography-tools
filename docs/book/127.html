<p>Text on front:<br>
“Never before had I seen so much candour in print, with the exception
of the Bible. So I judged ‘Moll Flanders’ to be a second Bible that
all true believers should study with profit and reverence. How much
more to be preferred is this simple candour of Defoe’s great novel to
the suggestiveness in some of our present-day writings!” —W. H. Davies
(<em>Fall 1926</em>)</p>

unabridged</em>)</p>

<p>Sales of <em>Moll Flanders</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it

1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did
not rank among the 100 best-selling title in the regular ML during
November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Born with the most rudimentary kind of moral sense, Moll Flanders made
a career of harlotry, thievery and penitence. The book of her fortunes
and misfortunes, her high misdemeanors and amorous delinquencies,
remains today, as it was two hundred years ago, the liveliest and most
candid record of a bawd’s progress on the primrose path. The looseness
of Moll’s life in folly and wickedness points the moral that the wages
of sin need not be punishment and death; sometimes penitence alone
redeems the most versatile sinner. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in grayish yellow green (122), strong orange (50)
and black on coated white paper depicting a woman with parasol and a man
in background with an eyeglass and walking stick; lettering in black.
Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1937; signed. Front flap as jacket A.
(<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
<p>There was a fall 1939 printing of 127.1b after the ML’s larger format
was introduced. Not all ML titles could be switched immediately to the
new format since jacket art that was not being replaced had to be
adapted to the larger format. The two printings in spring and fall 1939
were probably small ones. The fall 1940 printing described under 127.1c
was probably the first in the Blumenthal format. Copies of the fall 1939
printing in the balloon cloth format have been seen with the remainder
stamp of a red star on the rear endpaper.</p>

Erskine offered Schorer $150 to write the introduction; Schorer accepted
the invitation but asked for $250, which he indicated was more in line
with the terms offered by Rinehart Editions (Erskine to Schorer, 26
January 1950; Schorer telegram to Erskine, 30 January 1950). Erskine
countered with an offer of $200 which Schorer accepted.</p>

ornamented lettering, ornamental flourishes in deep purplish red, strong

The somewhat crowded feel of the 127.2a jacket is corrected in the
127.2b jacket which not only is ¼ inch taller but reduces the size of
the lettering and decoration by a few millimeters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Moll Flanders</em>, published in 1772, was among the first novels to
appear in English, and contributed to the development of the novel
form. It relates the autobiography of its unrestrained heroine, who
was born in Newgate Prison and spent parts of her life as a harlot, a
wife, a thief, a convict, and finally a prosperous penitent in the
American colonies. Moll is one of the great picaresque figures in
literature, whose vitality and gusto remain undiminished by the
passage of time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Born with the most rudimentary kind of moral sense, Moll Flanders made
a flamboyant life of prostitution, thievery and, finally, penitence.
This vivid saga of a beautiful, clever woman, her high misdemeanors
and delinquencies, her varied careers as a prostitute, a charming and
faithful wife, a thief and convict, remains today the liveliest, most
candid record of an eighteenth-century woman’s progress through the
hypocritical labyrinth of her society ever recorded. This book,
written by Defoe under an assumed name, so his readers would think it
an accurate journal of one woman’s life, remains a picaresque novel of
astonishing vitality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Printed from the original letterpress plates with Schorer introduction
and Author’s Preface omitted. Published fall 1985 at $9.95. ISBN
0-394-60530-6. Discontinued fall 1991.</p>
<p>The letterpress plates show serious signs of wear. Some of the page
numerals in the headline are particularly battered. The Modern Library
reverted to letterpress printing for some volumes in the reissue format
(R. D. Scudellari to GBN, interview), probably to take advantage of
price breaks for using idle letterpress equipment after most book
printing had shifted to offset lithography.</p>

Front flap as jacket A.\n(*Spring 1939*)\n\nThere was a fall 1939 printing of 127.1b after the ML’s larger format\nwas introduced. Not all ML titles could be switched immediately to the\nnew format since jacket art that was not being replaced had to be\nadapted to the larger format. The two printings in spring and fall 1939\nwere probably small ones. The fall 1940 printing described under 127.1c\nwas probably the first in the Blumenthal format. Copies of the fall 1939\nprinting in the balloon cloth format have been seen with the remainder\nstamp of a red star on the rear endpaper.\n\n#### 127.1c.

The Modern Library\nreverted to letterpress printing for some volumes in the reissue format\n(R. D. Scudellari to GBN, interview), probably to take advantage of\nprice breaks for using idle letterpress equipment after most book\nprinting had shifted to offset lithography.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDefoe, *Robinson Crusoe & The Journal of the Plague Year* (1948–1970)\n411",
