<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Issued on the one hundredth anniversary of William Wordsworth’s death, this volume is both commemorative and representative. It bears testimony to the continuing vitality of one of the greatest of England’s imaginative, romantic poets. In its more than 700 pages are to be found all that the modern reader can demand. Here included are the “Descriptive Sketches,” “Lyrical Ballads,” tales, sonnets, odes, pastorals, “The Prelude,” “Ecclesiastical Sonnets” and a wide selection of long and short miscellaneous verse. Mark Van Doren, poet, essayist and teacher, has made a generous yet discriminating selection from the vast body of writing achieved by Wordsworth during the almost fifty years he devoted to poetry. Mr. Van Doren’s Introduction is an illuminating critical interpretation of the poet and his work. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published spring 1950. <em>WR</em> 15 April 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Van Doren received a flat fee of $1,000 for his work on the ML Wordsworth (Cerf to Van Doren, 26 July 1946). The text was set at Van Doren’s suggestion from the Cambridge Edition of <em>The Complete Poetical Works of William Wordsworth</em> (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1904).</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> As 426a. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
<p>The two-page “Bibliography of Wordsworth” consisting of Works by Wordsworth and Criticism and Bibliography originally appeared in MLCE (1950) and in the regular ML in 1951. Stein decided before the first printing of the regular ML edition appeared that he wanted to include Wordsworth’s <em>Selected Poetry</em> in MLCE. He offered Van Doren an additional $50 to prepare a bibliography, which was a standard feature of the College Editions (Stein to Van Doren, 23 February 1950). The second printing of the regular ML edition used the MLCE text and appears to have been published by the end of 1951. The earliest printing examined dates from spring 1954.</p>

It bears testimony to the continuing vitality of one of the greatest of England’s imaginative, romantic poets. In its more than 700 pages are to be found all that the modern reader can demand. Here included are the “Descriptive Sketches,” “Lyrical Ballads,” tales, sonnets, odes, pastorals, “The Prelude,” “Ecclesiastical Sonnets” and a wide selection of long and short miscellaneous verse. Mark Van Doren, poet, essayist and teacher, has made a generous yet discriminating selection from the vast body of writing achieved by Wordsworth during the almost fifty years he devoted to poetry. Mr. Van Doren’s Introduction is an illuminating critical interpretation of the poet and his work. (*Spring 1950*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published spring 1950. *WR* 15 April 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. \n\nVan Doren received a flat fee of \\$1,000 for his work on the ML Wordsworth (Cerf to Van Doren, 26 July 1946).

He offered Van Doren an additional \\$50 to prepare a bibliography, which was a standard feature of the College Editions (Stein to Van Doren, 23 February 1950).
