<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Ernest Renan’s whole education formed a preparation for his task of
chronicling the beginnings of Christianity; all his studies were
subsidiary to the historical treatment of what, in his view, was the
most significant cycle of events in history. <em>The Life of Jesus</em> was
finally written in 1863 in Palestine, in the very midst of the scenes
in which the tragic story it relates had taken place. The storm that
broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and
to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their
outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was
qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly
comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends.
John Haynes Holmes’ introduction appears exclusively in the Modern
Library edition of this book. (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s <em>Life of Jesus</em>
was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and
literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation
created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its
most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete
accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry
with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the
beginnings of the Christian era. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was
originally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML
edition (pp. [<em>5</em>–<em>7</em>], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with
Hutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. [<em>5</em>]
reset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction.
Published December 1927. <em>WR</em> 7 January 1928. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Two other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. <em>The
Life of Jesus</em> was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton,
1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation
by the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd
French edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations,
was published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little,
Brown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on
economic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have
required royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public
domain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for
the ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson
translation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying
royalties and the cost of resetting the text.</p>
<p>Klopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The
Renan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore”
(Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University
Library; published in Cerf and Klopfer, <em>Dear Donald, Dear Bennett</em>, p.
87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as
“Renoir”). The bad plates continued to be used into the 1960s.</p>
<p>Holmes, minister of the Community Church in New York City, received $50
for the introduction.</p>
