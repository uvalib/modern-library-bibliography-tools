<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Included in this volume are the complete essays, representative poems,
public addresses, biographical sketches and miscellaneous writings
from the pen of the first philosopher of the American spirit. The
influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s character and thought on our
culture is immeasurable. His example and his eloquence have given our
entire way of life direction and impetus for the last half of the
nineteenth century and the first of the twentieth. Here, in more than
950 pages, is the quintessence of his life work, edited with
scholarship and sensibility, by Brooks Atkinson, drama critic of the
<em>New York Times</em>, and with a special foreword by Tremaine McDowell,
Professor of English, University of Minnesota. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Front flap reverts to 334a text. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.
McDowell received a flat fee of $75 for his foreword and bibliography

<p>Jason Epstein recommended the title change after several readers
complained that the ML edition did not contain Emerson’s complete
essays:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volume includes the Essays First Series, Essays Second Series and
English Traits which the editors presumably regard as the only volumes
of essays that Emerson assembled. <em>The Conduct of Life</em>, from which
they have excerpted two sections, apparently is considered a whole
book and not a collection of essays, but this is an ambiguous point
and I think it would be much less confusing to have the title of this
book changed to THE SELECTED WRITINGS OF RALPH WALDO EMERSON (Epstein
memo to Cerf, 12 January 1960).</p>

<p>Most ML books had been printed by offset lithography since the
mid-1960s, when the cost of offset printing dropped below that of
letterpress. The ML reverted to letterpress for several titles in the
mid-1970s, presumably attracted by incentives offered by printers
desperate to make use of idle letterpress equipment.</p>
