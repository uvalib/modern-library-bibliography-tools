<p><strong>ERNEST HEMINGWAY. A FAREWELL TO ARMS. 1932–1953. (ML 19)</strong></p>
<h4>237a. First printing (1932)</h4>

CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK</p>
<p>Pp. [i–viii] ix–xx, [1–2] 3–355 [356–364]. [1–12]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] pub note A6; [iii] title; [iv] <em>Copyright,</em> 1929, <em>by</em> CHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS | [short double rule] | <em>Introduction Copyright,</em> 1932, <em>by</em> THE MODERN | LIBRARY, INC. | [short double rule] | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | 1932; [v] dedication; [vi] blank; [vii] fly title; [viii] blank; ix–xx INTRODUCTION signed p. xx: <span class="smallcaps">Ford Madox Ford</span>. | <span class="smallcaps">Paris</span>, <em>January,</em> 1932.; [1] part title: A FAREWELL TO ARMS | [short rule] | <em>BOOK I</em>; [2] blank; 3–355 text; [356] blank; [357–361] ML list; [362–364] blank. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper depicting a woman and man in left profile with mountains and clouds in background; borders in deep reddish orange, lettering in black. Signed: L. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving romance, <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>, have won acclaim from the critics, support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators. Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed, athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s strength. <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> is an exciting book, true to its time and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. [v–vii], [1]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half title used as a fly title. Published May 1932. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1932. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.</p>
<p>The ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s <em>Sun Also Rises</em> (190). Cerf initially hoped to publish <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> in September 1931 (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931 publication of Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January 1932).</p>
<p>There were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies (July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March 1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling 14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111 copies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> sold 12,287 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>
<p>Scribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of the Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr., Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound edition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.</p>

Signed: L. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving romance, *A Farewell to Arms*, have won acclaim from the critics, support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators. Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed, athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s strength. *A Farewell to Arms* is an exciting book, true to its time and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. [v–vii], [1]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half title used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.  \n\nThe ML offered Scribner’s a \\$6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf initially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931 publication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering \\$75 and indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January 1932).  \n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies (July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March 1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling 14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111 copies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *A Farewell to Arms* sold 12,287 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of *The Sun Also Rises*.

Signed: L. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving romance, *A Farewell to Arms*, have won acclaim from the critics, support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators. Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed, athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s strength. *A Farewell to Arms* is an exciting book, true to its time and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. [v–vii], [1]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half title used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.  \n\nThe ML offered Scribner’s a \\$6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf initially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931 publication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering \\$75 and indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January 1932).  \n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies (July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March 1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling 14,000 copies.
