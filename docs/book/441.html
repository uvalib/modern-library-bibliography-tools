<p>Original ML anthology. Published fall 1951. <em>WR</em> 29 December 1951. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Six Modern American Plays</em> was originally intended for Modern Library College Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and added later to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee $150 for selecting the plays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950). Halline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline began by suggesting Anderson’s <em>Winterset</em>, Kaufman and Hart’s <em>The Man Who Came to Dinner</em>, O’Neill’s <em>Mourning Becomes Electra</em>, Robert Sherwood’s <em>There Shall Be No Night</em>, Philip Barry’s <em>Hotel Universe</em>, and Sidney Howard’s <em>Yellow Jack</em>. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who rejected <em>Hotel Universe</em> and <em>Yellow Jack</em> and indicated his preferred for O’Neill’s <em>Emperor Jones</em> and Sherwood’s <em>Abe Lincoln in Illinois</em>.</p>
<p>Stein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’s <em>Little Foxes</em>. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new dramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’s <em>Glass Menagerie</em> or <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, Arthur Miller’s <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, or Heggen and Logan’s <em>Mister Roberts;</em> his own preference, he indicated, was Williams. Halline approved <em>The Emperor Jones</em>, <em>Abe Lincoln in Illinois</em> and <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> (Halline to Stein, 28 September 1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup: <em>The Emperor Jones</em>, <em>Winterset</em>, <em>The Man Who Came to Dinner</em>, <em>The Little Foxes</em>, <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, and <em>Abe Lincoln in Illinois</em>. Sherwood’s play was dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission. <em>Death of a Salesman</em> was the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty than the ML was prepared to pay. <em>Mister Roberts</em> was finally selected, in part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid royalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay half a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition.</p>
<p>In the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the introduction only.</p>
<p>Stein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out the anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The costs of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College Edition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find some way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline, 25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951). <em>Six Modern American Plays</em> was added to MLCE in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>O’Neill’s <em>Emperor Jones</em> is reprinted in the version originally published by Boni and Liveright in 1921. For more information see O’Neill, <em>The Emperor Jones; The Straw</em> (1928: 157).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Published spring 1978 at $5.95. ISBN 0-394-60457-1.</p>
<p>The title change from <em>Six Modern American Plays</em> to <em>Six Great American Plays</em> appears to have been motivated by the realization that the plays, which dated from 1920 to 1948, ranged in age from thirty and fifty-eight years old.</p>

The emergence of our internationally famous playwrights has won the world’s attention and respect. This volume, representative of the finest work of America’s foremost dramatists, brings together[+,] for the excitement and delight of the reader [+, a half dozen] plays in a variety of moods and forms: Eugene O’Neill’s imaginative *The Emperor Jones*, Maxwell Anderson’s tense *Winterset*, Kaufman and Hart’s satirical *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, Lillian Hellman’s bitterly penetrating *The Little Foxes*, Tennessee Williams’ sensitive *The Glass Menagerie*, and Heggen and Logan’s robust comedy *Mister Roberts*. (*Fall 1951; Spring 1962]*) \n\n*Jacket A2:* As jacket A1 except on coated white paper. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A1 with spring 1962 flap text. (*Mid-1960s*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published fall 1951. *WR* 29 December 1951. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\n*Six Modern American Plays* was originally intended for Modern Library College Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and added later to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee \\$150 for selecting the plays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950). Halline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline began by suggesting Anderson’s *Winterset*, Kaufman and Hart’s *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, O’Neill’s *Mourning Becomes Electra*, Robert Sherwood’s *There Shall Be No Night*, Philip Barry’s *Hotel Universe*, and Sidney Howard’s *Yellow Jack*. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who rejected *Hotel Universe* and *Yellow Jack* and indicated his preferred for O’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* and Sherwood’s *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*. \n\nStein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’s *Little Foxes*. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new dramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’s *Glass Menagerie* or *A Streetcar Named Desire*, Arthur Miller’s *Death of a Salesman*, or Heggen and Logan’s *Mister Roberts;* his own preference, he indicated, was Williams. Halline approved *The Emperor Jones*, *Abe Lincoln in Illinois* and *The Glass Menagerie* (Halline to Stein, 28 September 1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup: *The Emperor Jones*, *Winterset*, *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, *The Little Foxes*, *The Glass Menagerie*, and *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*. Sherwood’s play was dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission. *Death of a Salesman* was the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty than the ML was prepared to pay. *Mister Roberts* was finally selected, in part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid royalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay half a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition. \n\nIn the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the introduction only. \n\nStein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out the anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The costs of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College Edition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find some way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline, 25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951). *Six Modern American Plays* was added to MLCE in the mid-1960s. \n\nO’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* is reprinted in the version originally published by Boni and Liveright in 1921.
