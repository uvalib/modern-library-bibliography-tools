<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the few years that have elapsed since the publication of <em>Seven
Gothic Tales</em>, it has established itself among discerning readers as a
modern classic. In order to add an increasing number of admirers to
those who have been acclaiming this book in its more expensive format,
the editors of the Modern Library include it in the series. The
felicity of writing, the charm and dramatic power of these tales,
their dignity and beauty, create a spell for readers of every shade of
interest. Dorothy Canfield contributes an illuminating introduction.
(<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934,
two years before the firm was acquired by Random House. ML edition (pp.
v–420) printed from Smith and Haas/RH plates with decorative borders
omitted from part title pages and part titles printed in black gothic
type instead of red. Published April 1939. <em>WR</em> 8 April 1939. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Published in Vintage
Books, September 1972; restored to ML, 1980.</p>
<p>The 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format was used because the original plates were too
large for the ML’s standard balloon cloth format. Even with the larger
format the margins of the printed pages are uncomfortably narrow. The
switch from letterpress to offset lithographic printing in the 1960s
allowed the type page of 320c to be reduced photographically from 160 x
98 mm to 146 x 90 mm. This allowed larger margins, but the substantial
reduction in type size made the text harder to read. A happy medium is
achieved in 320d. The format is increased to 7½ x 4⅞ in., and the type
page has been increased photographically to 155 x 88 mm. However, the
volume is an early example of perfect binding rather than sewn, and it
is not unusual to find copies today that are falling apart.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,154 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,
placing <em>Seven Gothic Tales</em> near the top of the second quarter of ML
titles during this 18-month period. It was not among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period,
November 1951–October 1952. In contrast, sales of Dinesen’s <em>Out of
Africa</em> (447), published in the ML in April 1952, placed it near the top
of the second quarter of ML sales for the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Seven Gothic Tales</em> was an immediate sensation when it was first
published in 1934, and there was much speculation about the author
before it was revealed that “Isak Dinesen” was actually the Danish
Baroness Blixen, who had written this, her first book, in English.
Since then, <em>Tales</em> has established itself as a classic. By using
modern perceptions within the framework of the old Gothic tale,
Baroness Blixen created, as one of her early critics wrote, “a book of
unique atmosphere . . . a book bringing the psychological insight of a
Henry James to the material of a Northern Boccaccio . . . a book of
extraordinary fantasy that yet takes us intimately into a vivid
variety of human lives.”</p>

(182 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and balloon\ncloth binding D.\n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in vivid red (11), black and gold on coated\ncream paper with title at top in black letters highlighted in red except\nlarge initial “S” in red highlighted in gold, all against drawing of an\nunfurled scroll surrounded by grape vines; author and other lettering in\nblack on smaller white panel bordered in red below scroll, all against\nblack background; spine in red with lettering in reverse.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> In the few years that have elapsed since the publication of *Seven\n> Gothic Tales*, it has established itself among discerning readers as a\n> modern classic. In order to add an increasing number of admirers to\n> those who have been acclaiming this book in its more expensive format,\n> the editors of the Modern Library include it in the series. The\n> felicity of writing, the charm and dramatic power of these tales,\n> their dignity and beauty, create a spell for readers of every shade of\n> interest. Dorothy Canfield contributes an illuminating introduction.\n> (*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934,\ntwo years before the firm was acquired by Random House. ML edition (pp.\nv–420) printed from Smith and Haas/RH plates with decorative borders\nomitted from part title pages and part titles printed in black gothic\ntype instead of red. Published April 1939. *WR* 8 April 1939. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Published in Vintage\nBooks, September 1972; restored to ML, 1980.\n\nThe 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format was used because the original plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s standard balloon cloth format. Even with the larger\nformat the margins of the printed pages are uncomfortably narrow. The\nswitch from letterpress to offset lithographic printing in the 1960s\nallowed the type page of 320c to be reduced photographically from 160 x\n98 mm to 146 x 90 mm. This allowed larger margins, but the substantial\nreduction in type size made the text harder to read. A happy medium is\nachieved in 320d. The format is increased to 7½ x 4⅞ in., and the type\npage has been increased photographically to 155 x 88 mm. However, the\nvolume is an early example of perfect binding rather than sewn, and it\nis not unusual to find copies today that are falling apart.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,154 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing *Seven Gothic Tales* near the top of the second quarter of ML\ntitles during this 18-month period. It was not among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952. In contrast, sales of Dinesen’s *Out of\nAfrica* (447), published in the ML in April 1952, placed it near the top\nof the second quarter of ML sales for the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 320b.

By using\n> modern perceptions within the framework of the old Gothic tale,\n> Baroness Blixen created, as one of her early critics wrote, “a book of\n> unique atmosphere . . . a book bringing the psychological insight of a\n> Henry James to the material of a Northern Boccaccio . . . a book of\n> extraordinary fantasy that yet takes us intimately into a vivid\n> variety of human lives.”\n\nPublished spring 1980 at $5.95.
