<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats, Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes them unmistakably Irish. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Publication announced for spring 1954 and postponed to fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 20 November 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Greene received a flat fee of $750 for his work on the anthology. The permissions budget was limited to $1,500, and the scope of the anthology was reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by Yeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted $25 per poem for American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate, wanted an additional $20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to $12.50 per poem, but this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the sales territory for <em>An Anthology of Irish Literature</em> to the U.S. and Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The representation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well.</p>
<p>Frank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s <em>The Midnight Court</em> for the anthology.</p>

Signed: RIKI. \n\n> Front flap:<br> This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats, Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes them unmistakably Irish. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Publication announced for spring 1954 and postponed to fall 1954. *WR* 20 November 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nGreene received a flat fee of \\$750 for his work on the anthology. The permissions budget was limited to \\$1,500, and the scope of the anthology was reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by Yeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted \\$25 per poem for American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate, wanted an additional \\$20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to \\$12.50 per poem, but this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the sales territory for *An Anthology of Irish Literature* to the U.S. and Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The representation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well. \n\nFrank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s *The Midnight Court* for the anthology. \n\n#### 470b.
