<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the
rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of
Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by
scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the
great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry
themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and
Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the
love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are
quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people
of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats,
Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who
write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes
them unmistakably Irish. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Publication announced for spring 1954 and
postponed to fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 20 November 1954. First printing: 5,000
copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Greene received a flat fee of $750 for his work on the anthology. The
permissions budget was limited to $1,500, and the scope of the anthology
was reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by
Yeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted $25 per poem
for American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate,
wanted an additional $20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats
poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to $12.50 per poem, but
this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the
sales territory for <em>An Anthology of Irish Literature</em> to the U.S. and
Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The
representation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well.</p>
<p>Frank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s <em>The Midnight
Court</em> for the anthology.</p>

Signed: RIKI.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the\n> rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of\n> Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by\n> scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the\n> great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry\n> themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and\n> Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the\n> love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are\n> quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people\n> of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats,\n> Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who\n> write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes\n> them unmistakably Irish. (*Spring 1954*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Publication announced for spring 1954 and\npostponed to fall 1954. *WR* 20 November 1954. First printing: 5,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nGreene received a flat fee of $750 for his work on the anthology. The\npermissions budget was limited to $1,500, and the scope of the anthology\nwas reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by\nYeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted $25 per poem\nfor American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate,\nwanted an additional $20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats\npoems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to $12.50 per poem, but\nthis was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the\nsales territory for *An Anthology of Irish Literature* to the U.S. and\nCanada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The\nrepresentation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well.\n\nFrank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s *The Midnight\nCourt* for the anthology.\n\n#### 470b.
