<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Nothing could be more timely than the publication at this moment of history of the two works which made Machiavelli both famous and infamous as a model for contemporary statesmen. <em>The Prince</em> and <em>The Discourses</em> have become required reading for an understanding of our daily newspaper headlines. These books have never before been printed in a single volume. The texts are complete and unabridged. An illuminating introduction is provided by Max Lerner of Williams College and until recently editor of <em>The Nation</em>. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ricci translation of <em>The Prince</em> originally published in London in World’s Classics, 1906; Vincent revision originally published in World’s Classics, 1935. Detmold translation of <em>The Discourses</em> originally published by James R. Osgood &amp; Co., 1882, as part of Machiavelli’s <em>Historical, Political, and Diplomatic Writings</em>. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1940. <em>WR</em> 6 April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.</p>
<p>Machiavelli was included in the ML at Max Lerner’s recommendation. Lerner received $75 for the introduction, $25 more than the ML’s usual fee (Cerf to Linscott, 30 August 1940). The ML edition sold 8,721 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943 and 4,634 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it securely in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both of these periods. Sales totaled 114,857 copies by spring 1958.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap with last sentence revised as follows: “An illuminating introduction is provided by Max Lerner who traces the career and thought of the first analyst of power and the uses to which political domination can be put for aggression and the expanding control of the state.” (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML. When Machiavelli was included on the first list of titles to be included in MLCE, Stein offered Lerner $50 to add the bibliography and make any changes he wanted in the introduction (Stein to Lerner, 27 January 1950). Lerner made a number of small changes, including the addition of two sentences within the last paragraph, which begins with the sentence “Machiavelli sought to distinguish the realm of what ought to be and the realm of what is.”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be realistic about methods in the politics of a democracy at home does not mean that you throw away all scruples, or accept the superior force of “reason of state,” or embrace the police-state crushing of constitutional liberties. To be realistic about the massing of power abroad in the economic and ideological struggle for the support of men and women throughout the world does not mean that you abandon the struggle for peace and for a constitutional imperium that can grow into a world republic.</p>

Designed by Joseph Blumenthal.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Nothing could be more timely than the publication at this moment of history of the two works which made Machiavelli both famous and infamous as a model for contemporary statesmen. *The Prince* and *The Discourses* have become required reading for an understanding of our daily newspaper headlines. These books have never before been printed in a single volume. The texts are complete and unabridged. An illuminating introduction is provided by Max Lerner of Williams College and until recently editor of *The Nation*. (*Spring 1940*)  \n\nRicci translation of *The Prince* originally published in London in World’s Classics, 1906; Vincent revision originally published in World’s Classics, 1935. Detmold translation of *The Discourses* originally published by James R. Osgood & Co., 1882, as part of Machiavelli’s *Historical, Political, and Diplomatic Writings*. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1940. *WR* 6 April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.  \n\nMachiavelli was included in the ML at Max Lerner’s recommendation. Lerner received \\$75 for the introduction, \\$25 more than the ML’s usual fee (Cerf to Linscott, 30 August 1940). The ML edition sold 8,721 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943 and 4,634 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it securely in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both of these periods.

(*Fall 1947*)  \n\n*Jacket A:* Non-pictorial in deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper; title and author in black on inset cream panel, other lettering in reverse on deep reddish orange background. Designed by Joseph Blumenthal.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Nothing could be more timely than the publication at this moment of history of the two works which made Machiavelli both famous and infamous as a model for contemporary statesmen. *The Prince* and *The Discourses* have become required reading for an understanding of our daily newspaper headlines. These books have never before been printed in a single volume. The texts are complete and unabridged. An illuminating introduction is provided by Max Lerner of Williams College and until recently editor of *The Nation*. (*Spring 1940*)  \n\nRicci translation of *The Prince* originally published in London in World’s Classics, 1906; Vincent revision originally published in World’s Classics, 1935. Detmold translation of *The Discourses* originally published by James R. Osgood & Co., 1882, as part of Machiavelli’s *Historical, Political, and Diplomatic Writings*. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1940. *WR* 6 April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.  \n\nMachiavelli was included in the ML at Max Lerner’s recommendation. Lerner received \\$75 for the introduction, \\$25 more than the ML’s usual fee (Cerf to Linscott, 30 August 1940). The ML edition sold 8,721 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943 and 4,634 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it securely in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both of these periods. Sales totaled 114,857 copies by spring 1958.  \n\n"
