<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Nothing could be more timely than the publication at this moment of
history of the two works which made Machiavelli both famous and
infamous as a model for contemporary statesmen. <em>The Prince</em> and <em>The
Discourses</em> have become required reading for an understanding of our
daily newspaper headlines. These books have never before been printed
in a single volume. The texts are complete and unabridged. An
illuminating introduction is provided by Max Lerner of Williams
College and until recently editor of <em>The Nation</em>. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ricci translation of <em>The Prince</em> originally published in London in
World’s Classics, 1906; Vincent revision originally published in World’s
Classics, 1935. Detmold translation of <em>The Discourses</em> originally
published by James R. Osgood &amp; Co., 1882, as part of Machiavelli’s
<em>Historical, Political, and Diplomatic Writings</em>. ML edition printed
from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1940. <em>WR</em> 6
April 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.</p>
<p>Machiavelli was included in the ML at Max Lerner’s recommendation.
Lerner received $75 for the introduction, $25 more than the ML’s usual
fee (Cerf to Linscott, 30 August 1940). The ML edition sold 8,721 copies
between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943 and 4,634 copies during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it securely in
the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both of these periods. Sales
totaled 114,857 copies by spring 1958.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> As 328a. Front flap with last sentence revised as follows: “An
illuminating introduction is provided by Max Lerner who traces the
career and thought of the first analyst of power and the uses to which
political domination can be put for aggression and the expanding control
of the state.” (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
<p>Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.
When Machiavelli was included on the first list of titles to be included
in MLCE, Stein offered Lerner $50 to add the bibliography and make any
changes he wanted in the introduction (Stein to Lerner, 27 January
1950). Lerner made a number of small changes, including the addition of
two sentences within the last paragraph, which begins with the sentence
“Machiavelli sought to distinguish the realm of what ought to be and the
realm of what is.”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be realistic about methods in the politics of a democracy at home
does not mean that you throw away all scruples, or accept the superior
force of “reason of state,” or embrace the police-state crushing of
constitutional liberties. To be realistic about the massing of power
abroad in the economic and ideological struggle for the support of men
and women throughout the world does not mean that you abandon the
struggle for peace and for a constitutional imperium that can grow
into a world republic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The appeal to conscience and the lyrical quality of Ludwig Lewisohn’s
writing make <em>The Island Within</em> his most notable novel. In it he
recounts the age-old plight of the man of integrity who must struggle
alone against the evil forces of prejudice and reaction. With an
unerring insight into the Jewish spirit, Mr. Lewisohn reveals the
nobility of a people reflected by one of its sons in the modern world.
The story he tells is rich in imagery and immensely rewarding to the
reader who demands fiction with meaning and emotion. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1928. ML edition (pp.
[1]–350) printed from Harper plates. Published April 1940. <em>WR</em> 6
April 1940. First and only printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall
1942.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy.
Lewisohn repeatedly urged Cerf to add <em>The Island Within</em> to the ML
although two of his books, <em>Up Stream</em> (128) and <em>The Story of American
Literature</em> (G43), were already in the series. Cerf confided to Cass
Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.”
He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP
STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place. Lewisohn
approved of this step with all the vociferousness at his command, which,
I need scarcely tell you, is quelquechose [<em>sic</em>]” (Cerf to Canfield,
Harper &amp; Bros., 12 October 1939).</p>
<p><em>The Island Within</em> was discontinued after two and a half years because
of poor sales. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the
remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.</p>
