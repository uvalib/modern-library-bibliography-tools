<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In selecting thirty-eight of the more than 600 stories written by O.
Henry, the editors of this volume first chose those honored
unanimously by anthologists and then added several of special
interest. The most exacting present-day standards were applied as the
final test of admission, with the result that this collection in the
truest sense represents America’s favorite story-teller at his mellow,
humorous and ironic best. It is with such stories as these that O.
Henry earned a permanent place beside the world’s great masters of the
short story. (<em>Spring 1945</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
The more than 600 stories written by O. Henry provided an
embarrassment of riches for the compilers of this volume. Within the
scope of a book of 338 pages, they were guided in their choice by the
most exacting present-day standards of admission. The final selection
of the thirty-eight stories in this collection offers for the reader’s
delight those tales honored almost unanimously by anthologists and
those which represent, in variety and balance, the best work of
America’s favorite story-teller. They are tales in his most mellow,
humorous and ironic moods. They give the full range and flavor of the
man, born William Sidney Porter, but known throughout the world as O.
Henry, one of the great masters of the short story. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Sun Dial Press, an imprint of Doubleday, Doran &amp;
Co. 1945. ML edition (pp. v–338) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates.
Published April 1945. <em>WR</em> 5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>The Best Short Stories of O. Henry</em> was a joint venture between the ML
and Doubleday, Doran. Van H. Cartmell, who collaborated with Cerf in the
1940s in editing four anthologies of plays that were published in ML
Giants, was an associate editor at Doubleday, Doran and editor-in-chief
of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary, Garden City Publishing Co. The Sun
Dial Press edition appeared first, followed shortly by the ML edition.
Doubleday, Doran made the plates, and the ML paid Doubleday a $2,000
advance (including $100 as a plate rental for five years) against
royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p>Ray Freiman, the Random House art director, authorized Sharp to use full
color in the jacket illustration. He also asked him to include a hansom
cab in the background (Freiman to Sharp, 14 December 1944).</p>
<p>The ML printed 20,000 jackets in February 1945. The first printing was
probably 20,000 as well. Royalties increased by 1971 to 14 cents a copy.
<em>The Best Short Stories of O. Henry</em> sold 3,850 copies during the
12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of
the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>
<p><em>The Best Short Stories of O. Henry</em> was shifted from ML 4 to ML 26 in
spring 1959 when <em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> (509) was published as
ML 4.</p>

It is with such stories as these that O.\n> Henry earned a permanent place beside the world’s great masters of the\n> short story. (*Spring 1945*)\n\n> Front flap revised:<br>\n> The more than 600 stories written by O. Henry provided an\n> embarrassment of riches for the compilers of this volume. Within the\n> scope of a book of 338 pages, they were guided in their choice by the\n> most exacting present-day standards of admission. The final selection\n> of the thirty-eight stories in this collection offers for the reader’s\n> delight those tales honored almost unanimously by anthologists and\n> those which represent, in variety and balance, the best work of\n> America’s favorite story-teller. They are tales in his most mellow,\n> humorous and ironic moods. They give the full range and flavor of the\n> man, born William Sidney Porter, but known throughout the world as O.\n> Henry, one of the great masters of the short story. (*Spring 1957*)\n\nOriginally published by Sun Dial Press, an imprint of Doubleday, Doran &\nCo. 1945. ML edition (pp. v–338) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates.\nPublished April 1945. *WR* 5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\n*The Best Short Stories of O. Henry* was a joint venture between the ML\nand Doubleday, Doran. Van H. Cartmell, who collaborated with Cerf in the\n1940s in editing four anthologies of plays that were published in ML\nGiants, was an associate editor at Doubleday, Doran and editor-in-chief\nof the Doubleday reprint subsidiary, Garden City Publishing Co. The Sun\nDial Press edition appeared first, followed shortly by the ML edition.\nDoubleday, Doran made the plates, and the ML paid Doubleday a $2,000\nadvance (including $100 as a plate rental for five years) against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\nRay Freiman, the Random House art director, authorized Sharp to use full\ncolor in the jacket illustration. He also asked him to include a hansom\ncab in the background (Freiman to Sharp, 14 December 1944).\n\nThe ML printed 20,000 jackets in February 1945. The first printing was\nprobably 20,000 as well. Royalties increased by 1971 to 14 cents a copy.\n*The Best Short Stories of O. Henry* sold 3,850 copies during the\n12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of\nthe second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n*The Best Short Stories of O.
