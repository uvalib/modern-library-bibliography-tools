<p><strong>J. D. SALINGER. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. 1958–1963. (ML 90)</strong></p>
<h4>504. First printing (1958)</h4>
<p>[4-line title within single rules] The | Catcher | in the | Rye |
[below frame] by J. D. SALINGER | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/E5.webp'>torchbearer E5</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | THE MODERN
LIBRARY · NEW YORK</p>
<p>Pp. [<em>6</em>], [1–2] 3–277 [278–282]. [1–9]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[<em>1</em>] half title; [<em>2</em>] blank; [<em>3</em>] title; [<em>4</em>] <em>First Modern
Library Edition</em> | <em>Copyright, 1945, 1946, 1951, by J. D. Salinger</em>;
[<em>5</em>] dedication; [<em>6</em>] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–277
text; [278–279] ML Giants list; [280–282] blank. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in black and strong brown (55) on coated white
paper with title and series in black and author in strong brown, all
against white background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This is the story of Holden Caulfield, a sixteen-year-old boy who, on
being dropped by his prep school, decides to spend three days in New
York before reporting home. The events of those three days and nights,
told in the boy’s own words, form more than a dramatic story. They are
the means by which Salinger skillfully portrays the thoughts and
feelings of a young boy standing alone and unsure on the threshold of
manhood.</p>
<p>“Mr. Salinger’s novel,” said Lewis Vogler in the <em>San Francisco
Chronicle</em>, “is funny, poignant, and in its implications, profound. It
is literature of a very high order.” The editors of the Modern Library
are pleased to include this novel, which is already widely regarded as
a twentieth-century classic. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1951. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–277) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published October 1958.
<em>WR</em> 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained but probably
around 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64.</p>
<p>The ML paid Little, Brown a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents
a copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958
that he wanted to publish <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> and Salinger’s <em>Nine
Stories</em> (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already
available in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at
all. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups
that patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8
January 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a
period of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no
photograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to
approve the jacket copy.</p>
<p>Printings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000
and 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and
10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962).

<p>Salinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for <em>Catcher in
the Rye</em> and <em>Nine Stories</em> not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’
termination notice for <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and indicated that the ML
would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to
Klopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to
Salinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important
books in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified
a manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000
copies of <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and over 37,000 copies of <em>Nine Stories</em>
and asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another
three years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963).</p>
<p>There is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in
July that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no
more printings of <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July
1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is
included in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer
1964 stock list.</p>
<p>The ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s
books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering
hope that Salinger might change his mind. <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and <em>Nine
Stories</em> were listed in <em>Publishers’ Trade List Annual</em> through 1965 and
continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through
1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new
titles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of <em>Catcher in
the Rye</em>, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when <em>Four
Contemporary French Plays</em> (598) was published as ML 90.</p>

(*Fall 1958*)\n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in black and strong brown (55) on coated white\npaper with title and series in black and author in strong brown, all\nagainst white background.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> This is the story of Holden Caulfield, a sixteen-year-old boy who, on\n> being dropped by his prep school, decides to spend three days in New\n> York before reporting home. The events of those three days and nights,\n> told in the boy’s own words, form more than a dramatic story. They are\n> the means by which Salinger skillfully portrays the thoughts and\n> feelings of a young boy standing alone and unsure on the threshold of\n> manhood.\n>\n> “Mr. Salinger’s novel,” said Lewis Vogler in the *San Francisco\n> Chronicle*, “is funny, poignant, and in its implications, profound. It\n> is literature of a very high order.” The editors of the Modern Library\n> are pleased to include this novel, which is already widely regarded as\n> a twentieth-century classic. (*Fall 1958*)\n\nOriginally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1951. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–277) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published October 1958.\n*WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained but probably\naround 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64.\n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958\nthat he wanted to publish *The Catcher in the Rye* and Salinger’s *Nine\nStories* (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already\navailable in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at\nall. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups\nthat patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8\nJanuary 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a\nperiod of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no\nphotograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to\napprove the jacket copy.\n\nPrintings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000\nand 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and\n10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962).\nIn the following table ML sales of *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* chart Salinger’s popularity with precision.\n\nTable: ML sales of Salinger’s *Cather in the Rye* and *Nine Stories*,\n1958–63\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>CATCHER IN THE RYE</td>\n<td>NINE STORIES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Year ending</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/59</td>\n<td>7,171</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/60</td>\n<td>9,915</td>\n<td>7,966</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/61</td>\n<td>9,935</td>\n<td>4,680</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/62</td>\n<td>23,963</td>\n<td>14,142</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/63</td>\n<td>14,014</td>\n<td>10,478</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>TOTAL</td>\n<td>64,998</td>\n<td>37,266</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSalinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for *Catcher in\nthe Rye* and *Nine Stories* not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’\ntermination notice for *Catcher in the Rye* and indicated that the ML\nwould have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to\nSalinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important\nbooks in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified\na manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000\ncopies of *Catcher in the Rye* and over 37,000 copies of *Nine Stories*\nand asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another\nthree years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963).\n\nThere is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in\nJuly that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no\nmore printings of *Catcher in the Rye* (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July\n1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is\nincluded in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer\n1964 stock list.\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of *Catcher in\nthe Rye*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when *Four\nContemporary French Plays* (598) was published as ML 90.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSalinger*, Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516",
