<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few writers, if indeed any, surpass Voltaire in versatility and
enduring vitality. Novelist, poet, dramatist, literary critic,
philosopher, historian, scientist, political essayist: Voltaire was
all these—and always with brilliance of wit and lucidity of style.</p>
<p>The most representative figure of the Age of Enlightenment, he remains
after two centuries an abundant fountainhead of good sense and of
memorable enjoyment to every reader. This immortal talent is richly
represented in this volume, edited by Haskell M. Block of the
University of Wisconsin with a stimulating introduction on the
importance of Voltaire to our own times. (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding Voltaire, <em>Candide</em> (1918: 46).
Published May 1956. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1956. First printing: Probably 5,000
copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1985.</p>
<p>“I have attempted to provide an indication of Voltaire’s range and
complexity by selecting those works which have most clearly become of a
vital part of our intellectual and artistic heritage. . . . The text of
this edition has been prepared in the hope of making some improvement
over previous English versions. All of the selections are complete.
There are no excerpts of letters or parts of chapters. . . . It is hoped
that the translations in this collection will help to make a beginning
toward an accurate edition of Voltaire in English. In every section of
the volume I have provided new translations wherever they were
necessary. I should add that the translations from Voltaire’s
<em>Notebooks</em> are the first from that work to appear in an English
edition. . . . Where older translations have been used, they have been
thoroughly revised. In particular, for all of the fiction except
<em>Candide</em>, I have modernized the version of Robert Bruce Boswell. The
translation of <em>Candide</em> is by Richard Aldington. I am especially
grateful to Martyn P. Pollack for the selections from his excellent
version of <em>The Age of Louis XIV</em>, and to Floyd Gray for his assistance
in the translating of Voltaire’s correspondence.” (Editorial Note, pp.
xxi–xxii)</p>
<p>The chapters of <em>Candide</em>, like those in the 1930 ML edition (46.2), are
set as single paragraphs, following the 1928 Random House limited
edition of <em>Candide</em>.</p>
<p>Sales totaled 14,352 copies by spring 1958.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The highly unusual story of a young man booted from Paradise,
<em>Candide</em> is Voltaire’s most famous novel as well as a scorching
indictment of the philosophy of Liebnitz [<em>sic</em>], which was summed
up by Voltaire in the thought: “All is for the best in this best of
all possible worlds.” Candide’s tutor, the philosophic Dr. Pangloss,
is the embodiment of this unlikely theory, maintaining it in spite of
the most blatant evidence to the contrary. The young Candide is
expelled from the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh for making love to the
Baron’s daughter, Cunégonde; and thereafter he, Pangloss and Cunégonde
embark on what develops into a long series of adventures. Sometimes
together, usually apart, in various corners of the earth, they endure
a brutal succession of the most unfair and calamitous events
conceivable. Eventually they settle down together on a little farm.
Candide marries Cunégonde, now grown ugly as a radish, and tells
himself often, “We must cultivate our garden.”</p>
