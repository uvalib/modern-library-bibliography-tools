<em>May</em> 6, 1869.; [424] blank; [425–430] ML list. (<em>Fall 1944</em>)
<em>Note:</em> Based on the “Weekly Record” listing in <em>Publishers’ Weekly</em> the
ML edition of <em>Two Years before the Mast</em> appears to have been published
in August 1945. There was a second printing in fall 1945 with the 1945
copyright date on the verso of the title page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> Pagination and collation as 381a. Contents as 381a except:
[iv] Copyright, 1936, by Random House, Inc. (<em>Fall 1945</em>) <em>Note:</em>
The correction in the copyright date was made because Hart’s
introduction was initially written for the limited edition of <em>Two
Years before the Mast</em> printed by the Grabhorn Press in San Francisco
and published by Random House in 1936.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>A:</em> Pictorial in dark blue (183) and medium gray (264) on
coated cream paper with inset multi-color illustration adapted from the
poster for the 1946 film version starring Alan Ladd and Brian Donlevy;
lettering in dark blue on medium gray panels above and below
illustration; all surrounded by dark blue background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The test of time by which classics are proved has certainly been
applied to Richard Henry Dana’s <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em>, for it is
now just over one hundred years since it was first published. During
that century it has constantly risen in the admiration of succeeding
generations of readers, and today is as revered as a masterpiece of
the literature of the sea as it ever has been in all its long history.
It takes an honored place in the Modern Library series, introduced by
James Hart of Harvard University. (<em>Spring 1945</em>) <em>Note:</em> There was a
second printing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B1:</em> Pictorial on cream paper in light blue (181), light yellow
86), light orange yellow (70) and black with inset illustration of
clipper ship at dock and title and author in reverse against light blue
background and series in black. Front flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1946</em>)
Flap: “James D. Hart of the University of California” fall 1948; “of
Harvard University” fall 1954 sans serif type, later corrected (F55)</p>
<p>ML edition based on the text of the limited edition of 1,000 copies
printed by Edwin and Robert Grabhorn in San Francisco and published by
Random House, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published summer 1945 (publication originally announced for
fall 1944 and then for spring 1945). <em>WR</em> 4 August 1945. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>James D. Hart, the author of the Foreword, had suggested a ML edition of
<em>Two Years before the Mast</em> in 1935 and indicated that it would have a
steady sale to schools and colleges (Hart to Cerf, 19 February 1935).
Later that year Cerf offered Hart $75 to write an introduction to the
Grabhorn Press edition with the understanding that the introduction
could also be used in due course in a ML edition (Cerf to Hart, 12
November 1935). Hart also advised Edwin and Robert Grabhorn about the
best edition to use as a copy-text when setting their edition.</p>
<p>Hart stated in his introduction to the Grabhorn edition, “The text for
this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life, and to it is
added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote ‘twenty-four years after.’
To this have been added the concluding chapter of the first edition,
omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the
original purpose of his account” (p. [xiv]). The second sentence is
altered in ML ed. as follows: “To this have been added the preface and
epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but
interesting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p.
[xiv]). The preface appears in both the Grabhorn and ML editions; the
epilogue (titled “Concluding Memorandum” in the Grabhorn edition)
appears on pp. 413–23 of the ML edition as part of “Twenty-four Years
After.” The concluding chapter referred to in Hart’s introduction to the
Grabhorn edition is omitted from 381a. The ML edition also omitted the
penultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding
chapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided
incorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the
events as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I
shall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have
been suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4).</p>
<p>The film of <em>Two Years before the Mast</em> starring Alan Ladd was released
by Paramount Pictures in April 1945. It is possible that publication of
the ML edition was postponed to coincide with the release of the film.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381a reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his
life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote
“twenty-four years after.” To this have been added the preface and the
epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but
interesting as showing the original purpose of his account. (p. xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Two Years before the Mast</em> was not among the 100 best-selling titles in
the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<h4>381b. “Concluding Chapter” added (1954)</h4>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B2:</em> As 381a jacket B except flap text as jacket B except for
last sentence. (<em>Fall 1954</em>) <em>Note:</em> The ML began using sans serif type
on the flaps and back panel of jackets in fall 1953. When the jacket for
<em>Two Years before the Mast</em> was reset in sans serif type, the ML’s
printers appear to have copied the flap text from jacket A, and the last
sentence reverts to “James D. Hart of Harvard University.” (<em>Fall
1954</em>).</p>
<p><em>Jacket B3:</em> As jacket B2 with flap text corrected to “James D. Hart of
the University of California.” (<em>Fall 1955</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket B4</em>: As jacket B3 except on coated white paper. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
<p>The last paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381b is revised as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his
life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote
“twenty-four years after.” As preface and epilogue there have been
appended the original opening of Chapter I and the Concluding Chapter
of the first edition. These sections were omitted in later revisions
but they have great value in giving further insight into the purposes
of Dana’s book. (p. xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earliest printing examined with the Concluding Chapter (pp. 387–406)
has a fall 1954 jacket, but the Concluding Chapter may have been added
earlier.</p>

First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nJames D. Hart, the author of the Foreword, had suggested a ML edition of\n*Two Years before the Mast* in 1935 and indicated that it would have a\nsteady sale to schools and colleges (Hart to Cerf, 19 February 1935).\nLater that year Cerf offered Hart $75 to write an introduction to the\nGrabhorn Press edition with the understanding that the introduction\ncould also be used in due course in a ML edition (Cerf to Hart, 12\nNovember 1935). Hart also advised Edwin and Robert Grabhorn about the\nbest edition to use as a copy-text when setting their edition.\n\nHart stated in his introduction to the Grabhorn edition, “The text for\nthis edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life, and to it is\nadded the chapter of reminiscences he wrote ‘twenty-four years after.’\nTo this have been added the concluding chapter of the first edition,\nomitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the\noriginal purpose of his account” (p. \\[xiv\\]). The second sentence is\naltered in ML ed. as follows: “To this have been added the preface and\nepilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but\ninteresting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p.\n\\[xiv\\]). The preface appears in both the Grabhorn and ML editions; the\nepilogue (titled “Concluding Memorandum” in the Grabhorn edition)\nappears on pp. 413–23 of the ML edition as part of “Twenty-four Years\nAfter.” The concluding chapter referred to in Hart’s introduction to the\nGrabhorn edition is omitted from 381a. The ML edition also omitted the\npenultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding\nchapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided\nincorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the\nevents as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I\nshall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have\nbeen suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4).\n\nThe film of *Two Years before the Mast* starring Alan Ladd was released\nby Paramount Pictures in April 1945. It is possible that publication of\nthe ML edition was postponed to coincide with the release of the film.\n\nThe last paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381a reads as follows:\n\n> The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his\n> life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote\n> “twenty-four years after.” To this have been added the preface and the\n> epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but\n> interesting as showing the original purpose of his account.
