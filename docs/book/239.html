<h4>239a. First printing (1932)</h4>

<p>[i] half title; [ii] frontispiece; [iii] title; [iv] A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA (THE INNOCENT VOYAGE) | <em>Copyright,</em> 1929, <em>by</em> RICHARD HUGHES | [short double rule] | <em>Introduction Copyright,</em> 1932, <em>by</em> THE MODERN | LIBRARY, INC. | [short double rule] | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | 1932; v–xxii <em>Preface</em> signed p. xxii: <span class="smallcaps">Isabel Paterson</span>. | <span class="smallcaps">New York</span>, <em>January</em>, 1932.; ix ILLUSTRATIONS; [x] blank; 1–399 text with illustrations facing pp. 136, 234, 312; [400–402] blank.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in strong green (141) and black on cream paper depicting a schooner sailing into a lagoon; borders in strong green, lettering in black. Signed: L. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> A band of pirates captures a vessel bound for England that contains a miscellaneous cargo—including a group of children who have been driven from their home by a West Indian hurricane. The difficulties encountered by the well-meaning buccaneers with these incredible children provide the frame-work for one of the most unusual books in the Modern Library series—a shocking, nerve-tingling story that the reader will never forget. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. as <em>The Innocent Voyage</em> by Harper &amp; Bros., 1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July 1932. <em>WR</em> 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1958.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated interest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his personal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself have bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros., 5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk about a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he stated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in the Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and I have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the author’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint contract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a warm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the Modern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is released” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).</p>
<p>When the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed Klopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the Readers Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s president, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was available (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and convinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail order sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would like to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the option to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer to Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty remained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed in 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but without an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the ML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club edition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).</p>
<p>In 1956 the College Department of Harper &amp; Bros. expressed interest in adding <em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> and Richard Wright’s <em>Native Son</em> (349) to the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper director of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the ML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had textbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer replied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition from an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department wants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the Modern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956).</p>
<p><em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Signed: L. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> A band of pirates captures a vessel bound for England that contains a miscellaneous cargo—including a group of children who have been driven from their home by a West Indian hurricane. The difficulties encountered by the well-meaning buccaneers with these incredible children provide the frame-work for one of the most unusual books in the Modern Library series—a shocking, nerve-tingling story that the reader will never forget. (*Spring 1937*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros., 1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July 1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1958.  \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated interest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his personal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself have bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk about a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he stated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in the Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and I have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the author’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint contract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a warm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the Modern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is released” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).  \n\nWhen the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed Klopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the Readers Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s president, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was available (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and convinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail order sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would like to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the option to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer to Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty remained from the \\$750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed in 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but without an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the ML could pay \\$250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club edition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).  \n\nIn 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in adding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349) to the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper director of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the ML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had textbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer replied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition from an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department wants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the Modern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956).  \n\n*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 239b.
