<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Non-pictorial on coated white paper with three panels from
top to foot in strong brown (55), black and grayish yellow green (122)
with lettering in reverse, strong brown and black with ML number “4” on
backstrip.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This dictionary has been prepared with the general reader specifically
in mind. It provides reliable, clear, and concise information on
practically all the words he is likely to look up—information on
spelling, hyphenation, pronunciation, meaning, inflected forms, and
numerous other aspects of the English language.</p>
<p><em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> is based on <em>The American College
Dictionary</em>, widely acclaimed as the most distinguished dictionary of
its kind ever published. New and up to date, The Modern Library
Dictionary is an indispensable and authoritative ready-reference work.</p>
<p>Unlike most old-fashioned dictionaries, this book is easily used and
easily understood. Durably bound, it will readily absorb the constant
use which its compact and handy size invites. (<em>Spring 1959)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B</em>: As jacket A with ML number “1” on backstrip. (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML dictionary based on <em>The American College Dictionary</em>,
published by Random House in 1947. Published February 1959. <em>WR</em> 23
February 1959. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Cerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as
1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a
duplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William
Targ, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May
1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the <em>American College
Dictionary</em> in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By
deleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the
content to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the
dictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the
<em>American College Dictionary</em> by 50 percent would require making much
sharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a
Giant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with <em>The
Concise Oxford Dictionary</em>, the Funk and Wagnalls <em>Desk Standard
Dictionary</em>, and the <em>Winston Advanced Dictionary</em> (School Edition). He
estimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and
that editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott,
18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans
to publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. <em>The</em> <em>Modern
Library Dictionary</em> (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000
entries.</p>
<p><em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall
1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A,
1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because
new business machines acquired by Random House could not handle
number-letter combinations. Copies of <em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em>
that remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number
“1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.</p>
<p>The <em>First</em> statement on the verso of the title page appears to have
been removed on all subsequent printings.</p>

(*Fall 1959*)\n\nOriginal ML dictionary based on *The American College Dictionary*,\npublished by Random House in 1947. Published February 1959. *WR* 23\nFebruary 1959. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as\n1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a\nduplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William\nTarg, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May\n1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the *American College\nDictionary* in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By\ndeleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the\ncontent to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the\ndictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the\n*American College Dictionary* by 50 percent would require making much\nsharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a\nGiant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with *The\nConcise Oxford Dictionary*, the Funk and Wagnalls *Desk Standard\nDictionary*, and the *Winston Advanced Dictionary* (School Edition). He\nestimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and\nthat editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott,\n18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans\nto publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. *The* *Modern\nLibrary Dictionary* (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000\nentries.\n\n*The Modern Library Dictionary* was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall\n1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A,\n1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because\nnew business machines acquired by Random House could not handle\nnumber-letter combinations. Copies of *The Modern Library Dictionary*\nthat remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number\n“1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.\n\nThe *First* statement on the verso of the title page appears to have\nbeen removed on all subsequent printings.",
