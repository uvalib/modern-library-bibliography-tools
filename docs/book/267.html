<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The selection of a detective story for inclusion in the Modern Library
series provided an embarrassment of riches. Yet there was neither
hesitation nor reservation in the choice of <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. Its
authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and
sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and
picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and
resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell
Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which
Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition
(pp. [v], [xi]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934.
<em>WR</em> 31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall
1949.</p>
<p>Hammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people
who served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had
no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the
private detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite
a few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your
private detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my
colleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes
manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of
himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in
contact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp.
viii–ix).</p>
<p><em>The Maltese Falcon</em> was originally published as a five-part serial
(September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazine <em>Black Mask</em>. “The
book was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two
thousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the
changes were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to
have been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).</p>
<p>There were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and
fifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (<em>The Maltese
Falcon</em>, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title
page verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first
in the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been
examined.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version
starring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period.
The 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears
to have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued
in 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph
C. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950). The ML remaindered 4,774 copies through
the Harlem Book Co in 1952.</p>

Yet there was neither\n> hesitation nor reservation in the choice of *The Maltese Falcon*. Its\n> authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and\n> sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and\n> picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and\n> resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell\n> Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which\n> Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\], \\[xi\\]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934.\n*WR* 31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall\n1949.\n\nHammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people\nwho served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had\nno original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the\nprivate detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite\na few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your\nprivate detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my\ncolleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes\nmanner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of\nhimself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in\ncontact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp.\nviii–ix).\n\n*The Maltese Falcon* was originally published as a five-part serial\n(September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazine *Black Mask*. “The\nbook was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two\nthousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the\nchanges were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to\nhave been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).\n\nThere were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and\nfifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (*The Maltese\nFalcon*, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title\npage verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first\nin the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been\nexamined.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version\nstarring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period.\nThe 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears\nto have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued\nin 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph\nC. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950). The ML remaindered 4,774 copies through\nthe Harlem Book Co in 1952.\n\n#### 267b.
