<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The elemental strength and simplicity of <em>Growth of the Soil</em> won for
its author the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921 and for itself a
permanent place among the great novels of our century. An epic of the
soil, it portrays the alliance between Man and Nature in a story
notable for its magnitude and compassion. The eternal struggle for the
physical means of life becomes a revelation of heroism and profound
spiritual meaning. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worster translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by
Alfred A. Knopf, 1921. ML edition (pp. [5]–304; [5]–276) printed
from Knopf plates. Published February 1935. <em>WR</em> 9 March 1935. First
printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1951.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.
The ML secured reprint rights in December 1934 after offers in 1932 and
1933 had been rejected. Cerf told Knopf that <em>Growth of the Soil</em> would
make a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he
exclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!”
(Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The
royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when
the ML increased the list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June
1947). <em>Growth of the Soil</em> sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and
Giant titles in terms of sales.</p>

Cerf told Knopf that *Growth of the Soil* would\nmake a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he\nexclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!”\n(Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The\nroyalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when\nthe ML increased the list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June\n1947). *Growth of the Soil* sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles in terms of sales.\n\n#### 279b.

An epic of the\n> soil, it portrays the alliance between Man and Nature in a story\n> notable for its magnitude and compassion. The eternal struggle for the\n> physical means of life becomes a revelation of heroism and profound\n> spiritual meaning. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nWorster translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by\nAlfred A. Knopf, 1921. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–304; \\[5\\]–276) printed\nfrom Knopf plates. Published February 1935. *WR* 9 March 1935. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1951.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.\nThe ML secured reprint rights in December 1934 after offers in 1932 and\n1933 had been rejected. Cerf told Knopf that *Growth of the Soil* would\nmake a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he\nexclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!”\n(Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The\nroyalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when\nthe ML increased the list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June\n1947). *Growth of the Soil* sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles in terms of sales.\n\n"
