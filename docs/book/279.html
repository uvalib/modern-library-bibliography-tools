<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The elemental strength and simplicity of <em>Growth of the Soil</em> won for its author the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921 and for itself a permanent place among the great novels of our century. An epic of the soil, it portrays the alliance between Man and Nature in a story notable for its magnitude and compassion. The eternal struggle for the physical means of life becomes a revelation of heroism and profound spiritual meaning. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worster translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Alfred A. Knopf, 1921. ML edition (pp. [5]–304; [5]–276) printed from Knopf plates. Published February 1935. <em>WR</em> 9 March 1935. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1951.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The ML secured reprint rights in December 1934 after offers in 1932 and 1933 had been rejected. Cerf told Knopf that <em>Growth of the Soil</em> would make a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he exclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!” (Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when the ML increased the list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947). <em>Growth of the Soil</em> sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.</p>

Signed: illegible.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> The elemental strength and simplicity of *Growth of the Soil* won for its author the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921 and for itself a permanent place among the great novels of our century. An epic of the soil, it portrays the alliance between Man and Nature in a story notable for its magnitude and compassion. The eternal struggle for the physical means of life becomes a revelation of heroism and profound spiritual meaning. (*Spring 1935*)   \n\nWorster translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Alfred A. Knopf, 1921. ML edition (pp. [5]–304; [5]–276) printed from Knopf plates. Published February 1935. *WR* 9 March 1935. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1951.   \n\nThe ML paid Knopf a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The ML secured reprint rights in December 1934 after offers in 1932 and 1933 had been rejected. Cerf told Knopf that *Growth of the Soil* would make a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he exclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!” (Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when the ML increased the list price to \\$1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947). *Growth of the Soil* sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.   \n\n#### 279b.

Signed: illegible.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> The elemental strength and simplicity of *Growth of the Soil* won for its author the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921 and for itself a permanent place among the great novels of our century. An epic of the soil, it portrays the alliance between Man and Nature in a story notable for its magnitude and compassion. The eternal struggle for the physical means of life becomes a revelation of heroism and profound spiritual meaning. (*Spring 1935*)   \n\nWorster translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Alfred A. Knopf, 1921. ML edition (pp. [5]–304; [5]–276) printed from Knopf plates. Published February 1935. *WR* 9 March 1935. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1951.   \n\nThe ML paid Knopf a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The ML secured reprint rights in December 1934 after offers in 1932 and 1933 had been rejected. Cerf told Knopf that *Growth of the Soil* would make a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he exclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!” (Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when the ML increased the list price to \\$1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947). *Growth of the Soil* sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.   \n\n"
