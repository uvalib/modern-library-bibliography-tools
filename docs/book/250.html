<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in dark yellowish green (137) and black on light
orange yellow paper with inset illustration (inspired by Du Maurier’s
illustration on p. 245) of a man and woman clasping hands in an arbor;
borders in dark yellowish green, title in reverse against inset
illustration, other lettering in black. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations.
Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second
only to the furore created by his own <em>Trilby</em>. Then as a play, it has
been, since 1915, a perennial favorite. As an opera, with a score by
Deems Taylor, it found a prominent place in the repertory of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, and, finally as a cinema, it has reached
countless thousands of people. In its original form, it remains a book
of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1891. New
bibliographical edition published by Harper &amp; Brothers with a 1919
copyright date; the new edition was probably published in the 1920s. ML
edition (pp. [ii], v–vii, [1]–416) printed from plates of the later
Harper edition. Published December 1932. <em>WR</em> 31 December 1932. First
printing: 7,450 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p>The royalties that the ML paid to Harper &amp; Brothers were based on sales,
in contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number
of copies printed. <em>Peter Ibbetson</em> was one of the few books in the ML
printed on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary
because of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first
printing may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing
of 8,000 copies and received 7,450.</p>
<p>When the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s
that it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations
and asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp;
Bros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the
wood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the
plates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s
balloon-cloth format.</p>
<p><em>Peter Ibbetson</em> sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations.\n> Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second\n> only to the furore created by his own *Trilby*. Then as a play, it has\n> been, since 1915, a perennial favorite. As an opera, with a score by\n> Deems Taylor, it found a prominent place in the repertory of the\n> Metropolitan Opera Company, and, finally as a cinema, it has reached\n> countless thousands of people. In its original form, it remains a book\n> of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (*Spring 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1891. New\nbibliographical edition published by Harper & Brothers with a 1919\ncopyright date; the new edition was probably published in the 1920s. ML\nedition (pp. \\[ii\\], v–vii, \\[1\\]–416) printed from plates of the later\nHarper edition. Published December 1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First\nprinting: 7,450 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.\n\nThe royalties that the ML paid to Harper & Brothers were based on sales,\nin contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number\nof copies printed. *Peter Ibbetson* was one of the few books in the ML\nprinted on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary\nbecause of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first\nprinting may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing\nof 8,000 copies and received 7,450.\n\nWhen the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s\nthat it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations\nand asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper &\nBros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the\nwood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the\nplates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s\nballoon-cloth format.\n\n*Peter Ibbetson* sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 250b.
