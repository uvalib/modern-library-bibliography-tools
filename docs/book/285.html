<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The winner of the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature, Thomas Mann, stands
pre-eminent among living writers. His fame rests chiefly on two
novels, <em>The Magic Mountain</em> and <em>Buddenbrooks</em>. For more than three
years, <em>The Magic Mountain</em> (#200) has maintained its position as one
of the five best sellers on the Modern Library list. With the addition
of <em>Buddenbrooks</em> to the series, it is safe to predict that it will
take rank with its illustrious predecessor as a book of immense
popular appeal. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by
Alfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>]–389; [1]–359) printed
from Knopf plates. Published October 1935. <em>WR</em> 2 November 1935. First
printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third
printings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The
reprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an
eighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200
advance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining
copies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of
Knopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies
(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing
under the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML
reported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the
bindery and that <em>Buddenbrooks</em> would be completely out of stock within
a few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty
statement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting
sales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance.</p>

(*Fall 1935*)\n\nLowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by\nAlfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\]–389; \\[1\\]–359) printed\nfrom Knopf plates. Published October 1935. *WR* 2 November 1935. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third\nprintings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The\nreprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an\neighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200\nadvance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining\ncopies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of\nKnopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies\n(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing\nunder the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML\nreported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the\nbindery and that *Buddenbrooks* would be completely out of stock within\na few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty\nstatement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting\nsales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance.",

His fame rests chiefly on two\n> novels, *The Magic Mountain* and *Buddenbrooks*. For more than three\n> years, *The Magic Mountain* (#200) has maintained its position as one\n> of the five best sellers on the Modern Library list. With the addition\n> of *Buddenbrooks* to the series, it is safe to predict that it will\n> take rank with its illustrious predecessor as a book of immense\n> popular appeal. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nLowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by\nAlfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\]–389; \\[1\\]–359) printed\nfrom Knopf plates. Published October 1935. *WR* 2 November 1935. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third\nprintings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The\nreprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an\neighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200\nadvance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining\ncopies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of\nKnopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies\n(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing\nunder the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML\nreported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the\nbindery and that *Buddenbrooks* would be completely out of stock within\na few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty\nstatement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting\nsales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance."
