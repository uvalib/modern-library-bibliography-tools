<p><em>Jacket A1:</em> Pictorial in deep blue (179), moderate blue (182), light
bluish gray (190), dark gray (266) and black on coated white paper

with a shoreline in the distance; lettering in black. Spine panel in
deep blue with lettering in reverse. Designed by Paul Galdone, July
1937; unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The mastery with which Virginia Woolf has achieved such novels and
books of essays as <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> (No. 96), <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, <em>The
Common Reader</em> and <em>A Room of One’s Own</em> has at last brought her the
public tribute of having a national best-seller in <em>The Years</em>. <em>To
the Lighthouse</em> is in Mrs. Woolf’s best vein, quiet [<em>sic</em>]
evocative, full of the interplay of human emotion. In addition, its
autobiographical <em>note</em> throws light upon her own family, one of the
most illustrious in England. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1927. ML edition
(pp. [5]–310) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published September
1937. <em>WR</em> 25 September 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued
fall 1948.</p>
<p>Total ML sales of <em>To the Lighthouse</em> were 38,000 copies (Kirkpatrick,
<em>Virginia Woolf</em>, p. 31). <em>To the Lighthouse</em> sold 3,203 copies during
the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the
fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> (168) sold 4,271
copies during the same period.</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint
series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college
market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint
contracts for <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>, and seven other
titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne
Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML,
18 May 1948). At that time the ML had only a few copies of <em>To the
Lighthouse</em> in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take two months
for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June and 28 June 1948).</p>

In addition, its\n> autobiographical *note* throws light upon her own family, one of the\n> most illustrious in England. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1927. ML edition\n(pp. \\[5\\]–310) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published September\n1937. *WR* 25 September 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued\nfall 1948.\n\nTotal ML sales of *To the Lighthouse* were 38,000 copies (Kirkpatrick,\n*Virginia Woolf*, p. 31). *To the Lighthouse* sold 3,203 copies during\nthe eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the\nfourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Mrs. Dalloway* (168) sold 4,271\ncopies during the same period.\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college\nmarket. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint\ncontracts for *To the Lighthouse*, *Mrs. Dalloway*, and seven other\ntitles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne\nPorter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML,\n18 May 1948). At that time the ML had only a few copies of *To the\nLighthouse* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take two months\nfor the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June and 28 June 1948).\n\n#### 306b.
