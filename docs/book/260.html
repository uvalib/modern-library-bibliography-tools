THIRD EDITION signed: CURRER BELL. | <em>April</em> 13<em>th,</em> 1848.; 1–486 text;
[487–488] blank.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in vivid green (139) and black on pale yellowish
green paper depicting Jane Eyre holding cut flowers in her arms with a
country house in the background; borders in vivid green, lettering in
black. Signed: Loederer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In her introduction to her sister’s novel, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>,
Charlotte Brontë wrote: “The writer who possesses the creative gift
owns something that strangely wills and works for itself.” This
observation has an especial application to her own <em>Jane Eyre</em>, for it
emphasizes the reasons for the vitality and individuality of one of
the most highly cherished treasures in our literature. Since it is
partially autobiographical, the poignancy of <em>Jane Eyre</em> is linked to
the deathless interest and the heart rending pathos of the lives of
the Brontës. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
August 1933. <em>WR</em> 2 September 1933. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Jane Eyre</em> was the first ML book to include descriptive text about the
work on the jacket flap. Descriptive text about each ML title appeared
on the front panel of the jacket from May 1917 through spring 1928. For
the next five years (fall 1928–July 1933) ML jackets included
information about the series as a whole on the front flap but nothing
specifically about individual works. Saxe Commins, who joined Random
House as editor in July 1933, wrote the flap text for <em>Jane Eyre</em> and
subsequently published ML titles. As jackets of older ML titles were
reprinted, he provided flap text about those works as well.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Jane Eyre</em> increased substantially during the Second World
War. There were nineteen printings between 1933 and early 1944 for a
total of 37,000 copies. Of these, 10,453 copies were sold during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing <em>Jane Eyre</em> in the
first quarter of ML and Giant titles, just above Thackeray’s <em>Vanity
Fair</em>. It sold 3,502 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML
and Giant titles. <em>Vanity Fair</em>, with sales of 5,390 copies, retained a
solid position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

<p>The ML reset the text for the Illustrated ML (IML 8) and subsequently
used the plates for regular ML printings. The full page illustrations in
Illustrated Modern Library printings are omitted, but two of Edward A.
Wilson’s drawings are retained—the decorative vignette of two birds at
the beginning of the Preface (p. v) and the illustration of a barren
tree at the head of Chapter One (p. 3).</p>
<p>The first word or two of each chapter is set in Lilith, a decorated
typeface designed by Lucian Bernhard in 1930. Hutchings describes it as
a “twentieth century parody of Victorian decorated typefaces” and “a
pastiche of some or the more notable design features of the 1840–50
decade. The collared main-strokes to the capitals, bifurcated terminals,
horizontal hatching, and formalized shadow effect are characteristic of
the period, although the swash forms of the capitals and the inclusion
of lower-case were then exceptional” (<em>Manual of Decorated Typefaces</em>,
p. 54).</p>

Signed: Loederer.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> In her introduction to her sister’s novel, *Wuthering Heights*,\n> Charlotte Brontë wrote: “The writer who possesses the creative gift\n> owns something that strangely wills and works for itself.” This\n> observation has an especial application to her own *Jane Eyre*, for it\n> emphasizes the reasons for the vitality and individuality of one of\n> the most highly cherished treasures in our literature. Since it is\n> partially autobiographical, the poignancy of *Jane Eyre* is linked to\n> the deathless interest and the heart rending pathos of the lives of\n> the Brontës. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nAugust 1933. *WR* 2 September 1933. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\n*Jane Eyre* was the first ML book to include descriptive text about the\nwork on the jacket flap. Descriptive text about each ML title appeared\non the front panel of the jacket from May 1917 through spring 1928. For\nthe next five years (fall 1928–July 1933) ML jackets included\ninformation about the series as a whole on the front flap but nothing\nspecifically about individual works. Saxe Commins, who joined Random\nHouse as editor in July 1933, wrote the flap text for *Jane Eyre* and\nsubsequently published ML titles. As jackets of older ML titles were\nreprinted, he provided flap text about those works as well.\n\nSales of *Jane Eyre* increased substantially during the Second World\nWar. There were nineteen printings between 1933 and early 1944 for a\ntotal of 37,000 copies. Of these, 10,453 copies were sold during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing *Jane Eyre* in the\nfirst quarter of ML and Giant titles, just above Thackeray’s *Vanity\nFair*. It sold 3,502 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML\nand Giant titles. *Vanity Fair*, with sales of 5,390 copies, retained a\nsolid position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n#### 260.1b.

(*Fall 1946*)\n\n*Jacket:* As 260.1b. (*Fall 1946*)\n\nThe ML reset the text for the Illustrated ML (IML 8) and subsequently\nused the plates for regular ML printings. The full page illustrations in\nIllustrated Modern Library printings are omitted, but two of Edward A.\nWilson’s drawings are retained—the decorative vignette of two birds at\nthe beginning of the Preface (p. v) and the illustration of a barren\ntree at the head of Chapter One (p. 3).\n\nThe first word or two of each chapter is set in Lilith, a decorated\ntypeface designed by Lucian Bernhard in 1930. Hutchings describes it as\na “twentieth century parody of Victorian decorated typefaces” and “a\npastiche of some or the more notable design features of the 1840–50\ndecade. The collared main-strokes to the capitals, bifurcated terminals,\nhorizontal hatching, and formalized shadow effect are characteristic of\nthe period, although the swash forms of the capitals and the inclusion\nof lower-case were then exceptional” (*Manual of Decorated Typefaces*,\np. 54).\n\n#### 260.2b.
