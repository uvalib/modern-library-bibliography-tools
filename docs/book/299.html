<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The award of the 1936 Nobel Prize for Literature to Eugene O’Neill
brings new distinction to the foremost playwright of the world. In
observance of the event, the Modern Library has the honor to issue
three of his best-known plays in a single volume. <em>The Emperor Jones</em>,
<em>Anna Christie</em> and <em>The Hairy Ape</em> represent the work by which Eugene
O’Neill first established his reputation, and they are by unanimous
consent the plays by which his name will be remembered through the
years. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding O’Neill, <em>Emperor</em> <em>Jones</em>; <em>The</em>
<em>Straw</em> (157). Published February 1937. <em>WR</em> 27 February 1937. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Published in Vintage
Books, 1972, using plates made from a new typesetting.</p>
<p><em>The Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em> and its predecessor in
the ML, <em>The Emperor Jones; The Straw</em> (157), use the original version
of <em>The Emperor Jones</em>. <em>Nine Plays</em> (G53) and <em>The Plays of Eugene
O’Neill</em> (624) use the revised version. See <em>The Emperor Jones; The
Straw</em> (157) for full information.</p>
<p>The ML paid O’Neill royalties of 5 cents a copy. Shortly before O’Neill
was awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Literature, Cerf asked his
permission to replace the ML volume containing <em>The Emperor Jones</em> and
<em>The Straw</em> with one containing <em>The Emperor Jones</em>, <em>Anna Christie</em>,
and <em>The Hairy Ape</em>. “The substitution of two of your first-line plays
for THE STRAW should mean a tremendous increase in the sale of the
Modern Library volume” (Cerf to O’Neill, 20 October 1936).</p>
<p><em>The Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em> sold 4,051 copies
during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in
the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the same period
O’Neill’s <em>Nine Plays</em> (G53) sold 7,967 copies, placing it solidly in
the first quarter, and <em>The Long Voyage Home</em> (101) sold 2,457 copies.
O’Neill’s sales increased by the early 1950s. <em>The Emperor Jones, Anna
Christie, The Hairy Ape</em> sold 3,708 copies during the twelve-month
period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter
of ML and Giant titles. <em>Nine Plays</em> was in the first quarter with sales
of 5,651 copies.</p>

<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
Three times winner of the Pulitzer award and in 1936 the recipient of
the Nobel Prize for Literature, Eugene O’Neill stands pre-eminent
among the world’s dramatists. The originality, strength and integrity
of his plays have helped bring a new dignity to the American theatre.
What he has done for the theatre of the reader’s imagination is
equally noteworthy, for his dramas have been treasured by an immense
public. The three plays in this volume are representative of the work
done by O’Neill at the crest of his creative powers. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
