<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The world-wide revival of interest in the works of Charles Dickens
makes this completely new edition of his favorite novel an
indispensable addition to the Modern Library series. Its publication,
simultaneous with the appearance of the recently discovered <em>The Life
of Our Lord</em>, will be hailed by Dickens enthusiasts and those
fortunate readers who are in the enviable position of coming upon
<em>David Copperfield</em> for the first time. This edition contains
thirty-nine reproductions from the original illustrations by “Phiz”
and is complete in one volume. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
May 1934. <em>WR</em> 12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971.</p>
<p>Publication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May.
Norris’s <em>The Pit</em> (272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed
until August. Delays in production of <em>The Pit</em> appear to have been
primarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date
of <em>David Copperfield</em> allowed the ML to benefit from anticipated
publicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’s <em>Life of Our
Lord</em>, which was written for his children and published by Simon and
Schuster in May 1934.</p>
<p><em>David Copperfield</em> sold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and
forty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series.
Thackeray’s <em>Vanity Fair</em> (258) outsold <em>David Copperfield</em> at both
periods, but <em>David Copperfield</em> was Dickens’s most popular title in the
ML. <em>The Pickwick Papers</em> (247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the
top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely
made it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> (284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43,
was low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among
the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.</p>

(*Spring 1934*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nMay 1934. *WR* 12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971.\n\nPublication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May.\nNorris’s *The Pit* (272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed\nuntil August. Delays in production of *The Pit* appear to have been\nprimarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date\nof *David Copperfield* allowed the ML to benefit from anticipated\npublicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’s *Life of Our\nLord*, which was written for his children and published by Simon and\nSchuster in May 1934.\n\n*David Copperfield* sold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and\nforty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series.\nThackeray’s *Vanity Fair* (258) outsold *David Copperfield* at both\nperiods, but *David Copperfield* was Dickens’s most popular title in the\nML. *The Pickwick Papers* (247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the\ntop of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely\nmade it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.\n*A Tale of Two Cities* (284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43,\nwas low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among\nthe 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.\n\n#### 269b.
