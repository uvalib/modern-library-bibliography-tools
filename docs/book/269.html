<p><strong>CHARLES DICKENS. DAVID COPPERFIELD. 1934–1971. (ML 110)</strong></p>

(<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in strong bluish green (160) and black on cream paper depicting David Copperfield in top hat background and a coach drawn by four horses in the foreground; borders in strong bluish green, lettering in black. Signed: Newman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The world-wide revival of interest in the works of Charles Dickens makes this completely new edition of his favorite novel an indispensable addition to the Modern Library series. Its publication, simultaneous with the appearance of the recently discovered <em>The Life of Our Lord</em>, will be hailed by Dickens enthusiasts and those fortunate readers who are in the enviable position of coming upon <em>David Copperfield</em> for the first time. This edition contains thirty-nine reproductions from the original illustrations by “Phiz” and is complete in one volume. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1934. <em>WR</em> 12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971.</p>
<p>Publication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May. Norris’s <em>The Pit</em> (272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed until August. Delays in production of <em>The Pit</em> appear to have been primarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date of <em>David Copperfield</em> allowed the ML to benefit from anticipated publicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’s <em>Life of Our Lord</em>, which was written for his children and published by Simon and Schuster in May 1934.</p>
<p><em>David Copperfield</em> sold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and forty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series. Thackeray’s <em>Vanity Fair</em> (258) outsold <em>David Copperfield</em> at both periods, but <em>David Copperfield</em> was Dickens’s most popular title in the ML. <em>The Pickwick Papers</em> (247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely made it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52. <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> (284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43, was low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.</p>

(*Spring 1934*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in strong bluish green (160) and black on cream paper depicting David Copperfield in top hat background and a coach drawn by four horses in the foreground; borders in strong bluish green, lettering in black. Signed: Newman.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The world-wide revival of interest in the works of Charles Dickens makes this completely new edition of his favorite novel an indispensable addition to the Modern Library series. Its publication, simultaneous with the appearance of the recently discovered *The Life of Our Lord*, will be hailed by Dickens enthusiasts and those fortunate readers who are in the enviable position of coming upon *David Copperfield* for the first time. This edition contains thirty-nine reproductions from the original illustrations by “Phiz” and is complete in one volume. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1934. *WR* 12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971.  \n\nPublication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May. Norris’s *The Pit* (272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed until August. Delays in production of *The Pit* appear to have been primarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date of *David Copperfield* allowed the ML to benefit from anticipated publicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’s *Life of Our Lord*, which was written for his children and published by Simon and Schuster in May 1934.  \n\n*David Copperfield* sold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and forty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series. Thackeray’s *Vanity Fair* (258) outsold *David Copperfield* at both periods, but *David Copperfield* was Dickens’s most popular title in the ML. *The Pickwick Papers* (247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely made it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52. *A Tale of Two Cities* (284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43, was low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.  \n\n#### 269b.

Signed: Newman.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The world-wide revival of interest in the works of Charles Dickens makes this completely new edition of his favorite novel an indispensable addition to the Modern Library series. Its publication, simultaneous with the appearance of the recently discovered *The Life of Our Lord*, will be hailed by Dickens enthusiasts and those fortunate readers who are in the enviable position of coming upon *David Copperfield* for the first time. This edition contains thirty-nine reproductions from the original illustrations by “Phiz” and is complete in one volume. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1934. *WR* 12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971.  \n\nPublication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May. Norris’s *The Pit* (272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed until August. Delays in production of *The Pit* appear to have been primarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date of *David Copperfield* allowed the ML to benefit from anticipated publicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’s *Life of Our Lord*, which was written for his children and published by Simon and Schuster in May 1934.  \n\n*David Copperfield* sold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and forty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series. Thackeray’s *Vanity Fair* (258) outsold *David Copperfield* at both periods, but *David Copperfield* was Dickens’s most popular title in the ML. *The Pickwick Papers* (247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely made it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52. *A Tale of Two Cities* (284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43, was low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.  \n\n"
