<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The foremost authorities of the world are in agreement that <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> is one of the great works of fiction in the French language. Such writers as Balzac, Nietzsche, Zola, Dowden, André Gide and Lytton Strachey acclaimed it. <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> finds a distinguished place in the Modern Library series. With <em>The Red and the Black</em> (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of <em>The Works of Stendhal</em>. ML edition (pp. [v]–290; [<em>1</em>]–343) printed from B&amp;L plates. Published January 1937. <em>WR</em> 23 January 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1943.</p>
<p>Arthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to secure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the reprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an introduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured Cerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to Cerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline; <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> went to press without an introduction, and sales were disappointing.</p>
<p>Total printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March 1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold copies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth format, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in the larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information about Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears under “General” in the chapter for 1939.)</p>
<p>Wartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading matter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to drop <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em>, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to other titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in fall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among academics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by George Mayberry in the <em>New Republic</em> (8 November 1943, p. 661):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Open Letter
The Modern Library, Inc.,
New York City.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August 15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for comment.
One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed.
You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness.
May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up remaindered copies at Macy’s.

</blockquote>
<p>Cerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by Mayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,” <em>New Republic</em>, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken?
The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in 1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year, when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for somewhere between four and five years. [<em>This statement was not strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time</em>.]
May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial period in actual sales.
Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s “The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library. Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The Charterhouse of Parma.”
BENNETT A. CERF</p>

<p>Mayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep “such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the Modern Library. —G.M.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation of <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> became a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little magazine <em>Pharos</em> published a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry Levin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the publishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against their country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s masterpiece <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> because they thought they were unable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature as <em>Life with Father</em> and <em>Rebecca</em>” (<em>Pharos</em>, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).</p>
<p>Levin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which consisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”: “. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English, in spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in America, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal has received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).</p>
<p>James T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization of publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in recent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their stock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing? Some Observations on the Future of Books,” <em>New Directions</em> 9, 1946, p. 13).</p>
<p>When Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality” or “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a claim to the intellectual audience by making <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> his first title.</p>
<p>In 1999, fifty-six years after <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> was discontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by Richard Howard. That edition, in paperback, was in print as of 2016.</p>

Signed: Cassens.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> The foremost authorities of the world are in agreement that *The Charterhouse of Parma* is one of the great works of fiction in the French language. Such writers as Balzac, Nietzsche, Zola, Dowden, André Gide and Lytton Strachey acclaimed it. *The Charterhouse of Parma* finds a distinguished place in the Modern Library series. With *The Red and the Black* (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (*Fall 1936*)   \n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni & Liveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of *The Works of Stendhal*. ML edition (pp. [v]–290; [*1*]–343) printed from B&L plates. Published January 1937. *WR* 23 January 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1943.   \n\nArthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to secure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the reprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an introduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured Cerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to Cerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline; *The Charterhouse of Parma* went to press without an introduction, and sales were disappointing.   \n\nTotal printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March 1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold copies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth format, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in the larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information about Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears under “General” in the chapter for 1939.)   \n\nWartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading matter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to drop *The Charterhouse of Parma*, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to other titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in fall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among academics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by George Mayberry in the *New Republic* (8 November 1943, p. 661):   \n\n> An Open Letter \n> The Modern Library, Inc., \n> New York City. \n\n> Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August 15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for comment. \n> One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed. \n> You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness. \n> May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up remaindered copies at Macy’s. \n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">George Mayberry</span>   \n\nCerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by Mayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,” *New Republic*, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):   \n\n> Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken? \n> The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in 1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year, when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for somewhere between four and five years. [*This statement was not strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time*.] \n> May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial period in actual sales. \n> Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s “The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library. Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The Charterhouse of Parma.” \n> BENNETT A. CERF   \n\nMayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:   \n\n> [I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep “such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the Modern Library. —G.M.]   \n\nIntellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation of *The Charterhouse of Parma* became a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little magazine *Pharos* published a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry Levin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the publishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against their country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s masterpiece *The Charterhouse of Parma* because they thought they were unable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature as *Life with Father* and *Rebecca*” (*Pharos*, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).   \n\nLevin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which consisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”: “. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English, in spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in America, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal has received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).   \n\nJames T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization of publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in recent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their stock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing? Some Observations on the Future of Books,” *New Directions* 9, 1946, p. 13).   \n\nWhen Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality” or “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a claim to the intellectual audience by making *The Charterhouse of Parma* his first title.   \n\nIn 1999, fifty-six years after *The Charterhouse of Parma* was discontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by Richard Howard.

Such writers as Balzac, Nietzsche, Zola, Dowden, André Gide and Lytton Strachey acclaimed it. *The Charterhouse of Parma* finds a distinguished place in the Modern Library series. With *The Red and the Black* (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (*Fall 1936*)   \n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni & Liveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of *The Works of Stendhal*.
