<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Instead of beginning his career as a writer of promise, Ernest
Hemingway startled the world, and especially his own generation, with
<em>The Sun Also Rises</em>, his first full-length novel. The disinherited
and disillusioned survivors of the World War discovered in him their
spokesman, a writer free of sentimentality and cant who could summon
forth characters true to their own experience and way of life. <em>The
Sun Also Rises</em> is a chronicle of a lost generation drifting,
frustrated and demoralized, to its doom. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition (pp.
[xi]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930. <em>WR</em>
8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.</p>
<p>The ML paid Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a
copy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as
1927, when he offered a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a
copy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New
York Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was
pleased that <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> was to appear in the series. But he
declined Cerf’s offer of $200 to write an introduction—four times what
F. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML
edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>—explaining that he couldn’t write an
introduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to
write it would be taking $200 out of some critics [<em>sic</em>] pocket—but
beside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to
Cerf, 4 January 1930).</p>
<p>Printings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930),
5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies
(December 1934). <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> was the eighteenth best-selling ML
title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file).
It sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.
It sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML.</p>
<p>Curiously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition of <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>,
despite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and
Unabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being
Jewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he
learned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he
had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the
third paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of
one of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the
richest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter
XVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a
bull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out
badly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a
bull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).</p>
<p>Scribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more
vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three
Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29
October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that <em>The Sun Also
Rises</em> would be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,
Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound
reprint in April 1953 and a $1.45 paperback in August 1957.</p>

(*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Instead of beginning his career as a writer of promise, Ernest\n> Hemingway startled the world, and especially his own generation, with\n> *The Sun Also Rises*, his first full-length novel. The disinherited\n> and disillusioned survivors of the World War discovered in him their\n> spokesman, a writer free of sentimentality and cant who could summon\n> forth characters true to their own experience and way of life. *The\n> Sun Also Rises* is a chronicle of a lost generation drifting,\n> frustrated and demoralized, to its doom. (*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xi\\]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930. *WR*\n8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as\n1927, when he offered a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New\nYork Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was\npleased that *The Sun Also Rises* was to appear in the series. But he\ndeclined Cerf’s offer of $200 to write an introduction—four times what\nF. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*—explaining that he couldn’t write an\nintroduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to\nwrite it would be taking $200 out of some critics \\[*sic*\\] pocket—but\nbeside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to\nCerf, 4 January 1930).\n\nPrintings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930),\n5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies\n(December 1934). *The Sun Also Rises* was the eighteenth best-selling ML\ntitle during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file).\nIt sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.\nIt sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML.\n\nCuriously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition of *The Sun Also Rises*,\ndespite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and\nUnabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being\nJewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he\nlearned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he\nhad felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the\nthird paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of\none of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the\nrichest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter\nXVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out\nbadly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three\nHemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29\nOctober 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *The Sun Also\nRises* would be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nreprint in April 1953 and a $1.45 paperback in August 1957.\n\n#### 190b.
