<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> In his revealing introduction written specially for this edition, W. Somerset Maugham expresses his own preference among all the novels in his long and distinguished career. He says: “I am willing enough to agree with common opinion that <em>Of Human Bondage</em> is my best work. It is the kind of book that an author can only write once. After all, he has only one life. But the book I like best is <em>Cakes and Ale</em>.” The same distinction has been made by countless enthusiastic readers. They consider <em>Of Human Bondage</em> Maugham’s masterpiece. But the novel they take to their hearts for its candor and warmth and humor is <em>Cakes and Ale</em>.
The third Maugham novel in the Modern Library (<em>Of Human Bondage</em>, No. 176, and <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em>, No. 27, are the other two), is introduced into the series with the author’s own version of the controversies and conjectures aroused by this withering but affectionate satire. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
