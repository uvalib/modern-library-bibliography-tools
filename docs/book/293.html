<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> The inclusion of <em>The Complete Works of Horace</em> in the Modern Library series carries forward the policy of issuing the classic writers of antiquity, as well as the best works of their successors, including our own contemporaries, in editions that are notable for their completeness and scholarship. This volume contains all the satires, odes, epodes, epistles, hymns and the essay <em>The Art of Poetry</em>. The translations were chosen for their fidelity and for their retention of the gay and ebullient spirit of Quintus Horatius Flaccus. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published June 1936. <em>WR</em> 27 June 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Kraemer, a professor at New York University, proposed the Horace volume. He asked for an advance of $100 and royalties at the standard sliding scale for trade books of 10 to 15 percent (Kraemer to Cerf, 20 June 1935). Cerf agreed to the advance but indicated that the ML could only pay royalties of 5 percent (Cerf to Kraemer, 25 June 1935). Kraemer accepted these terms. <em>The Complete Works of Horace</em> reprinted 29 pages from <em>Horace and English Verse</em> translated by Alexander Murison, which was copyrighted by Longmans, Green &amp; Co. in the British Empire but not in the United States. Cerf requested permission to use the material, but Longmans, Green wanted a fee of twenty guineas. This was more than Cerf was prepared to pay, so the ML used the material without permission. He told Longmans, Green that the ML would confine distribution to the United States and Canada. Longmans, Green asked its Canadian office to stop imports into Canada. T. F. Pike of the Longmans, Green Toronto office wrote to Hugh Eayrs of the Macmillan Co. of Canada, the ML’s Canadian distributors, so that he could “advise London my duty has been done” (Pike to Eayrs, 30 November 1936). Eayrs passed his letter along to Cerf.</p>
<p><em>The Complete Works of Horace</em> sold 2,730 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 44,171 copies by spring 1958.</p>

For centuries, poets and scholars have made new translations of the poems and prose of Horace.

This volume contains all the satires, odes, epodes, epistles, hymns and the essay *The Art of Poetry*. The translations were chosen for their fidelity and for their retention of the gay and ebullient spirit of Quintus Horatius Flaccus. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published June 1936. *WR* 27 June 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nKraemer, a professor at New York University, proposed the Horace volume. He asked for an advance of \\$100 and royalties at the standard sliding scale for trade books of 10 to 15 percent (Kraemer to Cerf, 20 June 1935). Cerf agreed to the advance but indicated that the ML could only pay royalties of 5 percent (Cerf to Kraemer, 25 June 1935). Kraemer accepted these terms. *The Complete Works of Horace* reprinted 29 pages from *Horace and English Verse* translated by Alexander Murison, which was copyrighted by Longmans, Green & Co. in the British Empire but not in the United States. Cerf requested permission to use the material, but Longmans, Green wanted a fee of twenty guineas. This was more than Cerf was prepared to pay, so the ML used the material without permission. He told Longmans, Green that the ML would confine distribution to the United States and Canada. Longmans, Green asked its Canadian office to stop imports into Canada. T. F. Pike of the Longmans, Green Toronto office wrote to Hugh Eayrs of the Macmillan Co. of Canada, the ML’s Canadian distributors, so that he could “advise London my duty has been done” (Pike to Eayrs, 30 November 1936). Eayrs passed his letter along to Cerf.  \n\n*The Complete Works of Horace* sold 2,730 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 44,171 copies by spring 1958.  \n\n#### 293b.
