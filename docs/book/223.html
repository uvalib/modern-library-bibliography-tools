<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The novel upon which William McFee’s reputation rests most securely is
<em>Casuals of the Sea</em>. When it appeared, twenty years ago, he was
hailed, with Joseph Conrad, as one of the two greatest story-tellers
of the sea. Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a
new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama
of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against
the forces of nature and man’s will. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1916. ML edition
printed from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new
typesetting. Published November 1931. <em>WR</em> 5 December 1931. First
printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in
January 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly
interested in <em>Captain Macedoine’s Daughter</em>, but McFee appears to have
been opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf
invited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s <em>Purple Land</em> (134)
and indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the
possibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26
August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,
<em>Casuals of the Sea</em> and <em>Command</em>, were in the Sun Dial Library, which
the ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday
reprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both
novels, but in the end only <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> was added.</p>
<p>Morley’s introduction to <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> was originally for the
Lambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.</p>
<p>The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10
cents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when
there was a printing of 1,000 copies.</p>
<p><em>Casuals of the Sea</em> sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and
Giant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945.
It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during
the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>When Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition of <em>Command</em> in 1933, Cerf
responded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book,
but [it] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished
somewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de
Graff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In
1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> to
McFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with
McFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to
be applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the
plates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a
copy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).</p>

When it appeared, twenty years ago, he was\n> hailed, with Joseph Conrad, as one of the two greatest story-tellers\n> of the sea. Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a\n> new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama\n> of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against\n> the forces of nature and man’s will. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916. ML edition\nprinted from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new\ntypesetting. Published November 1931. *WR* 5 December 1931. First\nprinting: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.\n\nCerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in\nJanuary 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly\ninterested in *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, but McFee appears to have\nbeen opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf\ninvited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s *Purple Land* (134)\nand indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the\npossibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26\nAugust 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,\n*Casuals of the Sea* and *Command*, were in the Sun Dial Library, which\nthe ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday\nreprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both\nnovels, but in the end only *Casuals of the Sea* was added.\n\nMorley’s introduction to *Casuals of the Sea* was originally for the\nLambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.\n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when\nthere was a printing of 1,000 copies.\n\n*Casuals of the Sea* sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945.\nIt was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during\nthe twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\nWhen Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition of *Command* in 1933, Cerf\nresponded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book,\nbut \\[it\\] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished\nsomewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de\nGraff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In\n1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in *Casuals of the Sea* to\nMcFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with\nMcFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to\nbe applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the\nplates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).\n\n#### 223b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\n\\[torchbearer E3\\] | \\[7-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin single rules\\] CASUALS | OF | THE SEA | BY | WILLIAM M<span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">c</span>FEE | WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY | CHRISTOPHER\nMORLEY | \\[below frame\\] THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xvi \\[xvii–xviii\\], \\[1–2\\] 3–513 \\[514–518\\].\n\\[1–16\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[17\\]<sup>12</sup>\n\nContents as 223a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE\nMODERN LIBRARY, INC.; \\[514–518\\] blank.
