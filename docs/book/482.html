<p>Front flap:<br>
Few areas of world literature are as little known to English-speaking
readers as Spanish fiction. Yet none is more highly regarded by those
who have had the opportunity to explore it. The sixteen stories
selected for this volume by Angel Flores represent some of the best
prose fiction of modern times and include the work of such old masters
as Alarcón and Unamuno as well as the work of younger writers now
living in Spain or in exile. The editors of the Modern Library are
pleased to add this volume to the rich coverage of great literature
now in the series. (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>
