<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Of the seventeen books by which William Faulkner has achieved an international reputation as one of America’s leading novelists, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> are considered most representative. The unsparing chronicler of the South, Faulkner is far more than a regional novelist; he is the observer and the critic of a doomed but tenacious civilization. His imaginary world is all of the South cherishing the relics of a lost age of glory. For <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> William Faulkner contributes a brilliant Appendix which serves as his own last word on this controversial book. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap reset with first sentence revised as follows: <br> Of the twenty books for which William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> are considered by critics and general readers most representative of his work. (<em>Spring 1963</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Sound and the Fury</em> originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1929; <em>As I Lay Dying</em> originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1946. <em>WR</em> 7 December 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by separate ML editions of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1966) and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (1967).</p>
<p>Faulkner’s <em>Sanctuary</em> (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only Faulkner title in the series until the addition of <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a Random House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave Random House publishing rights to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929), <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (1930), <em>Sanctuary</em> (1931), <em>Light in August</em> (1932), and <em>Pylon</em> (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread critical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s subsequent works, including <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (1936), <em>The Unvanquished</em> (1938), <em>The Wild Palms</em> (1939), <em>The Hamlet</em> (1940), and <em>Go Down, Moses</em> (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s novels except <em>Soldier’s Pay</em> (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1926), <em>Mosquitoes</em> (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1927) and <em>Sartoris</em> (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it took ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf and Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML.</p>
<p>Faulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published <em>The Portable Faulkner</em>, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> &amp; <em>As I Lay Dying</em> in a single volume. The two volumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of Faulkner’s stature in the United States.</p>
<p>Evelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been interested in publishing a ML edition of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> or <em>As I Lay Dying</em> in the early 1930s but took <em>Sanctuary</em> instead because plates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles (Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and 1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a second printing than to make plates—and plates were available for <em>Sanctuary</em>.</p>
<p>Linscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (Linscott to Cowley, 31 December 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider <em>As I Lay Dying</em> to be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way below” <em>Light in August</em>. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the two works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>Light in August</em> reprinted separately. He continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I don’t think that’s such a good idea either. [In its list for fall and winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited edition of <em>The Sound and the Fur</em>y with the text in three colors and a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.] But for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix? (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley that the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to write an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945 The Compsons” that Faulkner had written for <em>The Portable Faulkner</em>. Cowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing permission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,” having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel. His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow— either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer, because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or else hijack a copy from some friend.
I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack [<em>sic</em>], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business [see G68]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux, perhaps, now writing in any language. . . .
I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels. I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too, under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an end paper [paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as a frontispiece]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry.
I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book [<em>The Portable Faulkner</em>]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 [i.e., 1946]; underlining in original).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . .
I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back.
Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more likely to want to read the other.
On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott to Cowley, 15 February 1946).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The ML printed his Appendix from <em>The Portable Faulkner</em> with minor revisions, placing it at the beginning of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, referring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by the author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was superseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume (pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four novels (<em>Soldiers’ Pay</em>, <em>Mosquitoes</em>, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>), published in 2006, also prints the appendix “Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (pp. 1127–41).</p>
<p><em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> sold 10,640 copies during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh best-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American writer and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more than 10,000 copies at this period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (1930) 11,563
Aquinas, <em>Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas</em> (1948) 11,129
Aristotle, <em>Introduction to Aristotle</em> (1947) 11,114
Tolstoy, <em>War and Peace</em> (Giant, 1931) 11,111
Dostoyevsky, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (1932) 10,943
Freud, <em>Basic Writings</em> (Giant, 1938) 10,669
Faulkner, <em>Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> (1946) 10,640
Plato, <em>Works of Plato</em> (1930) 10,302</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> was almost the ML’s sixth best-selling title. <em>The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud</em> outsold the Faulkner volume by twenty-nine copies.</p>
<p>Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years after the publication of <em>The Portable Faulkner</em> and the ML edition of <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em>.</p>

The unsparing chronicler of the South, Faulkner is far more than a regional novelist; he is the observer and the critic of a doomed but tenacious civilization. His imaginary world is all of the South cherishing the relics of a lost age of glory. For *The Sound and the Fury* William Faulkner contributes a brilliant Appendix which serves as his own last word on this controversial book. (*Fall 1946*) \n\n> Front flap reset with first sentence revised as follows: <br> Of the twenty books for which William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* are considered by critics and general readers most representative of his work. (*Spring 1963*) \n\n*The Sound and the Fury* originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1929; *As I Lay Dying* originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1946. *WR* 7 December 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by separate ML editions of *The Sound and the Fury* (1966) and *As I Lay Dying* (1967). \n\nFaulkner’s *Sanctuary* (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only Faulkner title in the series until the addition of *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a Random House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave Random House publishing rights to *The Sound and the Fury* (1929), *As I Lay Dying* (1930), *Sanctuary* (1931), *Light in August* (1932), and *Pylon* (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread critical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s subsequent works, including *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936), *The Unvanquished* (1938), *The Wild Palms* (1939), *The Hamlet* (1940), and *Go Down, Moses* (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s novels except *Soldier’s Pay* (Boni & Liveright, 1926), *Mosquitoes* (Boni & Liveright, 1927) and *Sartoris* (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it took ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf and Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML. \n\nFaulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published *The Portable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published *The Sound and the Fury* & *As I Lay Dying* in a single volume. The two volumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of Faulkner’s stature in the United States. \n\nEvelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been interested in publishing a ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay Dying* in the early 1930s but took *Sanctuary* instead because plates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles (Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and 1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a second printing than to make plates—and plates were available for *Sanctuary*. \n\nLinscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint of *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (Linscott to Cowley, 31 December 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider *As I Lay Dying* to be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way below” *Light in August*. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the two works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see *The Sound and the Fury* and *Light in August* reprinted separately. He continued: \n\n> Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I don’t think that’s such a good idea either. [In its list for fall and winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited edition of *The Sound and the Fur*y with the text in three colors and a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.] But for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix? (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946). \n\nCowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley that the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to write an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945 The Compsons” that Faulkner had written for *The Portable Faulkner*. Cowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing permission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on: \n\n> Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,” having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel. His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow— either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer, because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or else hijack a copy from some friend. \n> I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack [*sic*], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business [see G68]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux, perhaps, now writing in any language. . . . \n> I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels. I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too, under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an end paper [paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as a frontispiece]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry. \n> I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book [*The Portable Faulkner*]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 [i.e., 1946]; underlining in original). \n\nLinscott replied: \n\n> I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . . \n> I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back. \n> Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more likely to want to read the other. \n> On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott to Cowley, 15 February 1946). \n\nIn the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The ML printed his Appendix from *The Portable Faulkner* with minor revisions, placing it at the beginning of *The Sound and the Fury*, referring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by the author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was superseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume (pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four novels (*Soldiers’ Pay*, *Mosquitoes*, *Flags in the Dust*, and *The Sound and the Fury*), published in 2006, also prints the appendix “Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of *The Sound and the Fury* (pp. 1127–41). \n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* sold 10,640 copies during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh best-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American writer and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more than 10,000 copies at this period: \n\n> Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930) 11,563 \n> Aquinas, *Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas* (1948) 11,129 \n> Aristotle, *Introduction to Aristotle* (1947) 11,114 \n> Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (Giant, 1931) 11,111 \n> Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 10,943 \n> Freud, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1938) 10,669 \n> Faulkner, *Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (1946) 10,640 \n> Plato, *Works of Plato* (1930) 10,302 \n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was almost the ML’s sixth best-selling title. *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* outsold the Faulkner volume by twenty-nine copies. \n\nFaulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years after the publication of *The Portable Faulkner* and the ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*.

The unsparing chronicler of the South, Faulkner is far more than a regional novelist; he is the observer and the critic of a doomed but tenacious civilization. His imaginary world is all of the South cherishing the relics of a lost age of glory. For *The Sound and the Fury* William Faulkner contributes a brilliant Appendix which serves as his own last word on this controversial book. (*Fall 1946*) \n\n> Front flap reset with first sentence revised as follows: <br> Of the twenty books for which William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* are considered by critics and general readers most representative of his work. (*Spring 1963*) \n\n*The Sound and the Fury* originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1929; *As I Lay Dying* originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1946. *WR* 7 December 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by separate ML editions of *The Sound and the Fury* (1966) and *As I Lay Dying* (1967). \n\nFaulkner’s *Sanctuary* (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only Faulkner title in the series until the addition of *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a Random House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave Random House publishing rights to *The Sound and the Fury* (1929), *As I Lay Dying* (1930), *Sanctuary* (1931), *Light in August* (1932), and *Pylon* (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread critical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s subsequent works, including *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936), *The Unvanquished* (1938), *The Wild Palms* (1939), *The Hamlet* (1940), and *Go Down, Moses* (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s novels except *Soldier’s Pay* (Boni & Liveright, 1926), *Mosquitoes* (Boni & Liveright, 1927) and *Sartoris* (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it took ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf and Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML. \n\nFaulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published *The Portable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published *The Sound and the Fury* & *As I Lay Dying* in a single volume. The two volumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of Faulkner’s stature in the United States. \n\nEvelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been interested in publishing a ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay Dying* in the early 1930s but took *Sanctuary* instead because plates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles (Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and 1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a second printing than to make plates—and plates were available for *Sanctuary*. \n\nLinscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint of *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (Linscott to Cowley, 31 December 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider *As I Lay Dying* to be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way below” *Light in August*. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the two works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see *The Sound and the Fury* and *Light in August* reprinted separately. He continued: \n\n> Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I don’t think that’s such a good idea either. [In its list for fall and winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited edition of *The Sound and the Fur*y with the text in three colors and a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.] But for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix? (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946). \n\nCowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley that the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to write an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945 The Compsons” that Faulkner had written for *The Portable Faulkner*. Cowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing permission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on: \n\n> Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,” having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel. His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow— either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer, because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or else hijack a copy from some friend. \n> I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack [*sic*], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business [see G68]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux, perhaps, now writing in any language. . . . \n> I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to start Faulkner back into general circulation.
