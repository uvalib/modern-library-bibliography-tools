1932.; 1–380 text; [381–385] ML list; [386] blank. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in deep purple (224) and black on gray paper
depicting a barefoot man kneeling by a body of water and drinking;
borders in deep purple, lettering in black. Signed: [Jacob] Burck.
(<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Jonathan Cape &amp; Harrison Smith, 1931. ML edition
(pp. 1–380) printed from Cape &amp; Smith plates. Published March 1932. <em>WR</em>
26 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.
Published in Vintage Books, spring 1967.</p>
<p>Cerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the
ML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your
Modern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to
take with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE
FURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the
time the book was published, in your list [Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,
<em>On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,</em> was published by Cape &amp;
Smith in 1929]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will
be a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us
up.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few
volumes. He requested Joyce’s <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
and any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books
in which a Dostoyefsky [<em>sic</em>] influence was found. I have never read
Dostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf,
15 April 1931).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> or <em>As I Lay
Dying</em>, but Cape &amp; Smith had printed both novels from standing type
which had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s
audience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the
cost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in
production and design at Cape &amp; Smith, Smith &amp; Haas, and Random House
between 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for
books without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was
cheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the
possibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year
or so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be
instructed to melt the type (Harter, <em>The Making of William Faulkner’s
Books, 1929</em>–<em>1939</em>, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult
for reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive
reprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial
publication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from
the original publisher’s plates.</p>
<p>Faulkner’s next book, <em>Sanctuary</em>, had more commercial appeal. It was
the only Faulkner title published by Cape &amp; Smith for which plates were
made. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback.
The American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet
Books—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight
printings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies
(Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on
front cover).</p>
<p>In his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he
initially wrote <em>Sanctuary</em> for money. The introduction begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea,
because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been
writing books for about five years, which got published but not
bought. . . .</p>
<p>Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in
terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of
it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in
Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought
was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could
imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job
working the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between
12 and 4, I wrote <em>As I Lay Dying</em> in six weeks, without changing a
word. I sent it to Smith [his publisher] and wrote him that by it I
would stand or fall.” He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I had forgotten about <em>Sanctuary</em>, just as you might forget
about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.
<em>As I Lay Dying</em> was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of
<em>Sanctuary</em> until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so
terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite
it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy
it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been
already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting
it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame <em>The
Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> too much and I made a fair
job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they
will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than
the rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be
reset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees
Book Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the
introduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like
Burck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when
E. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger
format.</p>
<p>Faulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith &amp;
Haas. <em>Sanctuary</em> remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when
<em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> (394) were published together
in a single volume.</p>
<p><em>Sanctuary</em> sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.
Faulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel
Prize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the
series. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in
terms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952. <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> was the fifth
best-selling title in the regular ML, followed by <em>Light in August</em>
(429), <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (434), and <em>Sanctuary</em> (233), which sold
4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in
the regular ML.</p>

The sinister and depraved figure of Popeye dominates as extraordinary
a novel as our contemporary national literature can boast. <em>Sanctuary</em>
is a story-teller’s <em>tour de force</em>, a tense and impassioned narration
of a horrific aspect of life that only the vigorous and the
healthy–minded can bear without wincing. It is a virile, challenging
novel that cannot be ignored or set aside. <em>Sanctuary</em> arouses the
most extreme enthusiasm or revulsion; it holds spellbound its most
ardent admirers and bitterest foes from first sentence to last. (<em>Fall
1933</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This celebrated book, the sixth of William Faulkner’s novels in order
of publication, first appeared on February 9, 1931, but a draft of the
manuscript had been finished nearly two years earlier. When Mr.
Faulkner saw the galley proofs of that version of <em>Sanctuary</em>, he felt
“that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it.”</p>
<p>He chose the latter course and did a thorough revision of the book,
cutting some sections entirely and adding new ones, rewriting other
sections in whole or in part, and rearranging the order of the
narration. He thus succeeded in making it a book which “would not
shame . . . too much,” as he put it, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As
I Lay Dying</em>, which had been published in the two preceding years.
(<em>Inside of jacket blank; back flap lists Faulkner titles published in
the ML through fall 1964.</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letterpress plate for the 233.1c title page appears to have been
used for 233.1d with the line for Faulkner’s introduction and the rule
at the foot of the page removed and <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/H.webp'>torchbearer H</uvalib-modal-image-button> substituted for

<p>The memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from
<em>Sanctuary</em> and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> was dated 14 November 1962 (Box 538,
ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s <em>Light in August</em>
was also dropped around this time. The earliest printing of <em>Sanctuary</em>
without the introduction was in 1963 or 1964. Introductions appear to
have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in
uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of
the uniform Faulkner jacket was for <em>Light in August</em> in spring 1963. By
1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform
jackets. Four, including <em>Sanctuary</em>, were existing ML titles that were
outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—<em>Selected Short Stories</em>,
<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, <em>A Fable</em>, and <em>Pylon</em>—were new to the series.

Discontinued 1971/72.\nPublished in Vintage Books, spring 1967.\n\nCerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the\nML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your\nModern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to\ntake with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE\nFURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the\ntime the book was published, in your list \\[Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,\n*On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,* was published by Cape &\nSmith in 1929\\]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will\nbe a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us\nup.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few\nvolumes. He requested Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*\nand any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books\nin which a Dostoyefsky \\[*sic*\\] influence was found. I have never read\nDostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf,\n15 April 1931).\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to include *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay\nDying*, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type\nwhich had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s\naudience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the\ncost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in\nproduction and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House\nbetween 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for\nbooks without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was\ncheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the\npossibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year\nor so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be\ninstructed to melt the type (Harter, *The Making of William Faulkner’s\nBooks, 1929*–*1939*, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult\nfor reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive\nreprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial\npublication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from\nthe original publisher’s plates.\n\nFaulkner’s next book, *Sanctuary*, had more commercial appeal. It was\nthe only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were\nmade. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback.\nThe American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet\nBooks—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight\nprintings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies\n(Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on\nfront cover).\n\nIn his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he\ninitially wrote *Sanctuary* for money. The introduction begins:\n\n> This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea,\n> because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been\n> writing books for about five years, which got published but not\n> bought. . . .\n>\n> Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in\n> terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of\n> it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in\n> Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought\n> was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could\n> imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)\n\nAfter sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job\nworking the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between\n12 and 4, I wrote *As I Lay Dying* in six weeks, without changing a\nword. I sent it to Smith \\[his publisher\\] and wrote him that by it I\nwould stand or fall.” He continues:\n\n> I think I had forgotten about *Sanctuary*, just as you might forget\n> about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.\n> *As I Lay Dying* was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of\n> *Sanctuary* until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so\n> terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite\n> it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy\n> it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been\n> already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting\n> it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame *The\n> Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* too much and I made a fair\n> job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they\n> will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)\n\nFaulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than\nthe rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be\nreset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees\nBook Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the\nintroduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like\nBurck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when\nE. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger\nformat.\n\nFaulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith &\nHaas. *Sanctuary* remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published together\nin a single volume.\n\n*Sanctuary* sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nFaulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel\nPrize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the\nseries. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in\nterms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952. *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was the fifth\nbest-selling title in the regular ML, followed by *Light in August*\n(429), *Absalom, Absalom!* (434), and *Sanctuary* (233), which sold\n4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in\nthe regular ML.\n\n#### 233.1b.

When Mr.\n> Faulkner saw the galley proofs of that version of *Sanctuary*, he felt\n> “that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it.”\n>\n> He chose the latter course and did a thorough revision of the book,\n> cutting some sections entirely and adding new ones, rewriting other\n> sections in whole or in part, and rearranging the order of the\n> narration. He thus succeeded in making it a book which “would not\n> shame . . . too much,” as he put it, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As\n> I Lay Dying*, which had been published in the two preceding years.\n> (*Inside of jacket blank; back flap lists Faulkner titles published in\n> the ML through fall 1964.*)\n\nThe letterpress plate for the 233.1c title page appears to have been\nused for 233.1d with the line for Faulkner’s introduction and the rule\nat the foot of the page removed and torchbearer H substituted for\ntorchbearer D3.\n\nThe memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from\n*Sanctuary* and *Absalom, Absalom!* was dated 14 November 1962 (Box 538,\nML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s *Light in August*\nwas also dropped around this time. The earliest printing of *Sanctuary*\nwithout the introduction was in 1963 or 1964. Introductions appear to\nhave been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in\nuniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of\nthe uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By\n1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform\njackets. Four, including *Sanctuary*, were existing ML titles that were\noutfitted in new jackets. Four titles—*Selected Short Stories*,\n*Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and *Pylon*—were new to the series.\n*The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, had previously been\ncombined in a single ML volume.",
