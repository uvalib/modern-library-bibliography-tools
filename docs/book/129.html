<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
THE AUTHOR:</p>
<p>James Joyce is the Irish novelist whose epical satire “ULYSSES” has
been hailed as the greatest product of the realistic movement in
literature.</p>
<p>THE BOOK:</p>
<p>“DUBLINERS” was written in 1905, and the author spent the next seven
years trying o make his publisher live up to a contract to bring out
the book. For the reader who has never sampled Joyce, “DUBLINERS” is
an ideal introduction. (<em>Fall 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “A book of
representative stories by the author of ‘Ulysses,’ hailed as the
greatest product of the realistic movement in literature.” (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> after the
ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s decision, sustained
afterward by the Court of Appeals, lends new importance to the Modern
Library edition of <em>Dubliners</em>. This collection of short stories is
definitely related to Joyce’s later work, in that many of its
characters figure in the epical satire, <em>Ulysses</em>, and the
autobiographical novel, <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
(Modern Library No. 145). By itself, <em>Dubliners</em> is a lasting
contribution to the literature of the short story. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in London by Grant Richards, 1914; published in
U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, using sheets of the first English edition.
First American edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting,
published by Huebsch, April 1917. Huebsch merged with Viking Press in
August 1925. ML edition (129.1, pp. [5]–288) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates. Publication announced for 25 November 1926. <em>WR</em>
1 January 1927. First printing: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Dubliners</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 84th
out of 147 ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in
April 1927 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in July 1928. By April
1950 there had been twenty-eight printings for a total of 60,000 copies
(Slocum and Cahoon, p. 17).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
The collection of fifteen stories under the title of <em>Dubliners</em> was
James Joyce’s first published work in prose. Previously he had issued
a book of verse, <em>Chamber Music</em>. These initial efforts were followed
by <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> (Modern Library No. 145),
the play <em>Exiles</em>, the modern epic <em>Ulysses</em> (Modern Library Giant
G-52) and finally, <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. The tales in <em>Dubliners</em> are
related to Joyce’s later work both in locale and in many of the
characters who have a fuller development in <em>Ulysses</em>. By themselves
these tales, written by Joyce in his early twenties, are a
distinguished contribution to the literature of the short story and
are an augury of the master work which was to follow. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definitive edition of <em>Dubliners</em> is as near as possible to the
version Joyce wanted to see published. The text has been prepared by
Robert Scholes of the University of Iowa, in consultation with Richard
Ellmann, Joyce’s biographer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corrected text originally published by Viking Press, 1967. ML edition
(pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the
Viking edition. Published spring 1969 at $2.45.</p>
<p>The statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text
. . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the
corrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate
dialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition
published by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American
edition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American
printings before 1967—used quotation marks.</p>
<p>Printings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½
inch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in
1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼
inch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the
taller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely
redesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼
inch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch
format. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings.
The ISBN <a href="callto:+1394-6012">394-6012</a>4-6 (without the initial 0) was
added to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets
for previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is
probably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain
endpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were
characteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the
remainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front
endpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as
the 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to
understand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to
the 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger
format.</p>
<p>There appears to have been a gap of several years between the
discontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.</p>

Text on front: “A book of\nrepresentative stories by the author of ‘Ulysses,’ hailed as the\ngreatest product of the realistic movement in literature.” (*Fall 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s *Ulysses* after the\n> ban had been lifted by Judge John M.

This collection of short stories is\n> definitely related to Joyce’s later work, in that many of its\n> characters figure in the epical satire, *Ulysses*, and the\n> autobiographical novel, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*\n> (Modern Library No. 145). By itself, *Dubliners* is a lasting\n> contribution to the literature of the short story. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in London by Grant Richards, 1914; published in\nU.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, using sheets of the first English edition.\nFirst American edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting,\npublished by Huebsch, April 1917.

The tales in *Dubliners* are\n> related to Joyce’s later work both in locale and in many of the\n> characters who have a fuller development in *Ulysses*.

The text has been prepared by\n> Robert Scholes of the University of Iowa, in consultation with Richard\n> Ellmann, Joyce’s biographer.\n\nCorrected text originally published by Viking Press, 1967. ML edition\n(pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking edition. Published spring 1969 at $2.45.\n\nThe statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text\n. . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the\ncorrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate\ndialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition\npublished by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American\nedition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American\nprintings before 1967—used quotation marks.\n\nPrintings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½\ninch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in\n1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼\ninch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the\ntaller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely\nredesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼\ninch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch\nformat. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings.\nThe ISBN [394-6012](callto:+1394-6012)4-6 (without the initial 0) was\nadded to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets\nfor previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is\nprobably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain\nendpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were\ncharacteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the\nremainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front\nendpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as\nthe 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to\nunderstand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to\nthe 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger\nformat.\n\nThere appears to have been a gap of several years between the\ndiscontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.\n\n#### 129.2b.
