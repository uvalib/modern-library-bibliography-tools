      "Written by Dumas when he was twenty-five, CAMILLE remains in its combination of freshness and form and of the feeling of the springtime of life, a singular, an astonishing piece of work. The novel and the play have been blown about the world at a fearful rate, but the story has never lost its happy juvenility, a charm that nothing can vulgarize. It is all champagne and tears – fresh perversity, fresh credulity, fresh passion, fresh pain. We have seen the play both well done and ill done – in strange places, in barbarous tongues. But nothing makes any difference – it carries with it an April air: some tender young man and some coughing young woman have only to speak the lines to give it a great place among the love-stories of the world.

A few days afterThe Philosophy of William Jameswas published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined. The ML publishedSelected Papers of Bertrand Russell(147) in October 1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial work appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926 Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was interested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the project three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which published most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary permissions.

      "‘WUTHERING HEIGHTS’ was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out of homely materials. The statuary found a granite block on a solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least one element of grandeur—power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the giant’s foot.

Cerf, who had just bought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited England in Junebut was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he wrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a short introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s “Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I would therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction within a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than four or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of $50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6 August 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After thanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your own books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an ideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September 1925).",

One result of this is that every available fact about their personalities and lives is now familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired, never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.",

The only difference is that the Travellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the first page of each gathering.

During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably reflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion ofWuthering Heightsas one of the first titles in Modern Library College Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for classroom use.",

      "‘WUTHERING HEIGHTS’ was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out of homely materials. The statuary found a granite block on a solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least one element of grandeur—power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the giant’s foot.

It is a book compact of beauty and loveliness, hate and cruelty and heartrending pathos. (Fall 1933)Note:The misspelling of “villainies” is retained on jacket flaps at least through fall 1952.",

      "POOR WHITE tells the story of the American power that dots a vast valley with cities overnight, and builds a network of industry, making quick men rich and fearful men poor. The hero works for this force although he doesn’t like or understand it. He is a dreamy, rather stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made [sic] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s” love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is fulfilled. (Fall 1925)",

      "Lewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so aggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you, it appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that are absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the privilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being, at least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list, although some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder or The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box 128, L. C. Page & Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm commitment on Liveright’s part to include bothThe Maidens of the RocksandThe Intruderin the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the series he demanded that they pay advances of $240 against royalties of 8 cents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him $480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other the following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10 September 1925).",
      "The Maidens of the Rockssold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the beginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year. Page responded with a pitch forThe Intruder, noting that it was part of the trilogy that includedThe Child of PleasureandThe Flame of Lifeand corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He describedThe Maidens of the Rocksas “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough story, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers of the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind any of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always run neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to the two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He concluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the other three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want children’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page to Cerf, 7 February 1927).",
      "Cerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The Intruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the advance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong feeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library with a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).",

It stands quite alone; it strikes a note no other sea writer has ever struck. It is a work not only unique of its kind, but a great achievement—the expression of an imagination that rises to the highest, and so is amongst the world’s great works of art.” —John Masefield",

      "Of the comparatively few books in the world’s literature about which it is safe to foretell the verdict of posterity,Moby Dickstands in the first rank. Universally recognized as one of the greatest of all tales of the sea, it will live by its own surge and elemental force. This mighty history of the pursuit of the vindictive monster, upon which Herman Melville lavished all the resources of his imagination and Jovian hate, is the symbol and the substance of reckless adventure and indomitable courage. (Spring(1939)",
      "ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published June 1926.WRnot found. First printing: Not ascertained.  Discontinued 1976/77.",
      "Melville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The Library of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s, published in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to nineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank. Emerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf Whittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range PS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of nine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in 1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea romances likeTypeeandOmoo.Moby-Dicksold poorly when it was published in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.",
      "The critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the publication of Raymond Weaver’s biography,Herman Melville: Mariner and Mystic(George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication ofBilly Budd, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver edited the manuscript and published it inBilly Budd and OtherProsePieces(London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years later inShorter Novels of Herman Melville(Horace Liveright, 1928).",
      "Weaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His biography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated with a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published autobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia University’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course in Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this man had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . . and discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and a wonderfully nice man” (Cerf,At Random, pp. 17–18).",
      "Weaver wrote introductions to two editions ofMoby-Dickthat were published as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way. His introduction to the edition published by Albert & Charles Boni in 1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the following year for the ML.",
      "The ML may have tried to position its edition ofMoby-Dickto appeal both to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated the darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from Masefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful romance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic, all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s introduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the malice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of leperous [sic] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).",
      "Sales ofMoby Dickduring the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943 it was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings ofMoby Dickfrom January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand following American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven printings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of 2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling 23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).",
      "Cerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing ofMoby Dickunder the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar “specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton House titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a departure from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality paper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and were sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed 500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department stores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do well with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated that they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one of those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to Cerf, 18 August 1932).",
      "The ML also publishedMoby Dick(G65) in 1944 in the Giants series, using plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.",
      "All ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the spelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead of the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of the work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of America edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions that omit it.",
      "The Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new typesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick, is inconsistent. The title isMoby-Dick or, The Whale, but the biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel asMoby Dick, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated form when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form when referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983), which includesRedburnandWhite-Jacketas well asMoby-Dick, uses the hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages (pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record chapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen, with the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp. 985–991) are MOBY DICK.",

From its incomparably effective opening sentence, “Call me Ishmael,” to its dramatic end when the white whale triumphs and all hands, except Ishmael, perish, Melville makes everyone—the reader most of all—share Captain Ahab’s obsessive belief that he alone can destroy the white, evil leviathan.Moby Dickis more than a tale of the pursuit of a monster; it is an allegory of relentless hatred and evil redeemed by man’s indomitable courage.

Because of its unconventional complexity, it is a disturbing book. . . . Like all great books,Moby Dickhas the potentiality of enriching itself with the substance of each new reader’s emotions and ideas, and it has grown greater in its implications with the passage of time.”  —from the Introduction by Leon Howard",

On p. 146, line 5, “lost their charm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm” in 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good morning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after “good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well.

Wise replied that he had not likedUp Streambut would be willing to write an introduction to a ML edition of Lewisohn’sIsrael(Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925). In the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.",
      "Lewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He informed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral and literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not too extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book in such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to Klopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his marriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He removed a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote others. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his fourth story toUncle Remus’s Magazinefor $125, Lewisohn wrote:",
      "My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur. My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML texts).",
      "Lewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:",
      "My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur. Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions within me. . . .",
      "We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . . Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)",

She specifically objected to the passage: “Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked Lewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for including the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful nuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will all have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very earliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).",

      "Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings.Up Streamis at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage, outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion. In the literature of America’s coming of age,Up Streamoccupies a unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final declaration of creative independence. (Spring 1935)",
      "The fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the ML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation. Lewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revisedUp Streamfor the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after those that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to Ludwig Lewisohn in 1936 thatUp Streamcontinued to sell at the rate of 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time that the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying record” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).",
      "Three other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML.A Modern Book of Criticism(75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published in spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936.The Story of American Literature(G43), originally published asExpression in America, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to lobby for the inclusion of his novelThe Island Withinshortly after the Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the series were “more than enough” but suggested thatUp Streammight be dropped andThe Island Withinpublished in its place. Lewisohn approved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass Canfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939).The Island Within(329) sold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.",

      "Printings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½ inch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in 1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼ inch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the taller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely redesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼ inch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch format. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings. The ISBN 394-60124-6 (without the initial 0) was added to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets for previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is probably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain endpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were characteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the remainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front endpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as the 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to understand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to the 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger format.",

Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A thing obviously writtencon amorejoyously without regard to markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —H.L. Mencken. (Spring 1927)",

      "Mr. Ratner remarks that “after having been one of the liberating thinkers of mankind who was read but not honored, Spinoza is fast becoming one of the canonized of mankind who are honored but not read.” This volume with its Life, Introduction, and Selections will immensely assist to get Spinoza read and understood as well as honored. If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities; and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the extracts from Spinoza’sEthicsbetween selections from his more popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech, etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” —John Dewey.

      "Professor Ratner’s masterly arrangement of Spinoza’s philosophy has become the standard text in leading universities throughout the country. John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” (Spring 1935)",

      "Ratner was born in 1901 and received his M.A. from Columbia University in 1923. He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy department at Columbia when he compiledThe Philosophy of Spinoza. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.",
      "Cerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6 October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7 June 1927).",
      "In April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York, Ratner sold his rights toThe Philosophy of Spinozaand John Dewey’sIntelligence in the Modern World(G41) for $500. He also retained the unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700. The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner received no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the contracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus royalties accrued from 1 January 1940.",

      "The vigor and diversity of contemporary American poetry is made strikingly manifest in this anthology. The selections by Conrad Aiken are distinguished for their good taste and the wide range of poetic gifts they reveal. Each of the poets in this volume is generously represented by from a few to a dozen or more poems, an unusual feature in an anthology and one which does greater justice to the whole range of the poet’s work than would the selection of the familiar, isolated poem. (Spring 1935)",
      "Originally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged chronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by Aiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in Aiken’s preface. Published February 1927.WR12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.",
      "Cerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy forModern American Poetsand indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to $700 for permissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He urged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the Secker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos Williams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March 1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single poem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of Williams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,” bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S. Eliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six.",
      "Aiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that permissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the preface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have been unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr Ezra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously belong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence of Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to the ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of Mr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of these three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2) published in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by Sandburg but none by Masters.",
      "Later in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s poems in the ML Giant,An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry(G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging of Aiken’sComprehensive Anthology of American Poetry(169.2).",

      "Aiken suggested revising and modernizingModern American Poetsin 1932 (Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until fall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that Aiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound, Archibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated that he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S. Eliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate Maxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also expressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems. However, whenTwentieth-Century American Poetrywas in galley proofs Linscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except Eliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken eliminated all but two of his own poems.",
      "Wartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles in print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML authors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote that fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod Lib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed serious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our lifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib doesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir? Will we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this year, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow” (Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of his ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be printed when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944).",
      "The revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared early in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional printings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year, but Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the possibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the year, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your anthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count too heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many demands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary paper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945).",
      "Twentieth-Century American Poetrywas out of stock for about six months in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken $500 against 1947 royalties to help him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken, 6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in stock for the first time since the war” (PW, 18 September 1948, p. 1095).",

Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960. Epstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at least $4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised anthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a third. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new collection, and it would require new permissions fees forallthe poems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from the 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material (Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962).",

The terrible conclusion gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of the dawn!”",

      "It is not known why Cerf and Klopfer publishedThe House with the Green Shuttersunder the author’s full name rather than his better-known pseudonym George Douglas.",
      "Seltzer describedThe House with the Green Shuttersas follows: “. . . this famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern fiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young Scotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first book that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and moods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were equally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).",
      "Broun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926) but failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in its place was originally written as an article for the British periodicalJohnO’London’sWeekly(8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never copyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at the last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the ML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the introduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its use. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter of protest toSaturday Review of Literature(“A Writer’s Grievance,”SRL, 10 September 1927, p. 110).",
      "Cerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularizeThe House with the Green Shutters, including distributing a portion of the first printing at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it failed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of 8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second printing of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it might catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the end of the year."

The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear  the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective.

To lash the age, to ridicule vain pretension, to expose hypocrisy, to deride humbug in education, politics, and religion, are tasks beyond most men’s powers; but occasionally, very occasionally, a bit of genuine satire secures for itself more than a passing nod of recognition. ‘Erewhon,’ I think, is such a satire.” (Fall 1927)",

Underneath his irrepressible, malicious laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and stupidity. (Spring 1936)",

These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened philosophy.

The whole sceme [sic] was my idea in the first place and it would have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything could be made on it the money should go to the author.

The storm that broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends.

      "Two other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s.The Life of Jesuswas originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton, 1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation by the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd French edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations, was published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little, Brown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on economic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have required royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public domain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson translation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying royalties and the cost of resetting the text.",

      "In all these portraits there is that same sincere attempt to present the men as they are—the modern Heliogabalus, and the modern ascetic, the section boss, and the village patriarch. Here is wondrous, inscrutable, fascinating life as revealed in the diversity of twelve marionettes of the Great Impressario [sic]. It is one of the most unusual books in our literature, and certainly one of the best books that Dreiser has given us.BurtonRascoe(Spring 1928)",

      "Cerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the rights toTwelve Men. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of $1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October 1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for royalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&L for the use of their plates. B&L received $200 for approving the ML reprint; this appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was deducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received $1,000 when the contract was signed.",
      "Dreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in theNew York Sun(13 April 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken $50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but Mencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis to write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he likedTwelve Menvery much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf to Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928). Charles Merz of theNew York Worldalso declined (Merz to Cerf, 9 February 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou of theChicago Daily News, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought to be doing this himself” (p. v).",
      "Sales of the ML edition were disappointing.Twelve Menranked 34th among the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of 1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales fell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser file) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies (1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421 copies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).",
      "Several years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote thatTwelve Menwas no longer available in any edition. “My publishers, Simon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability to furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep my works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me without a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at least, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf explained whyTwelve Menhad been discontinued and added, “I believe that one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained popular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles each year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit, thereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their keeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to Dreiser, 10 April 1939).",

When, in 1912, Gerhart Hauptmann, then fifty years of age, was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, it was “principally for his rich, versatile and prominent activity in the realm of the drama.” To a world which knows Hauptmann by his “The Sunken Bell,” there is no more convenient way of introducing a work of his which yet is not so widely known as by saying that “The Heretic of Soana” is to Gerhart Hauptmann’s prose fiction what “The Sunken Bell” is to his poetical dramas.

      "Klopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the manuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss to determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the author. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her home in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his mid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer struggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs. Pennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the manuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November 1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).",

In contrast, Suetonius’sLives of the Twelve Caesars(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no illustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.",

When he finally submitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever did in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).",
      "Douglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse Rabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells would say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the immense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth or turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of stones.

      "The Dodd, Mead trade edition ofThe Revolt of the Angelswas an attractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page (text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins. The Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid typesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a type page that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard trim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem.  [scan of Dodd, Mead ed. w ML Jacket Scans file]",
      "In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by photographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the type page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The quality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were higher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an option in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were developed in the early part of the century, but it was not until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book printing industry. The method would have had more use in its early days had it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not well enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked lithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee,Bookmaking, 2nd ed., p. 136).",
      "The Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals were part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page numerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the first line of text, and they were set in a different font that was smaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals. Margins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was ⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted to the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The result was the one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced.",
      "The Revolt of the Angelssold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter. The ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of 17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings of 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly before the final printing. Subsequent sales were as follows: 366 copies (July–December 1936); 344 copies (1937); 319 copies (1938); and 256 copies (January–June 1939, after the ML edition was officially discontinued). The figures for July 1936–June 1939 include the resale of copies returned by booksellers; sales subject to royalty payments during this period totaled 753 copies.",

      "Even more than a study of one of the most heroic personalities of history, John Addington Symond’s [sic] biography of Michelangelo becomes an evaluation of the Renaissance and its most titanic symbol. Of the ninety years of Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a century was consecrated to his great works of art. The unexcelled sculptured figures and the impassioned sonnets suggest two facets of his complex creative personality. The painter of the Sistine Chapel, the sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and the writer indicate the versatility of his gifts and the richness of the heritage he has bestowed upon mankind.

      "Swann’s Way, the first volume of Proust’s great seven-volume masterpieceRemembrance of Things Past, was first published in France in 1913, at Proust’s own expense. The most popular of his books, it stands alone as a unique recreation of what was actually Proust’s own childhood. Swann, the focal character, is the son of a stockbroker and has entered into an “unfortunate” marriage. Marcel, the narrator, remembers that his family’s guests during the early period of his life were practically limited to Swann, who, like the other people in Marcel’s early memories, seemed to him to be “abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree.”",

      "A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetryalso comprised the American portion of the ML Giant,An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry(G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s insistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra Pound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was later returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf ignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve omitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been “overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include a single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was focused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any suggestion of purging Pound fromA Comprehensive Anthology of American PoetryorTwentieth-Century American Poetry(137.2), both of which were published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s poems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the 1947 printing (see G68).",
      "Since the regular ML edition ofA Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry(169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from different type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two formats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of the two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of the Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books are printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point size. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the headline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type pages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the Giant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page, but there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the regular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries, indexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular edition and 420 pages in the Giant.",

The revised edition ofAn Anthology of American Negro Literature(372), edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and 1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies” edited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice M.

Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to me much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much too much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo. And what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story” (Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to Durant, 10 September 1928).

      "Abnormality, as Hippocrates suggested centuries ago, is essentially a matter of defect or of exaggeration, and so the line between what is normal behavior and what is abnormal behavior is a thin, shifting one. In the study of the range of human variability lies a key to sympathetic understanding of those who suffer the tragedy of a sick, disturbed mind. In such study, too, lies a key to a greater capacity to understand one’s own emotional and social growth and thus to cope more skillfully with the endless problems, crises, and frustrations of everyday living. In this book, eminent authorities, using non-technical language, introduce the layman to the scope and the new horizons of abnormal psychology. (Fall 1954)",

      "Murphy wrote Cerf in 1953 that a revision ofAn Outline of Abnormal Psychologywas badly needed. He indicated that he had recently reviewed the selections in the 1929 edition and that in almost every instance it would be possible to select a superior example to represent current research and practice. He noted that he would need a collaborator who was familiar with fields in which he was not up-to-date (Murphy to Cerf, 14 January 1953).",
      "Stein replied four months later that the ML was planning revisions of several titles, includingAn Outline of Abnormal Psychology. He suggested that Murphy engage a collaborator for a flat fee of $300, which would be paid as an advance against Murphy’s royalties, and indicated that the ML would pay up to $300 for permissions. The royalty rate was to remain at 5 cents a copy (Stein to Murphy, 15 May 1953). Murphy thought that $500 should be the minimum fee for a collaborator but believed that permissions would be less than $300. Stein agreed to the $500 collaborator’s fee and reduced the permissions budget to $200 (Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953; Stein to Murphy, 29 May 1953). Murphy selected Bachrach as his collaborator. Bachrach made the preliminary selection of contents, and Murphy wrote a new introduction. The revised edition contained completely new material.",

Klopfer expressed concern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but he acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely putting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your mind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at high schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have proposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on your own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18 June 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).",

He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is superb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though a perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was inherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider changing the translation, which had “established itself as standard for many college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953; Commins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton University Library). Le Clercq’s translation ofCyrano de Bergeracdoes not appear to have been published.",
      "By 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML edition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keepCyranoin the series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt accept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new plates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time Holt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C. Edwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May 1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the mid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy."

      "The sensational success ofThe Bridge of San Luis Reyobscured for a time the fine lustre of Thornton Wilder’s earlier work,The Cabala. But critics and an enthusiastic minority of readers clung to their preference for the calm and suave classicism of the Italian tale in the Henry James tradition. The restraint and the mystical implications ofThe Cabala, the imaginative subtlety with which it is endowed, the firmness of its characterizations, its wit and irony, give it a place of eminence among contemporary novels.

      "Cerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know that you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote, “particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an introduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to send it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is going to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford to buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be made up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words stating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in this edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double the ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the last moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an introduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March 1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the end of March.",

      "“True passion,” Stendhal wrote, “never thinks of anything but itself.” Based on an actual incident that Stendhal read about in theGazette desTribunauxin 1827,The Red and the Blackis a brilliant psychological portrait of passion, opportunism and political intrigue set in 19th-century Restoration France. It is the story of Julien Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois mores and French society,The Red and the Blackestablished Stendhal as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.",

      "The glory that was Greece is nowhere so luminously reflected as in the mirror of her drama. Through the masks of tragedy and comedy, nobility and villainy, and all the duality of the human spirit, the life of man glows to passion and grows dim. Pity and terror in Æschylus, serene detachment in Sophocles, burning fervor for justice in Euripides and the robust intellectual comedy of Aristophanes—these qualities remain the message and the meaning of Greek drama. It is a heritage from antiquity that the modern spirit needs. (Fall 1933)",

Knopf, his American publisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached Knopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He told Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an introduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s usual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf to Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated thatHumphry Clinker, “the work of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he thought thatRoderick Randomwas “more characteristically Smollett: rough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin with. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with his order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April 1927).

      "The rogues’ gallery of ruffians and lusty wenches that gave so much color toRoderick RandomandPeregrine Pickleis matched by an array of cantankerous characters inHumphry Clinker. Here, in the last of his novels as in the others, are the wit and wisdom, the acute powers of observation, and the sharp turn of phrase that characterize all of Tobias Smollett’s work. Here is Smollett, grown tolerant of human frailty after having screamed against it inRoderick Random, now writing in the mellow, satiric vein of amiable elderly people in whom there is a hard core of eccentricity.Humphry Clinker, now almost two hundred years old, still retains the freshness and the vigor of the best of the eighteenth-century novels.

Calverton acknowledged Handy generously in the preface but neglected to include the individual copyright notices. Handy or his representative contacted the ML shortly after publication, insisting that the agreement be honored. Klopfer contacted the ML’s legal counsel about the matter (Klopfer to Edwin A. Falk, 27 November 1929). He subsequently wrote to H. Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders, informing them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected sheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s truckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s stock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,” he stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly printed” (Klopfer to Miss J. A.

      "James Crowder, the ML’s midwestern sales representative, suggested the inclusion ofPeter Whiffle(Crowder to Cerf, 21 December 1928). At this time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering resentment over the ML edition ofGreen Mansions(90). However, Cerf had become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying to put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928). Relations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929 luncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy forPeter Whiffle. He also offered to pay Van Vechten $100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an introduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated that he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van Vechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf turned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929).Peter Whifflewas the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the ML.",

      "Instead of beginning his career as a writer of promise, Ernest Hemingway startled the world, and especially his own generation, withThe Sun Also Rises, his first full-length novel. The disinherited and disillusioned survivors of the World War discovered in him their spokesman, a writer free of sentimentality and cant who could summon forth characters true to their own experience and way of life.The Sun Also Risesis a chronicle of a lost generation drifting, frustrated and demoralized, to its doom. (Spring 1939)",
      "Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition(pp. [xi]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930.WR8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.",
      "The ML paid Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as 1927, when he offered a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New York Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was pleased thatThe Sun Also Riseswas to appear in the series. But he declined Cerf’s offer of $200 to write an introduction—four times what F. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML edition ofThe Great Gatsby—explaining that he couldn’t write an introduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to write it would be taking $200 out of some critics [sic] pocket—but beside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to Cerf, 4 January 1930).",
      "Printings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930), 5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies (December 1934).The Sun Also Riseswas the eighteenth best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales. It sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.",
      "Curiously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition ofThe Sun Also Rises, despite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and Unabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being Jewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he learned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the third paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the richest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter XVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).",
      "Scribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported thatThe Sun Also Riseswould be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr., Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound reprint in April 1953 and a $1.45 paperback in August 1957.",

      "Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Several authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat accepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale University. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed, “Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of Anna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs. Karenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28 January 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that were corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to extend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek was willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance against a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart for his introduction to Gogol’sDead Souls. Stein indicated that $200 was all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to Stein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon College and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell University, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an introduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in any case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March 1950).",

Cerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you really think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no question that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to Smith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles Scribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker titles it published, such asEssays, selected and introduced by H. L. Mencken (1929) orSteeplejack. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s glory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern Library (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936).

      "Cerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an advance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot Holt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a college text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E. Holt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when Herschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a reorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince the new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John Dewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a copy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first payment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that over for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13 February 1928).",
      "By 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told Cerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an introduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and suggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction toThe Dance of Life(1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to write the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey to Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to the ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense. Dewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library Edition” sinceHuman Nature and Conductalready included a preface and an introduction by Dewey.",
      "Someone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his introduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was paginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part of the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the mistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the last page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on its verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing. In its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8 leaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all remaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first printing. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of the contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and the first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of the second state of the first printing (195.1a2) uncorrected copies became the first state of the first printing.",

      "The history of W. Somerset Maugham’s masterpiece is a significant commentary on the changing and maturing taste in fiction. When it appeared in 1915, a few discerning critics hailed it as one of the first important novels of the twentieth century. For several years the public remained apathetic and the book almost suffered the fate of the casual novel. But its loyal champions fought to save it from oblivion. Today, no more popular novel exists in the English language. It has been one of the two best sellers in the entire Modern Library series for the last three years. (Fall 1933)",

      "Cerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four long-sought Doubleday titles—Of Human Bondage, Walpole’sFortitude(201), Huxley’sPoint Counter Point(203), and Bennett’sOld Wives’ Tale(207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a $6,000 advance forOf Human Bondageand agreed to pay royalties of 12 cents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was then paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’sTwelve Men(159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January 1931. Doubleday’s new platesOf Human Bondagewere originally intended for the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden City Publishing Co. around 1933.",
      "In April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent of the list price, which was then $2.45. Royalties on the Vintage paperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a $30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the total was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of $10,000 due on1 January 1969 and 1 January 1970.",
      "In 1968 the ML considered transferringOf Human Bondageto the Giants series, which would have involved photographing the book and making new plates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.",
      "Of Human Bondagewas one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It ranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication date, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in 1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as follows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and 11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not calendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been sold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943Of Human Bondagesold 18,505 copies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the fourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more copies than Dostoyevsky’sCrime and Punishment(228), then the second best-selling title in the regular series. By the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s best-selling title with sales of 11,563 copies.",

Freiman contacted Doubleday, Doran to determine whether it was willing to supply new plates or at least pay part of the cost (Freiman memo to Haas, 13 November 1944). Doubleday, Doran agreed to reset and make new plates for both titles at its own expense as long as the ML agreed to keep them in print and promote them aggressively for at least ten years (Cedric R. Crowell, Doubleday, Doran, to Commins, 2 January 1945). The new plates were delivered to the ML’s printers in December 1945. The ML instructed Parkway Printing Co. to dispose of the old plates and use the new ones for all future printings (Regina Spirito to Bill Simon, Parkway Printing, 13 December 1945).",

      "Of Human Bondagehas remained one of the most popular novels in the English language since its original publication in 1915. Its description of the impact of the British public school system on the growth of an individual is still a definitive one. The torment of a young man involved in an obsessive and destructive love is delineated with compassion and insight, making this one of the most intelligent and important statements on the process of self-discovery. Maugham’s gift as a storyteller has never been more clearly demonstrated.",

Unless the income was substantial, Hoyns indicated, the ML editions “might turn out to be a very unprofitable arrangement from our point of view” (Hoyns to Klopfer, 17 March 1939).",
      "Klopfer and Hoyns met over lunch to discuss the matter. Shortly before the meeting Klopfer wrote directly to Huxley, who was a personal friend: “Help, help, Harper’s are threatening to take POINT COUNTER POINT and ANTIC HAY away from us. These two books belong in the Modern Library and it would be a crime not to have them available in a cheaper edition. . . . Could you influence the Harper office in any way in our favor? I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can make a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a strong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive reprint, rather than just in the $2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to Huxley, 20 March 1939).",
      "Klopfer’s appeal appears to have been successful. Following the lunch Klopfer sent Hoyns new five-year contracts for the books. ThePoint Counter Pointcontract called for the ML to pay a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least 5,000 copies after three years.",
      "In 1965 Harper & Row gave six months’ notice that the ML contract was being terminated so thatPoint Counter Pointcould be included in its own hardbound series, Perennial Classics (Virginia Olson, Harper & Row, to Epstein, 23 July 1965). The ML was allowed to sell out its stock on hand, which consisted of 4,400 copies (Epstein to Olson, 9 August 1965). The ML edition was out of stock by summer 1967.",

      "“. . . in these writings, unique at once in the history of literature and the history of philosophy, [the reader] meets thought whose medium is not dogma but drama, drama among whose chief excitements are the subtle suspenses of thought. . . . The ‘philosophy’ of Plato is clearly not a philosophy of the schools; his drama is profounder in theme and more comprehensive in range than the constricted little toys of the stage. For those who have not learned with Plato that philosophy is the love of wisdom rather than the pronouncement of truth, there is considerable mystification in a thinker whose thoughts are all suggestions, whose suggestions are often playful, and who will not, despite the attempt of more than one serious critic, be crammed into a neat and lifeless system. The reader is haunted, too, by the perturbed sense that, though these dialogues are full of endless charm as poetic and ironic drama, they are clearly more than the by-play of a gifted writer. The further one reads the more deeply does one come into the presence of the profoundest and most serious issues of human existence. What on its winning surface is the spirited conversation between Socrates and a group of attractive young Athenian aristocrats, closely read, stirs one profoundly to a consideration of the nature of good and evil, of reality, of the paramount mystery of the human soul.”\t—from the Introduction by Irwin Edman",

      "Henry Fielding’s story of a foundling is now more than two hundred years old, but still it has the vitality and appeal it had for its readers in the middle of the eighteenth century. Then, with few predecessors, Fielding created his own form and brought forth a pioneer work of English fiction. Now, with countless imitators, his book is read with the kind of appreciation one reserves for a novel that understands the ageless frailties of mankind and forgives them. A book that makes pretensions ridiculous and shows tolerance for weakness is ageless.Tom Jonesis remembered with affection by readers of every variety for its complete naturalness and for its vivid characters. After two centuries the permanence of Henry Fielding’s novel is assured. (Fall 1956)",

      "An enormous, exuberant novel of appetite—for food, drink, women, experience—Tom Jonesis, according to Samuel Coleridge, one of the most nearly perfect plots in the world. A foundling, Tom, is discovered one morning by Squire Allworthy and his squarish sister Bridget and brought up as a son in their household until it is time for him to leave and seek not only his fortune but his real identity. Athletic, charismatic, generous, filled with what Fielding called “the glorious lust of doing good” but with a tendency toward dissolution, Tom Jones is one of the first characters in fiction ever to display legitimate sides of good and evil.Tom Jones, the novel is one of the first examples of the “novel of incident,” one which develops character along with plot, and a crucial influence upon the development of modern fiction.",

      "For more than five centuries Giovanni Boccaccio’sThe Decameronhas stood virtually unchallenged in its supremacy as the world’s greatest collection of tales. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Keats and many other literary immortals found in these Florentine stories a never-failing inspiration and a veritable source book for plot material. To the modern reader,The Decameronaffords undiminished stimulation and pleasure, despite the strictures and the vain attempts at suppression by hysterical censors. Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (Fall 1939)",
      "Payne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1931.WR21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).",
      "Cerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure thatThe Decameronwould not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of occasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury Department did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its importation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A. Falk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who indicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include shocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).",
      "The ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to John S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance ofThe Decameron, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American universities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He stated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p. xxii).",
      "Cerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously, but Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed foreword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our friend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I rather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors, might shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the title page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees. Cerf assured booksellers in an article inPWthat the Payne translation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying the sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of public morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,”PW119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).",
      "Sumner did not challenge the ML edition, butThe Decameronremained a controversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who specialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML jacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any title at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the DROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales representative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of titles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked Lewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised: “Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern maidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a stink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).",
      "The Decameronwas the best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower than in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.",

      "Lord Jimis by all odds the most popular novel by Joseph Conrad, as well as one of the most exciting adventure stories ever written.

      "The Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included Canadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights when they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers when they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the Macmillan Co. of Canada, soldLord Jimfor five months before Blackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the transgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped sellingLord Jimin Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian sales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards” (Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to Longwell, 4 September 1931).",
      "Lord Jimsold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant titles.

      "Perhaps the most popular of all his novels,Lord Jimis undoubtedly Joseph Conrad’s most exciting adventure story. Its theme of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity and destroyed by his sense of lost honor is one of the most appealing in the literature of idealism. All the powers of a great descriptive artist and a thinker concerned with courage and devotion and the crises of conscience are lavished upon this tale of a man who stakes his life on a high principle and loses. “I will have no favorites,” Conrad wrote to an admirer, “but I do not feel grieved that you preferLord Jimto all my other books.” (Spring 1955)",

      "Concededly the most important autobiography that has yet been written in America,The Education of Henry Adamshas exercised an enormous influence upon a generation now coming into its full maturity. An edition of one hundred copies, printed privately in 1907, had aroused profound admiration among scholars. When it was published in 1918, it immediately won and has since held an assured place among the significant works in American literature. This chronicle of a brilliant career and a constant spiritual quest is one of our great national literary treasures. (Spring 1936)",

      "Privately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade edition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s death.

ML edition (pp. [v]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates. Published March 1931.WR28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1978/79.",
      "The Education of Henry Adamswas one of the first titles Cerf tried to get after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original edition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a reprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August 1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint. Cerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of the original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told Houghton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be taken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin had reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It will be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very proud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).",
      "He offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two cents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for nonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930; Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf did not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the one-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin reduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s to 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for writing the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).",
      "Scaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library edition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the plates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April 1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid 1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.",
      "Later in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing ofThe Education of Henry Adamsin the format of the new ML Giants series. Around the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special printing of Young’sThe Mediciin the same format that had been made for Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of the first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the publisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”",
      "The Education of Henry Adamswas the thirteenth best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed into the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782 copies.",

      "“Few books have had so unexpected success asThe Education of Henry Adams. Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first published edition appeared. AlthoughThe Educationhad aroused a deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant works in American literature but among those which command a wide and steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation, the influence of the book is markedly increasing.”  — from the Introduction"

      "Katherine Mansfield’s sharp perceptions of significant detail, her vivid strokes of characterization and her ability so sensitively to merge reality with unreality give to her short stories the qualities of a remembered experience rather than those of a tale merely well told. In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for truth so evident in her life and work. (Spring 1934)",

      "Cerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint contract with Knopf in October 1929 forThe Dove’s Nest, paying a $500 advance.The Garden Partywas not considered because an inexpensive reprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML bought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to cancel the contract forThe Dove’s Nestso that the ML could include the more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947).",
      "The Garden Partyhad a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There were printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an additional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies during the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June 1938).The Garden Partysold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern Library during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

The unspeakable has no existence for him; his service to his own truth is constant and uncompromising. Of the thirty distinguished volumes he has published, many of them rare and unobtainable because of their revelations,The Counterfeitersis his only novel, and he has avowed in his Journal: “Without reserve, I want to pour into it everything.” The translation is complete and unexpurgated.

The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was intended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf, 18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.",
      "Knopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication date was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the following year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’sLafcadio’s Adventures, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in spring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait forThe Counterfeiters(Knopf to Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the final reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably similar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for renewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keepThe Counterfeitersin the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any spectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to Knopf, 24 October 1939).",

The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had castSanineirretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf suggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates (Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates, and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).",

      "Of all the distinguished novels written by Willa Cather, none has brought her greater prestige or a wider circle of readers thanDeath Comes for the Archbishop. This historical chronicle of the apostolic mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity. Its rich humanity and its stirring account of the tenacity of a race giving way to the inevitable make it a memorable book to readers of every shade of religious conviction and literary taste.

      "Willa Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to include in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright. Cerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’sMy ÁntoniaorThe Song of the Lark, offering royalties of eight cents a copy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who was then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they approached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint ofDeath Comes for the Archbishop, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.",
      "The ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML printings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies (December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934), 5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the ML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows: 14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).",
      "After the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want any of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked Knopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of the contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock after the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf, indicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September 25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:",
      "In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather, and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the contract?",
      ". . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).",
      "Knopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from her point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June 1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936.DeathComesfortheArchbishopwas listed in the ML’s spring 1937 catalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to Eayrs, 28 May 1937).",

      "Widely regarded as Willa Cather’s masterpiece,Death Comes For The Archbishopis set in the mid-19th century. Two French missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese, knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe, using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the New Mexican way of life.",

      "The novel upon which William McFee’s reputation rests most securely isCasuals of the Sea. When it appeared, twenty years ago, he was hailed, with Joseph Conrad, as one of the two greatest story-tellers of the sea. Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against the forces of nature and man’s will. (Spring 1936)",
      "Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916. ML edition printed from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new typesetting. Published November 1931.WR5 December 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.",
      "Cerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in January 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly interested inCaptain Macedoine’s Daughter, but McFee appears to have been opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf invited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’sPurple Land(134) and indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the possibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,Casuals of the SeaandCommand, were in the Sun Dial Library, which the ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both novels, but in the end onlyCasuals of the Seawas added.",
      "Morley’s introduction toCasuals of the Seawas originally for the Lambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.",
      "The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when there was a printing of 1,000 copies.",
      "Casuals of the Seasold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.",
      "When Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition ofCommandin 1933, Cerf responded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book, but [it] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished somewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de Graff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In 1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights inCasuals of the Seato McFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with McFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to be applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the plates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a copy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).",

      "The modern point of view, contemptuous of all the old canons of Victorian morality, beauty and love, is nowhere more brilliantly championed than in the novels of Aldous Huxley. Full of shrewd commentaries and stinging humor, his books are extravaganzas that satirize the world of today. The two novels by which he is best known,Point Counter Point(No. 180) andAntic Hay, are in the same temper. Both are as sophisticated as the age they reflect.Antic Hayis a novel for the enlightened modern. (Spring 1936)",

      "The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf invited Lewis Gannett to write an introduction to a forthcoming ML title of his choice. He selectedAntic Hayas the most appealing but was disappointed with the $50 fee; he had assumed the ML paid more.",
      "Antic Haysold 3,427 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. Huxley’sPoint Counter Point(203) sold 7,733 copies—more than twice as many asAntic Hay—during the same period.Antic Haywas not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
      "Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and publishing rights to Huxley’s older books to Harper & Bros. in 1939. Harper’s considered withdrawingAntic HayandPoint Counter Pointfrom the ML, but Klopfer was able to negotiate new reprint contracts (see 203). New five-year contracts for the books were sent to Harper’s on 30 March 1939. TheAntic Haycontract called for the ML to pay a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least 2,500 copies after three years.",

It is not known whether Harper’s acquired the original Chatto & Windus plates or had duplicates made. In 1948 William H. Rose of Harper & Bros. wrote Klopfer that new plates were needed forAntic Hayand asked if the ML would share the cost (Rose to Klopfer, 7 June 1948). The plates were being used primarily by the ML, and Klopfer agreed to contribute $500 over a five-year period. During that time the ML paid an extra 2 cents a copy above the regular 10-cent royalty rate; any balance remaining was to be paid at the end of five years. The ML still owed $180 in 1953, so the ML appears to have sold 16,000 copies during that period (Rose to Klopfer, 23 July 1953).",

The result was one of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf considered doing the same forPenguin Island(Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4 November 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML.

      "The anthologist does not live who can compile a collection of short stories and avoid loud protests for his omissions. In the field of the German short story the choice is so wide that an inclusion of all favorites would make a volume of encyclopedic bulk. This anthology puts forth a comprehensive group of short novels and tales, selected primarily because they are representative of the main currents of German literature and those great national figures—Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Zweig and others—who made it the world’s heritage.

      "Thomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology of German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February 1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed responsibility for the anthology:",
      "It was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a considerable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He expressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract was duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still roaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled. At long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German authors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with the job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to gather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and exercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to the publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the wastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)",
      "Hitler came to power shortly beforeGreat German Short Novels and Storieswas published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the volume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf, 17 April 1933).",
      "WhenGreat German Short Novels and Storieswas being planned Cerf contacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’sDeath in Venice, offering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a Thomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been published in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf had published Kenneth Burke’s translation ofDeath in Veniceas a separate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T. Lowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the out-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.",

      "As story aloneVanity Fairis read and cherished by each new generation with increased absorption and admiration. One hundred years after its first publication it still retains its original vitality and makes the world in which Becky Sharp and its many other memorable characters lived as meaningful as our own. Few, if any, novels in English give so comprehensive a picture of the structure of its society, ranging from the aristocracy, the gentry, the merchants, the military, the colonials and the bohemians to the lowly and the impecunious.Vanity Fairis a panoramic novel that makes a startling commentary on its own times and customs with wit and audacity and perception. It is one of the imperishable classics of English fiction. This volume is embellished by Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches. (Spring 1951)",
      "Front flap rewritten:",
      "When it was written over one hundred years ago, Thackeray describedVanity Fairas “a novel without a hero.” If it did lack a central protagonist, his great work more than compensated for this deliberate omission with a gallery of memorable characters now known and beloved by readers of every shade of taste and opinion. To be able to issueVanity Fair, with Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches, in a single volume of 784 [sic] pages, complete and unabridged, fulfills the first aim of the Modern Library: to make available the greatest book treasures of the past and present in a convenient and inexpensive form. (Fall 1954)",
      "Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.",
      "Early in 1950 Stein contacted Gordon S. Ray, chairman of the English department at the University of Illinois and the preeminent Thackeray scholar in the United States, to see if he would be willing to write an introduction to the MLCE edition ofVanity Fairinstead of Thackeray’sHistory of Henry Esmond(297) as previously arranged. Stein described the conversation in a memo to Haas:",
      "What came back over the telephone wire was a very blistering attack upon our edition of VANITY FAIR. He said that he uses the edition in his classes with reluctance and that he always apologizes to them for having to use it. His principal points of complaint are:",
      "1) Our edition is not based on the final text.",
      "2) Our edition does not include Thackeray’s own preface to the book.",
      "3) Our edition is full of typographic errors.",
      "4) We do not reproduce Thackeray’s own illustrations.",
      "I am checking into the text of VANITY FAIR to find out exactly what is involved in producing a completely satisfactory book and will let you know within a few days what I turn up. Next Friday Ray will be in town and I have an appointment with him. Naturally I hope that I can at that time assure him that we will put out a completely satisfactory edition. At the moment the principal inexpensive editions of VANITY FAIR that are available are Modern Library, Everyman’s Library, and Great Illustrated Classics (Dodd, Mead, $2.50). Neither Harper nor Rinehart has an edition of VANITY FAIR available right now, but Rinehart does have one in preparation. It seems imperative therefore that we have our edition of VANITY FAIR in improved form available this fall (Stein memo to Haas, 10 February 1950).",
      "Ray indicated that the 1864 edition with revisions by Thackeray should be followed. Stein believed that the text of the 1933 ML edition followed Thackeray’s original text as published in parts, 1847–48. At first he hoped that the existing plates could be used for the new ML edition. He told Ray, “Naturally I don’t want our text to be one which does not have scholarly approval. I don’t know yet whether a collation or a resetting is our solution but we will do one or the other to bring the text completely in line with the 1864 version. Because of production costs I am not sure yet that the illustrations, vignettes and initial letters can be included in as moderately priced a book as we plan to have” (Stein to Ray, 28 March 1950).",
      "In the end the ML reset the text (Stein to Ray, 20 June 1950) and included eight of Thackeray’s illustrations along with facsimiles of the title page of the first edition and the wrapper of one of the original monthly parts. Earlier ML printings (258.1) included the two facsimiles and three of Thackeray’s illustrations.",
      "Ray appears to have declined Stein’s suggestion that he write an introduction toVanity Fairinstead ofHistory of Henry Esmond, and Stein offered Joseph Warren Beach $200 to write the introduction. Beach replied that he would take on the assignment for $500 but later agreed to accept the amount offered (Stein to Beach, 25 January 1950; Beach to Stein, 27 January 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 27 February 1950).",
      "The ML’s goal, Stein told Beach, was to produce “an inviting edition that can be enjoyed by the American student as a novel as readable today as it was a century ago” (Stein to Beach, 23 May 1950). The Note on the Text stated:",
      "The present Modern Library edition ofVanity Fairis based on the 1864 edition, which represents the final revisions made by Thackeray, and is preferable to earlier editions as representing what Thackeray considered improvements. Certain obvious misprints in the earlier and later editions have been corrected. In the case of certain doubtful readings we have followed the Oxford edition ofVanity Fairedited by Saintsbury in 1908, but we have not always accepted Saintsbury’s emendations. A few of Thackeray’s own full-page illustrations, of which there were some forty in all, have been included—enough to give a notion of the quaint visual aids offered the reader of what Thackeray called “these histories in their gaudy yellow covers”; but considerations of expense make it impossible to include the still more numerous sketches at the head of each chapter or set into the text.

      "“Three Lives,” says the Saturday Review, “stands as a massive doorpost in the entrance to the latest and best in American literature.” The book has had a curious history. Readers who were baffled by Gertrude Stein’s later work were afraid to tackle it. Twice it was allowed to go out of print altogether. Each time, however, enthusiastic admirers created sufficient demand to warrant new printings. The emphatic success of Miss Stein’s autobiography must finally win for this splendid book the wide audience that is its due. (Fall 1933)",
      "Originally published by Grafton Press, 1909. Reprinted by Albert & Charles Boni, 1927. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–279) printed from Grafton/Boni plates. Published September 1933.WR7 October 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941.",
      "After Harcourt, Brace & Co. published Stein’sAutobiography of Alice B. Toklasin 1933, Carl Van Vechten suggested that the ML bring out some of Stein’s earlier work. Cerf cabled Stein in Paris about a ML edition ofThreeLives(Cerf,At Random, p. 101). RH subsequently became Stein’s regular publisher, and a warm friendship developed between Cerf and Stein.",
      "The ML acquired the plates and full publishing rights toThree Lives, and Van Vechten wrote a new introduction for the ML edition. Cerf informed Stein a month after publication that “the book is proving to be a tremendous success for us. It is causing more comment than any new Modern Library title in the past two years. The firm of R. H. Macy & Co., which has probably the largest book department in the world today, has bought the astonishing number of 1300 copies of this little book since publication day less than a month ago. The total sale to date is over 4500 copies” (Cerf to Stein, 23 October 1933).",
      "Sales appear to have dropped off in the later 1930s, andThree Liveswas discontinued at the end of 1940. Cerf persuaded James Laughlin of New Directions to addThree Livesto their New Classics series in 1941. New Directions used the ML’s plates, including Van Vechten’s introduction, and paid the ML a $250 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf told Stein that she would receive $125 (her half of the advance) from the New Directions edition in the next year alone (Cerf to Stein, 17 September 1941).",

The advance was reduced to $1,000 in the contract dated 17 May 1933.

The following April he reported that the Star edition was out of print and thatEminent Victorianswas available whenever the ML wanted it (Harcourt to Cerf, 21 April 1933).

To the task of putting an end to this kind of literary abomination, Lytton Strachey brought many special qualifications. Of these, the most notable were his acute sense of the past, a scholarship both accurate and spirited, and a vivid style. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s graphic and vitalizing methods, and the current enthusiasm for works of biography is directly traceable to his innovations.

The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year and specified that the ML edition could not be published before October 1933.

      "The Enormous Roomis a book of immense proportions. Only in a narrow sense is it an indictment of war. The filth and the futility of war are pitilessly revealed, but even more is it a revelation of the debasement and glory of youth. Written with a fiery imagination and the keenest sensitiveness, it is none the less a book of the most spontaneous realism, and as such holds through the years a place by itself among the few important books produced by the World War.

      "Cerf rejectedThe Enormous Roomwhen Cummings’s agent suggested a ML edition in 1928: “I never considered E. E.

      "Among the few important novels which have survived since the end of World War One,The Enormous Roomstill holds a distinguished place in American fiction. Although it reveals the filth and futility of war pitilessly, it is not essentially a war novel; it is, rather, an affirmation of the aspirations and an interpretation of the thwartings of young men confronted by the fierce reality of battle, the taut periods of preparation for conflict and the grim aftermath of trial by fire.

      "It is not without reason thatThe Good Earthhas been the most successful book sinceQuo Vadis, 38 years ago. Its immense popularity can be attributed to the humanity of the people who come to life in its pages and to the Biblical simplicity of its writing. It is a book that takes root deep in the heart of mankind.The Good Earthis more than a mere portrayal of Oriental life; it is the epic of man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world. (Spring 1934)",

      "The ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major best-seller likeThe Good Earth, which headed the best-seller list for two years (1931–32). Grosset & Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher of hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap between its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint rights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933 about a ML edition ofThe Good Earth, he was told that it would be many months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf to Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January 1933). Arrangements were made later that year forThe Good Earthto appear first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and shortly thereafter in the ML.",
      "Buck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long letter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies to Her Chinese Critic” in theNew York Times Book Review(15 January 1933).",
      "Three months after Pocket Books publishedThe Good Earthas a twenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this book holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many other editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our Modern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative sales figures for the Grosset & Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for the eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following: Grosset & Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH box 141, folder D1).",
      "Sales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War, reflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced interest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

      "The great and lasting popularity ofThe Good Earthcan be attributed to the simple humanity of the people who come to life in its pages. Written in 1930, this novel brought Pearl S. Buck to the admiring attention of the world and was influential, eighteen years later, in earning for her the Nobel Prize for Literature. She was the first and only American woman so to be honored. Author of many books sinceThe Good Earth, Pearl S. Buck is almost always identified with and remembered by this epic of the soil. It is a novel that has taken root and has grown in strength with the passage of the years. Far more than a portrayal of Oriental life,The GoodEarthis the ever-heroic story of man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world. (Fall 1953)",

It is not known whether the ML made duplicates of the Grosset & Dunlap plates or whether the two sets of plates were made at the same time.",
      "The new typesetting replaces Buck’s introduction with a one-page foreword by Buck dated September 1944. By eliminating running heads and increasing the lines of text on each page from 31 to 37, the new typesetting reduces the length of for Buck’s text by 61 pages.",

      "The selection of a detective story for inclusion in the Modern Library series provided an embarrassment of riches. Yet there was neither hesitation nor reservation in the choice ofThe Maltese Falcon. Its authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (Spring 1934)",
      "Originally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition (pp. [v], [xi]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934.WR31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949.",
      "Hammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people who served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite a few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your private detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my colleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp. viii–ix).",
      "The Maltese Falconwas originally published as a five-part serial (September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazineBlack Mask. “The book was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two thousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the changes were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to have been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).",
      "There were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and fifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (The Maltese Falcon, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title page verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first in the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been examined.",
      "The ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version starring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period. The 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears to have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued in 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950).

      "When the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, through its agent, John S. Sumner, brought an action for the suppression ofGod’s Little Acreon an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case, declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.” The Modern Library now addsGod’s Little Acreto its list as a serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (Spring 1934)",

      "Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them. I hope so. (p. ix)",
      "The hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition was realized most fully after the introduction of mass market paperbacks. The paperback edition ofGod’s Little Acre, published in 1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by Penguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its first nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern paperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million copies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).",
      "The biographical note and bibliography on p. [vi] were updated at Caldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27 December 1938). The plates and publishing rights toGod’s Little Acrewere transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall 1939 and passed to Little, Brown & Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged its printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one printing under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.",
      "The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted that the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934 and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12 cents a copy.",
      "The ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

      "Jurgenwas one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure after they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a $5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice he offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’sCream of the JestorThe Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck(Cerf to Mr. [Guy] Holt, McBride, 29 July 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition ofBeyond Life(104) two years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint editions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained strong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition of Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).",
      "McBride authorized a ML edition ofThe Cream of the Jest(131) in 1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer forJurgen, but the response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12 cents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to permit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least for the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and particularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so profitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way – this despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the sale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer to Rose, 27 March 1928).",
      "Grosset & Dunlap published a reprint edition ofJurgenin its Novels of Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in publishingJurgenin the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker, McBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed when the Grosset & Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months later, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we can get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset & Dunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset & Dunlap wrote McBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t directly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset & Dunlap to McBride & Co., 16 November 1933).",

Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML edition of Norris’sMcTeagueorTheOctopusthree years earlier (Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff sent copies ofThe PitandMcTeaguefor his consideration. He noted thatThe Pithad sold 189,455 copies in all editions whileMcTeaguehad sold 67,272 copies andThe Octopushad sold 59,779 copies (de Graff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided thatThe Pit“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July 1933). He appears to have been unaware thatMcTeague(57) was in the ML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni & Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.",
      "The plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition ofThe Pitwere too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would have to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would share the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think, making some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.). Meanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original plates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the Modern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios in small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty bad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you think, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent looking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing Co., 29 August 1933).",
      "Publication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed until August; Dickens’sDavid Copperfield(269), originally scheduled for August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production ofThe Pitappears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end of April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to use” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was made to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928 Argonaut edition.The Pitappears to have been the first ML title printed by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but it would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and make new letterpress plates.",
      "Sales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing.The Pitwas discontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first ML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.",

      "The Great Gatsbyis a story of the fabulous 1920s, that incredible period in American history that ended in a crash from which we are all reeling still. The editors ofTimeMagazine report that Gatsby was the “first racketeer in United States fiction.” Countless novels and motion pictures have followed the pattern since, butThe Great Gatsbyremains the most brilliant and understanding portrait of the first mad days of the bootleg era. It is by all odds Scott Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the development of American literature can afford to overlook. (Fall 1934)",
      "Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.WR29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939.",
      "Maxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML edition ofThe Great Gatsby. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to announce the forthcoming publication ofTender Is the Night, which appeared initially as a serial inScribner’s Magazine, and added: “If it goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why don’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by Gertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter ofThe Great Gatsbyand wrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it had brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was “creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see Tanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted to publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald $50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934). Including his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300 from the ML edition.",
      "Fitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our series” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf about the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off writing it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of the approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week. He appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs of the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the corrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the introduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).",
      "The ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original introductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni & Liveright era, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction toSouth Wind(114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition ofMrs. Dalloway(168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of this genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction toThe Great Gatsbywas one of the worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future printings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like the preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and incoherance [sic], two qualities which the story that succeeds it manages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to reassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to Fitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared, “The prefaceisincoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but simply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).",
      "A 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is inscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in Tryon [North Carolina]” with the additional annotation at the top of p. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington, London; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the ML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of Maxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s own hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv <modlib@thuban.owu.edu>, 10 November 2011).",
      "Tender Is the Night, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published in April 1934, five months before the ML edition ofThe Great Gatsby. By 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent Cerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition ofTender Is the Nightif he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now are essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the correspondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the preceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he wrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity . . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than one in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads them to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell Perkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishingThis Side of Paradise,The Great Gatsby, andTender Is the Nightas an omnibus volume in the ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli,Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).",
      "Sales ofThe Great Gatsbywere disappointing. The ML edition sold about 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal enthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest sellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott Fitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, 31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By the early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition ofThe Great Gatsbywas selling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).",
      "There was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 afterThe Great Gatsbywas discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are stamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as remainders.",

The book had better be good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933).

Published in 1919, and written before the rise of an official Communist version of these events (Trotsky here still stands beside Lenin, and Stalin is nowhere to be found), it still retains its value as history; but more important than this, it helped create an image, a myth, of the Bolshevik Revolution which was enormously influential in America, in other countries where the book was widely circulated, and in Communist Russia itself, where it was translated by Lenin’s wife and introduced enthusiastically by Lenin.",

WhenRoan Stallion,Tamar and Other Poemswas first published a new and elemental force in our native poetry was acclaimed. The fierce tragedies enacted against a background of the rocky landscape of the Pacific Ocean revealed the brooding and tortured men and women whose hearts Jeffers searched. In poem after poem over many years, he has explored the dark labyrinths of the human spirit. Without compromise or concession he has pursued his search and written about the stark beauty of a rugged landscape and the agonized gropings of a people at war with their environment and themselves.

Edward Newton in the most fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality ofThe Amenities of Book-Collectingmade it the unanimous choice of the editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to be welcomed into the series. (Fall 1935)",
      "Originally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression published by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. [7], [16]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a black-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the Atlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and printed with the text. Published December 1935.WR14 December 1935. First printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.",
      "Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights toThe Amenities of Book-Collectingwhen they acquired the ML, but the original edition was still selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24 August 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just returned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we had a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that time I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library edition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to you and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about it” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he would be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25 February 1935).",
      "The Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf initially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he wanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750 against royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay only 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after which the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think that Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure that every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale of at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the book is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the pages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).",
      "Cerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the $750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset “would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result may not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough to suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The Polygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the plates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work, including all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints (make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408 for 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).",
      "Newton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf invited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant not only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but special attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words, the new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new review of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to Newton, 25 April 1935)."

      "The Possessedwas written between 1870 and 1872, years in which the just-beginning Russian revolutionary movement first exploded in acts of violence. The actual murder of a member of a revolutionary circle by his fellow conspirators first gave Dostoyevsky the idea for the book in which he turned against the radicals and socialists with whom he had earlier identified. As Avrahm Yarmolinsky observes in his Foreword, “The Possessedtestifies to the fact that Dostoyevsky was not without some insight into the nature of the upheaval from which he was separated by nearly half a century.” Revolution, however, is not the sole theme of this novel, rich in insight, imaginative power and strongly drawn characters, which ranks with Dostoyevsky’s major works.",

Confronted with an embarrassment of riches in making a choice among so many novels, this selection was made because it most completely embodies the spirit and substance of Henry James’ unique gifts. The recognition given him by discriminating readers during the last part of the nineteenth century promises to be renewed in the twentieth. (Spring 1936)",
      "Originally published in U.S. by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1881. ML edition (291.1, pp. [7]–[428]; [1]–[438]) printed from Houghton Mifflin plates. Published April 1936.WR25 April 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissued 1983.",
      "WhenDaisy Miller & An International Episode(60) was discontinued in 1934, the ML was left with a single James volume,Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master(189). Klopfer then contacted Houghton Mifflin: “It occurred to me that it is just about time for us to get a decent Henry James title in the Modern Library.” He expressed interest inThe Portrait of a LadyorThe Tragic Museprovided the plates fit the ML’s format and offered royalties of 10 cents a copy (Klopfer to Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 6 June 1934). Linscott replied that nothing could be done for a year. Houghton Mifflin had just concluded “a long and difficult negotiation” with the James family to bring out a less expensive edition ofThe Portrait of a Lady, and Ferris Greenslet, general manager of the trade department, did not want to undertake another campaign just then (Linscott to Klopfer, 11 June 1934).",
      "Three years after the ML edition was published, Linscott showed Klopfer the Houghton Mifflin sales figures forThe Portrait of a Ladyfor the preceding twelve years (Linscott to Klopfer, 23 May 1939). The figures illustrate the effect of the ML edition on sales of the original publisher’s edition: 510 copies (1927), 509 copies (1928), 400 copies (1929), 402 copies (1930), 309 copies (1931), 192 copies (1932), 112 copies (1933), 155 copies (1934), 158 copies (1935), 93 copies (1936, when the ML edition appeared), 82 copies (1937), 89 copies (1938).",
      "The Portrait of a Ladysold 4,308 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales increased by the early 1950s. It sold 5,345 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it thirty-ninth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.",

      "Originally published with Millett’s introduction and bibliography in MLCE, 1951, and subsequently in the regular ML. Stein offered Millett $200 to write an introduction of 3,000–5,000 words (Stein to Millett, 28 June 1950). Millett submitted an essay two-and-a-half times the length requested and indicated that Stein could cut it (Millett to Stein, 3 October 1950). The first part was a sketch of James’s life and works, the second part provided an account of the writing of the novel and James’s opinion of it at various times, and the third part consisted of a critical discussion of the work in light of James’s own criteria and the expectations of the modern reader. Both Stein and Linscott (who had moved to RH from Houghton Mifflin in 1944) were enthusiastic about the introduction but thought it had to be cut. Stein suggested leaving part 3 largely as it stood, cutting part 1 from 3,000 to 1,000 words, and eliminating most of part 2. He urged Millett to publish the entire essay in a journal likeKenyon RevieworSewanee Review(Millett to Stein, 3 October 1950; Millett to Stein 12 October 1950; Stein to Millett, 25 October 1950).",

Through the finely drawn figure of Isabel Archer, “a certain young woman affronting her destiny” in Europe, and his mastery of interpersonal relationships to objectify her maturing moral sense, James has produced a triumph of psychological realism that fulfills his own demands of the art form by being both “interesting” and “amusing.” In an exquisite prose style—sensitive, subtle, and perfectly controlled—The Portrait of a Ladyis one of the most enduring representations of women in Western literature, and ranks as one of the finest novels written in the English language.",

      "The only quarrel among Trollope enthusiasts revolves around the preference betweenBarchester TowersandThe Warden. The editors of the Modern Library serve both factions by including the two novels in a single volume, not so much to placate the embattled Trollopians, but becauseBarchester Towersis, by the author’s own intention, inseparable fromThe Warden, and is its sequel. A. Edward Newton, author ofThe Amenities of Book-Collectingand founder of The Trollope Society, contributes a glowing introduction to this volume. (Spring 1936)",

      "Cerf wrote to Newton after the announcement of ML’s spring list: “I am amazed and delighted at the interest that has been evinced at the mere announcement of the first Trollope title in our Modern Library series. We have announced the book for May publication, but it seems if we can get it ready five or six weeks before that time, we may be able to bag a few big school orders for the book. Accordingly, I would esteem it a tremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in the course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of February. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get all the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January 1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML edition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date of the 25th of the month.",
      "The Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily accessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped that an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It appeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER TOWERS are published under the patronage of The Trollope Society” (p. [iv]). Klopfer expressed the hope that the ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer to Newton, 12 March 1936). But sales were disappointing and no further works by Trollope were added to the series untilThe Way We Live Now(639) appeared in 1984.",

      "No writer of our time has so vividly dramatized the living spirit of revolution, nor so completely identified himself with the struggle for a new social order as André Malraux.Man’s Fate, dealing with the 1925–1927 uprising in China, is, indeed, more than a novel of the fierce conflicts that tore a vast country asunder; it is a revelation of man’s courage and heroism in the face of imminent annihilation. Winner of the Goncourt Prize for 1933,Man’s Fateestablished André Malraux as one of the leading novelists of France and the world. (Fall 1936)",

      "Man’s Fatewas the first Smith and Haas title added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer absorbed the firm in April 1936.",
      "The Smith and Haas edition measured 8⅜ x 5¾ inches with a type page of 6⅜ by 3⅝ inches. The plates were far too large for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch format. To includeMan’s Fatein the series the ML would either have to reset the text and make new letterpress plates or photograph a clean copy of the Smith and Haas edition, reduce the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography. The quality of offset lithographic printing in the 1930s was inferior to letterpress and the cost of each print run was higher, but photographing an existing book was significantly cheaper than making a new typesetting. There were at least two printings of 294a from offset plates, including a September 1939 printing of 3,000 copies.",
      "The introduction of the larger ML format in fall 1939 made it possible, with uncomfortably narrow margins, to use the original letterpress plates for subsequent ML printings (294b–c). With a top margin that averaged about ¼ in. (6 mm), letterpress printings in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s were not examples of fine bookmaking. The ML reverted to offset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing dropped below that of letterpress.Man’s Fateis the only ML title to have been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress, and again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are photographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making printings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of comfortable margins and freshness of the type.",
      "The ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or to Gallimard, the French publisher ofLa Condition humaine.",

Crowder to Cerf, 1 October 1934), and W. W. Norton appears to have suggested a ML reprint. Cerf expressed reservations about its sales potential: “May I ask you on what terms you will be prepared to let us publish MAURICE GUEST in the Modern Library this Fall? I agree with you that it is a fine book, but am a little doubtful as to just how big a seller it would be” (Cerf to Walter Norton, W. W. Norton & Co., 2 January 1936).",
      "Henry Handel Richardson was the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson. Commins identified the author as Henrietta Richardson in the first draft of his biographical note and indicated that “Handel” had been taken from the name of the composer. Norton asked Cerf to omit the reference since neither Norton nor Heinemann, her English publisher, had ever made Richardson’s identity public. He also pointed out that she had been married for over thirty years to an important figure in English letters (the philologist John George Robertson) and was no longer Miss Richardson (Norton to Cerf, 28 July 1936). Commins left in the reference to “Miss Richardson” but omitted information about to her real name.",

      "The foremost authorities of the world are in agreement thatThe Charterhouse of Parmais one of the great works of fiction in the French language. Such writers as Balzac, Nietzsche, Zola, Dowden, André Gide and Lytton Strachey acclaimed it.The Charterhouse of Parmafinds a distinguished place in the Modern Library series. WithThe Red and the Black(No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (Fall 1936)",
      "Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni & Liveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 ofThe Works of Stendhal. ML edition (pp. [v]–290; [1]–343) printed from B&L plates. Published January 1937.WR23 January 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1943.",
      "Arthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to secure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the reprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an introduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured Cerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to Cerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline;The Charterhouse of Parmawent to press without an introduction, and sales were disappointing.",
      "Total printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March 1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold copies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth format, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in the larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information about Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears under “General” in the chapter for 1939.)",
      "Wartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading matter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to dropThe Charterhouse of Parma, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to other titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in fall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among academics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by George Mayberry in theNew Republic(8 November 1943, p. 661):",
      "An Open Letter",
      "The Modern Library, Inc.,",
      "New York City.",
      "Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August 15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for comment.",
      "One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed.",
      "You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness.",
      "May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up remaindered copies at Macy’s.",
      "George Mayberry",
      "Cerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by Mayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,”New Republic, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):",
      "Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken?",
      "The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in 1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year, when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for somewhere between four and five years. [This statement was not strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time.]",
      "May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial period in actual sales.",
      "Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s “The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library. Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The Charterhouse of Parma.”",
      "BENNETT A. CERF",
      "Mayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:",
      "[I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep “such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the Modern Library.  —G.M.]",
      "Intellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation ofThe Charterhouse of Parmabecame a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little magazinePharospublished a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry Levin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the publishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against their country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s masterpieceThe Charterhouse of Parmabecause they thought they were unable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature asLife with FatherandRebecca” (Pharos, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).",
      "Levin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which consisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”: “. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English, in spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in America, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal has received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).",
      "James T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization of publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in recent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their stock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing? Some Observations on the Future of Books,”New Directions9, 1946, p. 13).",
      "When Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality” or “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a claim to the intellectual audience by makingThe Charterhouse of Parmahis first title.",
      "In 1999, fifty-six years afterThe Charterhouse of Parmawas discontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by Richard Howard. That edition, in paperback, was in print as of 2016.",

      "Tortilla Flat, which appeared in 1935, was the first of Steinbeck’s novels to receive wide attention. He was disturbed by the response to this portrait of a group of carefreepaisanosin a Monterey slum, writing two years later that “I shall never again subject to the vulgar touch of thedecentthese good people of laughter and kindness, of honest lusts and direct eyes, of courtesy beyond politeness.” If today, Steinbeck’s own view of Danny and his friends seems to some shallow and condescending, that is a measure of the time in which he wrote and the impact of his writing on the change in our attitudes. Steinbeck tells this story with warmth and liveliness, and it remains a document of a period when even this glimpse of a different slice of life could be considered shocking.",

      "To collect the representative writings of Henry David Thoreau within a volume of seven hundred and fifty pages has long been the ambition of the directors of the Modern Library. Now that ambition has been fulfilled, thanks to the selection made by the editor, Brooks Atkinson, who also contributes a penetrating critical and biographical introduction. This volume contains, besidesWalden, the essaysCivil Disobedience,Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Life Without Principleand many of the famous nature studies. (Fall 1937)",

      "The ML and Houghton Mifflin Co. both published Thoreau collections in September 1937. When the ML edition was announced, Robert Linscott of Houghton Mifflin told Klopfer that his firm was “rather daunted” by the news. Houghton Mifflin had thought that the ML was giving up its collection and would have abandonedThe Works of Thoreau, an 872-page volume edited by Henry Seidel Canby, if it had known the ML was going ahead. The Houghton Mifflin collection included selections from Thoreau’s journals, which were still protected by copyright and had not been available to the ML. Linscott offered to lease the plates of Canby’s volume to the ML within eighteen months if the ML gave up its volume (Linscott to Klopfer, 7 July 1937). Klopfer replied that the ML had changed its plans as much as it could when the conflict was discovered and expressed the hope that the two books would not interfere with each other (Klopfer to Linscott, 8 July 1937).",
      "When the Viking Portable Thoreau appeared in 1949, Brooks Atkinson told Cerf that it was “such a good job that your Modern Library Thoreau volume is behind the eight-ball.” He suggested replacing the selections fromA Week on the Concord and Merrimack Riverson pp. 301–436 with the complete work (Atkinson to Cerf, 4 March 1949). Commins replied that he hoped Atkinson would allow the ML edition to remain unchanged. The complete text ofA Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, he noted, would add 200 pages to the collection, at a resetting cost of around $2,000; changing the page numerals from p. 437 to the end would cost an additional $200 or $300 (Commins to Atkinson, 1 April 1949). The ML never acted on Atkinson’s suggestion.",
      "Walden and Other Writingssold over 6,000 copies by early 1939 (Cerf to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). It sold 11,558 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ninth best-selling title in the regular ML. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,694 copies, making it the regular ML’s thirty-second best-selling title.",

Thoreau spent his life listening to “a different drummer,” and in following his belief that the individual could lead a life of simplicity and independence apart from social organization and material civilization, he anticipated one of the major themes of contemporary America.

Following the publication ofThe 42nd Parallel,1919andThe Big Moneywill be issued in successive seasons. By this plan, John Dos Passos’ original intention of maintaining the unity of the three novels will be fulfilled. (Fall 1937)",

First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940 after the ML publishedU.S.A.as a Giant (G42).",

The ML appears to have offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for each volume. Cerf indicated after signing the reprint contract, “I am really delighted that we are going to have these books in the Modern Library. John Dos Passos is exactly the kind of author that we can sell in this series” (Cerf to Donald Brace, 13 May 1937).",
      "Harcourt, Brace resetThe 42nd Parallel, incorporating corrections of a large number of typographical errors submitted by Dos Passos. The ML edition was the first printing from the new typesetting. Dos Passos had also made extensive revisions for the ML edition ofThree Soldiers(248).",
      "Cerf asked Dos Passos to write a short foreword to the ML edition ofThe 42nd Parallel, noting that he believed his foreword to the ML edition ofThree Soldiers(248) “materially helped the sale of the book.” He offered the usual $50 fee with the apology that the ML couldn’t afford more but enclosed a ML list and invited Dos Passos to select any books he wanted (Cerf to Dos Passos, ibid.). Dos Passos eventually selected about a hundred titles. He promised to send a short introduction and noted, “I’m not quite sure whether this is the time to spill the fact that the narratives will be collected into a one volume novel under the name ofU.S.A.or not” (Dos Passos to Cerf, 4 July 1937).",
      "The introduction to the ML edition, dated July 1937, begins:",
      "The 42nd Parallelis the first volume ofU. S. A., a long narrative which deals with the more or less entangled lives of a number of Americans during the first three decades of the present century. The volumes that follow are called1919andThe Big Money.",
      "In an effort to take in as much as possible of the broad field of the lives of these times, three separate sequences have been threaded in and out among the stories. Of theseThe Camera Eyeaims to indicate the position of the observer andNewsreelto give an inkling of the common mind of the epoch. Portraits of a number of real people are interlarded in the pauses in the narrative because their lives seem to embody so well the quality of the soil in which Americans of these generations grew.",
      "This method was used with the idea of coping with the particular job in hand rather than from any generalized theory about novelwriting [sic]. In fact I don’t think any such theory holds water. The shape of a piece of work should be imposed, and in a good piece of work always is imposed, by the matter. That’s more or less of a commonplace of a considerable body of literary criticism.",
      "The ML later renegotiated the reprint contract so that the trilogy could appear as a Giant rather than separate volumes in the regular ML.U.S.A.(G42) was published as a Giant in February 1939, andThe 42nd Parallelwas discontinued as a separate volume in fall 1940.",

George, who is short-tempered, relies on Lennie’s great physical strength for protection and in turn tries to keep his feeble-minded friend out of trouble.

      "While working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough to think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on Confucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and besides the introduction, it will be principally the work of translating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript will be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January 1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s financial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He received $300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April 1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a flat fee or was an advance against royalties.",
      "Lin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did not read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the collection appears to have been challenged.

      "“Confucianism stood for a rationalized social order through the ethical approach, based on personal cultivation. It aimed at political order by laying the basis for it in a moral order, and it sought political harmony by trying to achieve the moral harmony in man himself. . . . Fundamentally, it was a humanist attitude, brushing aside all futile metaphysics and mysticism, interested chiefly in the essential human relationships, and not in the world of spirits or in immortality. The strongest doctrine of this particular type of humanism, which accounts for its great enduring influence, is the doctrine that ‘the measure of man is man,’ a doctrine which makes it possible for the common man to begin somewhere as a follower of Confucianism by merely following the highest instincts of his own human nature, and not by looking for perfection in a divine ideal.”",

Van Gogh worked, fought and created with some of the most celebrated men of the century: Gauguin, Zola, Cezanne; and he lived with some of the most abject human beings of his time. In the pages ofLust for Life, Van Gogh is vindicated as man and artist. (Spring 1939)",

He consideredLust for Lifethe most presentable book the ML had published, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also regarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and appearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar reprint published by Grosset & Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8 February 1939).",
      "The ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It sold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML titles. Adjusted for 18 months, 1951–52 sales exceed those for 1942–43 by fewer than 100 copies; the ranking ofLust for Lifein the third quarter of ML sales during 1942–43 reflects the increase in demand for books of all kinds during the Second World War.",

The revised “Life of Izaak Walton” in 319c omits the words, “from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved.” Keynes also refers to a pastel portrait of Walton by Edmund Ashfield.

      "Keynes’s “The Life of Izaak Walton” (pp. 3–13) was revised and reset in 1948. The printing with the spring 1949 jacket is probably the first from the reset plates. The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s mother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed Keynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton, survived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of Stafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A footnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter from Arthur M. Coon of Cornell University inThe Times Literary Supplement(25 December 1937).",

This allowed larger margins, but the substantial reduction in type size made the text harder to read. A happy medium is achieved in 320d. The format is increased to 7½ x 4⅞ in., and the type page has been increased photographically to 155 x 88 mm.

      "Everyone who has been stirred by John Steinbeck’sThe Grapes of Wrathmust turn toIn Dubious Battleto discover the source from which his most famous book drew its strength and deep humanity. In all his novels Steinbeck is preeminently the story-teller. InIn Dubious Battlehe is at the crest of his powers as he dramatizes the plight of men and women fighting for their lives. A common cause animates their struggle, and their heroism makes the narrative soar from climax to climax. (Fall 1939)",

      "The ML secured exclusive reprint rights toIn Dubious Battleshortly before the publication ofThe Grapes of Wrathin 1939 vastly enlarged Steinbeck’s audience. An earlier reprint had been published by Blue Ribbon Books in October 1937, but it sold poorly and was out of print by November 1938. Lewis Miller expected the success ofThe Grapes of Wrathto stimulate interest in all of Steinbeck’s books (Miller to Crowder, 11 July 1939). In a memo to the sales force he urged the travelers to open their sales talks withIn Dubious Battle:",
      "We got the sole reprint rights before GRAPES OF WRATH leaped to best-sellerdom and very lucky, too, for I am convinced it would have been more advantageous to the Viking crowd to have given the book to Grosset as well as to us. We would in that case have shared the market and perhaps not a big share either. If Grosset had IN DUBIOUS BATTLE they would get an advance of 20,000 to 25,000 copies, in my judgment. We are looking for an 8,000 to 10,000 advance on the strength of the fact that this brand new army of Steinbeck readers is now wide open for his past work. Every bookstore you call on has sold good quantities of GRAPES OF WRATH and that’s the market for IN DUBIOUS BATTLE. . . . Remember that IN DUBIOUS BATTLE does not take up much room and you have got to get at least a 25-stack if you expect the public to see it. We want 25’s, 50’s and 100’s. If a dealer buries this title on a shelf in 1’s and 2’s, we are licked before we start. (RH Box 153, Sales folder)",
      "The ML distributed a four-color display poster to bookstores that describedIn Dubious Battleas “a long, full, satisfying novel that deals with the same kind of characters and the same background as THE GRAPES OF WRATH” and launched a $7,500 advertising campaign that featuredIn Dubious Battlealong with Steinbeck’s other ML titles,Tortilla FlatandOf Mice and Men(PW, 5 August 1939, p. 351). A special discount was offered for combination orders of all three Steinbeck titles: 41 percent for 50 copies, 40 + 5 percent for 100 copies, and 44 percent for of 250 copies. The 40 + 5 percent discount was normally reserved for the ML’s biggest customers, such as Brentano’s, Macy’s, and Marshall Field & Co., who obtained ML books (list price 95 cents) for 55 cents instead of the 57 cents paid by booksellers who got a straight 40 percent discount. Booksellers who received this discount were expected to promote the series aggressively.",
      "“You can see the leverage you get with such a schedule,” Miller told the travelers. “You may get a dealer who can buy only 25 IN DUBIOUS BATTLE and you now have got a wedge to get 25 assorted out of the other two. And so on, up the scale” (RH Box 153, Sales folder). He also reminded them, “In selling this title don’t overlook the point that, because the book will be bound in stiff covers, it lends itself admirably to lending library use in addition to over-the-counter sales” (Miller to Consolino, 31 July 1939).",
      "The Grapes of Wrathled the 1939 best-seller list and remained one of the ten best-selling fiction titles in 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29). Sales figures for the ML edition ofIn Dubious Battleare not available for 1939 and 1940. The ML edition ofIn Dubious Battlesold 6,028 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles—but by thenThe Grapes of Wrathitself was available in the ML.In Dubious Battlewas not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.",

      "Fielding himself describedJosephAndrewsas a satire “in imitation of the manner of Cervantes.” Its original purpose was to heap ridicule on the then popular romantic heroine of Samuel Richardson’sPamela. But the novel grew beyond its first intention and became more than a mere parody. In its own right it earned the status of one of the major works of fiction of the mid-eighteenth century and was the forerunner of Fielding’s masterpiece,Tom Jones(Modern Library No. 185). Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on the pretenses and follies of English society,Joseph Andrewsis a novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired. (Spring 1954)",

He noted, “I honestly think we could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to Donald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the University of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint ofThe Complete Biblewas premature, Cerf offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy forThe Short Bible(Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939). Shortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean to run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became Acting Manager of the Press.",
      "Cerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of gettingThe Complete Bible. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with Goodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the complete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to the Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from California he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and Goodspeed had decided against a ML edition ofThe Short Bible. He reported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . . you and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up the Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until we can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant edition of theComplete Bible. I told him that we both understand full well that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but if we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to guarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of our contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December 1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).",
      "Lewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead withThe Short Bible. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell well, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML rejected it, and that whichever firm gotThe Short Biblewould have a “toe-hold” onThe Complete Bible. He recommended that the ML secureThe Short Bibleon the understanding that it would getThe Complete Bibleif and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and Klopfer’s concern that a ML edition ofThe Short Biblemight injure their chances of gettingThe Complete Bibleif it sold poorly but concluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23 February 1940).",
      "Cerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three days later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract forThe Short Biblewas signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After signing Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a reprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given the first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this edition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).",
      "Two years later Cerf offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights toThe Complete Bible. Hemens replied that it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be different the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to Cerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that many readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have the complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really impressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942).The Complete Biblenever appeared in the ML.",

      "Cerf had never readThe African Queen. He asked Little, Brown for a copy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about an hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that it was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years before the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.",
      "Forester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters omitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the foreword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in writing another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the end of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end without calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was called for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and it was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I really appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked of its last two [sic] chapters. . . . So it is with very great pleasure that I welcome this reissue ofThe African Queenfor the opportunity it gives me of presenting the book in the form in which I first pictured it” (p. [8])."

      "The ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $250 advance, and Porter received $25 for her introduction. In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was pleased thatFlowering Judaswas to be included in the series. She wrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I hope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a buyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library a God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have more.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly, a kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book; authors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little on the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8 May 1940).",
      "The ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier that year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book sells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of letting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).",
      "When Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was terminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400 copies ofFlowering Judasin stock, and Klopfer estimated that it would take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued in fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’sLight in August(429), which was published in the series shortly afterFlowering Judaswas discontinued.",
      "Harcourt, Brace subsequently decided against includingFlowering Judasin Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring 1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and assignedFlowering Judasa new number (ML 284).

      "Writing ofHuman Being, Edna Ferber said: “It is a glorious book, a wise and deeply understanding book. It has a touch of God in it, and the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act of being human.

Discontinued 1 January 1946.",
      "The suggestion to includeHuman Beingin the ML came from Morley himself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):",
      "Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little to see myself represented in there only byParnassus on Wheels; a worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look at it now.",
      "I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting inHuman Being, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person; a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.",
      "Cerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be represented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I don’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be added; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley backlist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern Library” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted that he had never readHuman Beingand asked Morley to send him a copy (Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he still thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general interest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think that a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was able to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf to Morley, 30 August 1939).",
      "Morley’s novelKitty Foylewas a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuingHuman Beingin a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would prefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf agreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob [Haas] and I still think it is a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and the huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to Morley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition corrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.",
      "Human Beingsold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that category.Parnassus on Wheels(213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was the second worst-selling title.",

      "When this volume first appeared in 1934 under the Random House imprint, William Saroyan’s meteoric flight across the literary skies was begun. For a book of short stories, it had an unprecedented success and was an augury of his continuing national fame. Since then William Saroyan has maintained his position among the foremost writers of America. Winner of the Drama Critics Circle award and also winner, but scorner, of the Pulitzer Prize forThe Time of Your Life, he has achieved quite as sensational a name for himself in the field of the drama as in the short story. (Spring 1941)",

      "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapezewas one of the first trade titles published by Random House. Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to design trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the plates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such as the removal of running heads.",
      "The ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML titles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the ML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was out of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print and that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to Saroyan, 5 April 1949)."

      "The anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on the first printing of Hugo’sNotre-Dame de Paris(1831) and does not include three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in December 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and Book Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation used by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and Book Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and 5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not “augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The three added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been misplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be included in the 1832 printing (Hugo,Notre-Dame de Paris, translated and edited by John Sturrock [London: Penguin Books, 2004], pp. 26–29).",
      "The absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill That), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the printing press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the public expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during the world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan pagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of the human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious symbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own monument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191).",
      "When the ML reprintedThe Hunchback of Notre Damein 1996 as part of the “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous and incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and 1971.",
      "The Hunchback of Notre Damesold 4,004 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.

At the same time, it seeks to define the word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But above all, theRepublicis an attempt to define “justice”; by imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.",

      "The ML edition ofOracles of Nostradamuswas published two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The decision to include Nostradamus had been made before the United States entered the war.

      "The oracles of the sixteenth-century astrologer Nostradamus have exerted a great influence over the minds of men in every century since his death, and in times of war, famine, and political upheaval are read with increasing curiosity. The delphic character of the oracles makes it difficult to identify correctly each country and person described—but the disturbing accuracy of the few clearly dated prophecies has given Nostradamus added authority.",
      "The interpretive work of Charles Ward, which makes up the body of this volume, was completed in 1891. To it has been added a supplementary section of oracles, literally translated from the French, and un-interpreted, whose application to the twentieth century again arouses amazement at the uncanny foresight of Europe’s most famous seer."

Knopf had included it in a 12-volume limited edition of Crane’s works published in 1925. In the early 1930s, when Knopf was considering including it in an omnibus edition of Crane’s works, his lawyers concluded that it was in the public domain. Cerf told Knopf that he planned to offer Appleton a $600 advance against royalties of 6 cents a copy and would probably publish it in the ML without permission if Appleton rejected the offer (Cerf to Knopf, 2 December 1932). Neither Knopf nor Cerf went ahead with their plans.When the ML publishedThe Red Badge of Courageten years later it was by arrangement with Appleton-Century and printed from Appleton plates.

      "Stallman received $200 for his introduction and editorial work on the volume (Stein to Stallman, 26 June 1950). Stein, who edited Modern Library College Editions, wanted to add several stories by Crane to the volume, in part because he thought it might forestall Rinehart & Co. from bringing out a competing edition in their paperback series for the college market (Stein to Stallman, 11 July 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 28 August 1950). Stallman suggested “Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,” “The Open Boat,” “An Episode of War,” “The Upturned Face,” and “A Mystery of Heroism.” Stein hoped to secure permission to include the stories for a flat fee, but Knopf insisted on a royalty. Appleton-Century-Crofts was charging a 2-cent royalty for the use of their plates for MLCE printings. Adding the stories would have increased the royalty for MLCE printings to 4 cents a copy and also added to the cost of the regular ML edition.

      "The first American to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, Sinclair Lewis is now represented in the Modern Library series by two of his most memorable novels—Arrowsmith(No. 42) andBabbitt. His portrait of George F. Babbitt, realtor, is so firm in the minds of all English–speaking people that the name has become incorporated into the language as a permanent word. Readers of every language into whichBabbitthas been translated regard it as Sinclair Lewis’s masterpiece and have created from it a conception of an American type of the prosaic but always human business man. (Fall 1941)",
      "Originally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1922. ML edition (pp. [7]–401) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February 1942.WR14 February 1942. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1949.",
      "The first Harcourt, Brace printing, published in September 1922, exists in two states, with the second state containing two corrections on p. 49 (“Lyte” instead of “Purdy” in line 3, “any” instead of “my” in line 5). Three more corrections were made in the second printing, one correction (“for” instead of “against” on p. 392, line 1) was made in the third printing, and eleven more corrections were made in the fourth printing, making the fourth printing “the most authoritative version of the work” (John Hersey, “Note on the Texts,”Main Street & Babbitt[New York: Library of America, 1992], p. 883).",
      "Harcourt, Brace anticipated strong sales and made a duplicate set of plates, probably beforeBabbittwas published. The duplicate plates incorporate the corrections in the second state of the first printing but not those in the second, third, or fourth printings, which were made between October and November 1922. The duplicate plates or shells, which appear to have been made in July 1922, were held in reserve.",
      "When the ML negotiated reprint rights in 1941, Harcourt, Brace melted the original plates, which had become worn, and provided the duplicate plates to the ML for its printings. ML printings, as well as later printings in Harbrace Modern Classics (1950) and other reprint editions, revert to the text of the second state of the first printing, and do not include the corrections made in the second, third, and fourth printings (Matthew J. Bruccoli, “Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis’sBabbitt,”Studies in Bibliography11 (1958): 263–68; available online at http://www.bsuva.org.  For the next fifty years all American printings—including  the paperback edition in Signet Classics (1961)—appear to have omitted the corrections made to the text in the third, fourth, and fifth Harcourt, Brace printings. The corrections were restored in the Library of America edition ofMain Street & Babbitt(1992) but many subsequent editions, such as the Bantam paperback published in 1998, continued to be set from flawed earlier printings.",
      "To secureBabbittCerf agreed to a three-year reprint contract, after which Harcourt, Brace had the right to cancel the contracts for the ML editions of bothBabbittandArrowsmith, with the cancellations to be effective on the same date. He told Harcourt, “I shall be curious to see just how the Pocket Book [mass market paperback] edition of ARROWSMITH affects both your edition and ours of that book!” (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 31 July 1941).",
      "Lewis became a RH author in 1939 when he followed his editor Harry Maule from Doubleday to Random House.Arrowsmith(243) had been in the Modern Library since 1933, but Lewis wanted to have more of his books in the series. Maule conveyed the good news thatBabbittwould be added to the series: “Bennett and I thought you might be interested to know that, through some complicated horse-trading, he has finally gotten BABBITT for the Modern Library. I don’t begin to understand the convolutions by which he was able to do this, but he thinks this time it will stick” (Maule to Lewis, 1 August 1941). Lewis was “extremely glad” (Lewis to Maule, 12 August 1941).Dodsworth(348) became his third title in the series in 1947.",
      "The ML edition ofBabbittsold 5,807 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in October 1942 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in March 1943.",
      "When Harcourt, Brace launched its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, for the burgeoning college market in 1948, it served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for all of Lewis’s titles in the ML (Arrowsmith,BabbittandDodsworth) as well as five other Harcourt, Brace titles by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 4,000 copies ofBabbittin stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948). The Harbrace Modern Classics edition ofBabbitt, printed from the same plates used by the ML, was published in 1950.Dodsworthwas reprieved; it was never included in Harbrace Modern Classics and the Modern Library edition remained in print until 1970.",

But this story of crime and punishment belongs to no season. Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and scrupulous in its search for understanding of the forces that lead to tragedy, this novel is far more than a social document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by whites.

      "Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition shortly afterNative Sonwas published (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 11 April 1940). Hoyns promised to talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted that Grosset & Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright and for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied that it should be possible for both Grosset & Dunlap and the ML to do the book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on these reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new titles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit of everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940).",
      "The following year Cerf wrote to Wright hoping to secure his support for a ML edition. He indicated that he wanted to publishNative Sonin spring 1942 and invited Wright to write an introduction if a ML edition could be arranged (Cerf to Wright, 12 August 1941). Wright did not reply and Cerf wrote again on 3 September 1941. Wright does not appear to have replied to this letter either. In the end the ML reprinted the Fisher introduction from the Harper edition.",

Three years later the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of $1,000 against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased to 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available and in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format. Scribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to recover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman edited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional payment for the ML edition.",
      "The suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came initially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had editedThe Philosophy of William James(119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former student of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James volume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar collection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the volume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was interested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than $250 (Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926). Cerf told him to go ahead, then wrote three months later to cancel the project, noting that he wanted the book but was afraid that Scribner’s would not give the necessary permissions (Cerf to Kallen, 29 November 1926; Cerf to Kallen, 3 March 1927). That summer Cerf indicated to Joseph Ratner, who had written on Santayana’s behalf to inquire about progress on the project, that the collection was out of the question for the time being because of the large number of permissions that would have to be secured from Scribner’s. “We are convinced that just as soon as we approached them on the subject they would turn us down and proceed on such an anthology on their own . . .” (Ratner to Cerf, 8 June 1927; Cerf to Ratner, 11 August 1927). Scribner’s publishedThe Philosophy of Santayanain 1939.",
      "The ML edition sold 7,405 copies by 1 November 1943. Scribner’s published a new and greatly enlarged edition ofThe Philosophy of Santayanain 1953 and may have terminated the ML’s reprint contract in anticipation of the appearance of that edition.",

      "Edman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for his work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000 words that would include discussions of the three individual works. When it arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind of introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the Modern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).",
      "Cerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of Boetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of Chicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical Library was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new one (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).",
      "J. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland, noted thatReligio Mediciwas on the Index and warned that its inclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised using a different translation ofThe Imitation of Christ. “If you could use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a Protestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this would make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio Medici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November 1942).",
      "Eckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his opinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the fact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough literate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point of view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral viewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers.

      "Cerf wrote in his foreword:",
      "The compilation of a volume of Great Modern Stories for the Modern Library was originally entrusted to the late Grant Overton in 1930. This amiable gentleman brought around his list in due course, but was far too good-natured and too gentle to hold out against the demands of Donald Klopfer and myself. The eleven stories that were finally included represented our own idea of a happy compromise: two of them were Overton’s choice and nine of them were ours. Now Grant’s remaining two have been scrapped, along with two of our own, and five new ones substituted. I wish that Grant were here to forgive me. He would say again, I know, “It’s your Library, boys; you know what you want to put into it!”",
      "Of the twelve stories in this new edition, my favorite four are “Heart of Darkness,” “The Apple-Tree,” “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” and “The Red Pony,” but the other eight are not far behind them.

      "The ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary fromThe Complete Works of Shakespeare, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904), and its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20 vols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and Oxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its text publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text, Commins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the request that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to William T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).",
      "At least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In theNew Republic, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very agreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be congratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an omission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right to know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who has done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer, “Editions of Shakespeare,”New Republic, 10 January 1944, p. 57).",
      "The drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated graphically only by the color of the lettering (green for theTragedies, red for theComedies, blue for theHistories and Poems). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis Miller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the original jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the second printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25 August 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the proof stage:",
      "The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.",
      "Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets, so that while they are held together by a common thread of recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in other colors.",
      "I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam Goldwyn, and give me what I want.",
      "The length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML to keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World War. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the fall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by different jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the only printings during the war.",
      "The war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but it took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from wartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be three or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted because of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to Mr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation, which made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95 cents and break even, was an additional complication.",

It will be years until we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the meantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume sets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The printing order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21 May 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July.",
      "Each volume was sold individually. An unfortunate result of splitting the Shakespeare volumes was that the notes and glossary were in the second volume of each two-volume set.",

      "As philosopher and man, Henri Bergson is one of the most esteemed intellectual figures of the twentieth century. His major work,Creative Evolution, embodies his chief contribution to the study of reality as life and change. Influential among philosophers and popular among general readers because of its persuasive argument and vivid illustrations, this book has achieved permanence in the literature of philosophical speculation. It takes an honored place in the Modern Library series as a work of enduring vitality and ever–renewing meaning to succeeding generations of thoughtful readers. (Spring 1944)",

      "The ML paid Holt a $750 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Cerf first approached Holt he noted, “I have never read Bergson’s CREATIVE EVOLUTION. I am taking Irwin Edman’s word on this one” (Cerf to William Sloan, Holt, 15 March 1943). He offered an advance of $1,000 on the assumption that the ML would be able to print from Holt plates, but Sloan discovered that the plates had been melted as part of the war effort. Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with the plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that composition and plates would cost at least $500 and suggested reducing the advance from $1,000 to $750, to which Cerf agreed. Edman received $250 for the Foreword (Commins to Edman, 2 December 1943).",

      "Watkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’sAnthology of American Negro Literature(1929) included short stories, selections from novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and autobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories, essays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection represents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s Negro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the Negro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind about his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp. xi–xii).",
      "For poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have been published in this field:Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro Poetry for Young Readers, by Arna Bontemps;Book of American Negro Poetry, by James Weldon Johnson;Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse by Negro Poets, by Countee Cullen;Negro Voices, An Anthology of Contemporary Verse, by Beatrice M. Murphy;Negro Poets and Their Poems, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from novels he recommends “that the following novels be read:Their Eyes Were Watching God, by Zora N. Hurston;Home to Harlem, by Claude McKay;The Blacker the Berry, by Wallace Thurman;My Lives and How I Lost Them, by Countee Cullen;These Low Grounds, by W. E. Turpin;Blood on the Forge, by William Attaway;Black Thunder, by Arna Bontemps;Native Son, by Richard Wright, andThe White Face, by Carl R. Offord” (p. xiii).",
      "Keneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably toThe Negro Caravan, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee (Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes thatThe Negro Caravanhas been highly influential in establishing a canon of African-American literature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that endures. He does not believe the same is true for theAnthology of American Negro Literature(1944). (Kinnamon, 1997)",

Whether we scoff or believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling fascination.",

Included are such shiveringly famous tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home, Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human imagination.",

This summer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume. The first step in this process, duly recognized by the International Order of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb through all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of numerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library archives” (“Trade Winds,”SRL, 28 August 1943, p. 17).",
      "Eleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the anthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a flat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4 cents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy.",

The original plates were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November 1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii).",

      "Cerf initially expressed interest in adding a concise history of the United States to the ML in 1940. He wrote to Frank Monaghan, an assistant professor of history at Yale:",
      "I am crazy to have a clear, concise and up-to-the-minute history of the United States in our Modern Library and wonder if you would be interested in discussing with me the possibility of either writing the book yourself or at least collaborating on such a project.",
      "You will be amazed to hear that there is no such book on the market. Thousands of refugees are clamoring for a short history of the country, written without bias and not as a textbook, priced within their reach. In addition, many thousands of native born Americans are more interested in their country today than has ever been the case before (Cerf to Monaghan, 30 October 1940).",
      "Monaghan was interested and described the book he envisioned: “It should have the epic sweep and the implications of Beethoven and Wagner, the salt and twang of a Woody Guthrie ballad. . . . It should be better than Green’sShort History of the English People” (Monaghan to Cerf, 24 November 1940). The contract, signed in February 1941, called for the manuscript to be delivered by 1 July 1942. The book was to be published initially as a Random House trade book followed by a ML edition. The contract called for payment of up to $1,500 in expenses; Monaghan would receive royalties for the trade edition at the standard sliding scale of 10% of the list price for the first 2,500 copies, 12½% for the next 2,500 copies, and 15% thereafter. Royalties for the ML edition would be 10 cents a copy.",
      "Cerf reported in May 1941 that the announcement of Monaghan’s book “caused more enthusiasm than any publicity release that was ever sent out from this office” (Cerf to Monaghan, 1 May 1941). In September Monaghan indicated that the book was half written (Monaghan to Cerf, 22 September 1941). Monaghan received an additional advance of $500 in September 1942, but he had many other ongoing projects and the book was never completed.",
      "Cerf’s last letter to Monaghan was dated 2 September 1943:",
      "At the time we discussed the project I remember begging you not to take it on unless you were absolutely sure you could deliver. I impressed upon you the fact that if you couldn’t do the book in time, we would attempt to find somebody else who would.",
      "Obviously I made a colossal mistake in judgment when I entrusted this book to you. Had you turned out nothing else since the time you signed the contract, I could have understood your failure to live up to your promise, but I have seen not only your work on Old New York, but that lengthy manuscript on the History of the World that you brought us yourself and that was obviously done on the time that you should have spent finishing the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.",
      "It seems to me that the least that you could have done was to tell us that you couldn’t do the job as soon as you decided on taking up your other work, thus giving us the opportunity of finding somebody else to do what we wanted before other publishers beat us to the draw.",
      "I simply cannot understand dealings of this sort (Cerf to Monaghan, 2 September 1943).",
      "Shortly before Cerf wrote his final letter to Monaghan, Klopfer, who was serving in the U.S. Air Force, wrote to Cerf suggesting “a small illustrated book of the documents of democracy and our own history.” He noted that either Allan Nevins or Henry Steele Commager would do a fine job editing the volume (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, in Cerf and Klopfer,Dear Donald, Dear Bennett, p. 87).",
      "The following month Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of Nevins and Commager’s history, titledAmerica: The Story of a Free Peoplein its original edition andThe Pocket History of the United Statesin the paperback reprint (Pocket Books, February 1943). Cerf referred to it inSaturday Review of Literatureas “the best short ‘History of the United States’ on the market” and noted that the Pocket Books edition had sold half a million copies (“Trade Winds,”SRL, 14 August 1943, p. 14).",
      "Cerf offered Little, Brown a $2,500 advance for a ML edition, but Alfred McIntyre, the president of Little, Brown, indicated that it was selling too well for a ML edition to be considered. In any case, he added, Pocket Books controlled all rights to editions selling for less than two dollars (Cerf to McIntyre, Little, Brown & Co., 17 September 1943; McIntyre to Cerf, 20 September 1943). Cerf’s next step was to offer Pocket Books a $4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised to do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to Commager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months for everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an introduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer indicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and royalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962).",

It omitted Robert Easton’s “To Find a Place” (ML ed., pp. 331–61) but the content of the two editions was otherwise identical. The composition and manufacturing costs for each set of plates was split equally between Pocket Books and the ML. Maule, a RH editor, received a $250 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy on the ML edition.",
      "Hal Borland’s review of the ML edition in theNew York Times Book Reviewnoted the absence of Will James, Andy Adams, and B. M. Bower. Maule had tried to get something by James but the estate was tied up with legal problems and had been unable to grant permission. Adams and Bower wrote no short stories and Maule did not want to include selections from novels. In a letter to Borland he noted, “There is another omission which we are correcting because the Modern Library feels that the permanence of the volume justifies the trouble and expense. Through a mix-up I failed to include a WOLFVILLE story by Alfred Henry Lewis but I am in touch with the estate now, and the next printing will have one” (Maule to Borland, 3 July 1945).",
      "No story by Lewis was ever included. The inflation that followed the Second World War together with relatively slow sales of Maule’s anthology may have ruled out incurring additional costs for permissions, typesetting, and plate making.",

      "Howard Fast stands foremost among the younger generation of writers in America. His historical novels of the critical first years of the Republic have been notable for their insight and dramatic impact; their heroes are motivated by a deep but simple humanity, and their dedication to man’s struggle for liberty has made his books unique contributions to an understanding of the forces and personalities that shaped our nation.

      "Charles Duell suggested a ML edition of Fast’sConceived in Libertyin 1942.

The reprint contract was signed two-and-a-half years later, in May 1945.",
      "Four years afterThe Unvanquishedwas added to the ML, Fast contacted Cerf about a rumor that the novel and his volume devoted to Tom Paine in ML Giants (G69) were being dropped from the series. Fast had joined the Communist Party in 1944 and in recent testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities had refused to reveal the names of contributors to a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War (“Howard Fast,”Wikipedia, accessed 27 July 2010). He wrote:",
      "I do hope I am needlessly perturbed, but I thought it best to write you and ask whether the rumor that my books have been dropped from the Modern Library has any basis in fact. It came to me from several places in the industry that you were cleaning people like myself out of the Modern Library, and that two of the initial adjustments were THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE.",
      "I don’t have to tell you that I find this most difficult to believe. Whatever our political differences have been—and they have been very considerable—I always considered you a person of independence and integrity. I cannot believe that any circumstances would cause you to give aid and comfort to the unspeakable group of people who both fear and hate books, and attack them. (Fast to Cerf, 7 December 1949).",
      "Cerf replied:",
      "The rumor you quote in your letter of December 7th to the effect that your books were going to be dropped from the Modern Library because “we were cleaning people like yourself out of the series” is 100% incorrect. I would be interested in learning where you heard this rumor. . . .",
      "Your THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE were added to the Modern Library because we believed they belonged there. Any opinions that we may have of your political ideas, or you personally, do not alter those beliefs in any degree whatsoever. The only thing that will ever make us drop either or both of these books from the series is a drop-off in general sales so marked as to make their retention no longer desirable from a commercial point of view (Cerf to Fast, 9 December 1949).",
      "The Unvanquishedwas dropped from the ML in fall 1952, presumably because of poor sales.The Selected Work of Tom Paine, edited by Fast, coupled with Fast’s novelCitizen Tom Paine(G69), remained in ML Giants until 1970.",

      "James D. Hart, the author of the Foreword, had suggested a ML edition ofTwo Years before the Mastin 1935 and indicated that it would have a steady sale to schools and colleges (Hart to Cerf, 19 February 1935). Later that year Cerf offered Hart $75 to write an introduction to the Grabhorn Press edition with the understanding that the introduction could also be used in due course in a ML edition (Cerf to Hart, 12 November 1935). Hart also advised Edwin and Robert Grabhorn about the best edition to use as a copy-text when setting their edition.",
      "Hart stated in his introduction to the Grabhorn edition, “The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life, and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote ‘twenty-four years after.’ To this have been added the concluding chapter of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p. [xiv]). The second sentence is altered in ML ed. as follows: “To this have been added the preface and epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p. [xiv]). The preface appears in both the Grabhorn and ML editions; the epilogue (titled “Concluding Memorandum” in the Grabhorn edition) appears on pp. 413–23 of the ML edition as part of “Twenty-four Years After.” The concluding chapter referred to in Hart’s introduction to the Grabhorn edition is omitted from 381a. The ML edition also omitted the penultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding chapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided incorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the events as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I shall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have been suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4).",

      "Cerf authorized Commins to prepare a volume of Irving’s writings for the ML in August 1944. Commins was to provide an introduction, and the length of the book was to be no more than 700 pages. Commins submitted a preliminary table of contents about seven weeks later, noting that he proposed to include Irving’s burlesqueHistory of New Yorkby Diedrich Knickerbocker in complete form. “First, it’s the best thing he wrote and his greatest fame rests on it. Second, and very important, it is a wonderful selling point to be able to say that we give the History complete and unabridged. . . . The History is hard to get outside conventional sets of Irving.” Commins received a $250 advance against royalties of 3 cents for every copy sold in the ML (Cerf to Commins, 17 August 1944, Commins to Cerf, 5 October 1944; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library).",

When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I think it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do well with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12 January 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for fall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on the grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our relations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam, Macmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML edition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).",

      "Of the new generation of novelists, risen to prominence during the Second World War, no one stands higher than John Hersey. InA Bell for Adanohe has given the first fictional, and so far the most eloquent, American interpretation of the struggle of democracy against fascism. He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world. (Spring 1946)",

      "The ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a copy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A Pocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.",
      "Hersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in place of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar rather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:",
      "For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began: “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”",
      "On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two things.",
      "One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .",
      "The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men, when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones, when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).",
      "Commins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever to appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November 1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in the Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not “consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere else” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf edition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint editions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more than thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.",
      "Copies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of the volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and jacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author stamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and title printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is indicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used on ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as regular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for the use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.",

      "For many years the editors of the Modern Library have tried to acquire the rights of publication of the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Now, by special arrangement with the Estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, complete and unabridged in one volume and comprising twenty-three of the greatest tales to come from the pen of the master, is offered as the classic in its field. Here for your mystification and delight are “The Red-Headed League,” “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” “The Five Orange Pips” and others of equal fame and favor. (Spring 1946)",

      "Cerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about includingThe Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmesin the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and make new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a way of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 April 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred Cerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle Estate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being difficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a period of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible limitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes stories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).",
      "Klopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with Watt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped its proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a three-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt to drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML would be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is included in Cerf and Klopfer,Dear Donald, Dear Bennett, pp. 195–98). He also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was considering puttingThe Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmesinto the Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that, although the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years and he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at ten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed to a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five years.",
      "Vincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the ML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I would rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of the American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty corrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was published without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a first printing of 10,000 copies.",

McIntyre, Little, Brown, 1 October 1943). At that time Little, Brown did not want to authorize another reprint edition of Nash’s poems. Garden City Publishing Co. was doing well with its one-dollar reprint ofThe Face Is Familiar: The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash, andThe Ogden NashPocket Bookwas scheduled to appear as a 25-cent paperback early the following year (McIntyre to Cerf, 2 October 1943).

We regret to report, however, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so.

      "In response to an ever-increasing number of written suggestions that there be a larger representation of the novels of Balzac in the Modern Library, the editors have chosen for inclusion in the series two of his most famous works of fiction:Père GoriotandEugénie Grandet. In brand-new translations, the first by E. K. Brown of Chicago University, and the second by Dorothea Walter and John Watkins, this portion of the massive structure of the Human Comedy belongs among the world’s greatest novels of creative imagination and social criticism.

      "E. K. Brown of Cornell University suggested that the ML needed a volume of Balzac in addition toDroll Stories(221), which he considered unrepresentative. “You have Stendhal, Flaubert and Maupassant, why not Balzac?” (Brown to Cerf, 26 March 1943). Cerf commissioned him to modernize existing English translations ofPère GoriotandEugénie Grandetand to write an introduction. Brown agreed to a fee of $300 and promised the manuscript within five months (Cerf to Brown, 25 August 1943). Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the Balzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the library which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four months later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were needed (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the existing translations were probably very bad and favored doing new translations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we pay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to advertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February 1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should tell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this point Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown, 10 February 1944).",
      "Brown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed work on the translation ofEugénie Grandet. In December he suggested John Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4 December 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent $300 each to Brown and Watkins. The financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and Brown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that $500 would be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he initially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being unreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually accepted the $300 fee.",

Brown inserted three paragraphs of biographical information after the opening paragraph of the introduction. The additions to the introduction extended its length by a page, and the bibliography occupied an additional two pages. By using the blank page that followed the introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96 occupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to incorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length of the volume.

      "For more than a quarter of a century Robert Frost has maintained a position of unrivaled honor among living American poets. Associated generally with New England, his works have transcended sectional limitations and have become the lyrical voice of the entire land. Not only has Robert Frost chosen 230 of his 270 published poems [±230 of his poems for this collection], but he also contributes a personal credo in the form of an Introductory Essay, “The Constant Symbol,” and a new sonnet written especially for this volume.

      "Cerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in 1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later Robert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the year, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated that the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid for and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write an introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944). It took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the delay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan conveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include every poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of Frost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and Pocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945).The Pocket Book of Robert Frost’s Poemswas published in 1946 andThe Complete Poems of Robert Frost(Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern Library contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500 advance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract was for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless terminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.",
      "Linscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems inThe Collected Poems of Robert Frost(Holt, 1939) andA Witness Tree(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott to Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided that he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four of the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had left out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to Mr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by way of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but instead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13 December 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four poems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The Mountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter Night,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue Ribbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking with Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the contents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only “The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection. Linscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages (Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The Constant Symbol,” was also published inAtlantic Monthly(October 1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost appended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.",

He also didn’t like the idea of printing the two works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to seeThe Sound and the FuryandLight in Augustreprinted separately. He continued:",
      "Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I don’t think that’s such a good idea either. [In its list for fall and winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited edition ofThe Sound and the Fury with the text in three colors and a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.] But for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix? (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946).",
      "Cowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley that the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to write an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945 The Compsons” that Faulkner had written forThe Portable Faulkner. Cowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing permission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on:",
      "Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,” having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel. His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow— either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer, because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or else hijack a copy from some friend.",
      "I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack [sic], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business [see G68]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux, perhaps, now writing in any language. . . .",
      "I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels. I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too, under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an end paper [paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as a frontispiece]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and shows any sign of selling, and if Viking is sure of an unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and then the way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry.",
      "I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book [The Portable Faulkner]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 [i.e., 1946]; underlining in original).",
      "Linscott replied:",
      "I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . .",
      "I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back.",
      "Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more likely to want to read the other.",
      "On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott to Cowley, 15 February 1946).",
      "In the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The ML printed his Appendix fromThe Portable Faulknerwith minor revisions, placing it at the beginning ofThe Sound and the Fury, referring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by the author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was superseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition ofThe Sound and the Fury(593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume (pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four novels (Soldiers’ Pay,Mosquitoes,Flags in the Dust, andThe Sound and the Fury), published in 2006, also prints the appendix “Compson: 1699–1945” at the end ofThe Sound and the Fury(pp. 1127–41).",
      "The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dyingsold 10,640 copies during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh best-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML.

      "The ML paid Perelman royalties of 10 cents a copy, double the rate specified for a ML reprint in the Random House contract (Perelman to Cerf, 22 September 1946). Perelman wrote a new introduction for the ML edition under the name “Sidney Namlerep” and sent four additional pieces: “Physician, Steel Thyself,” “Pale Hands I Loathe,” “Insert Flap ‘A’ and Throw Away,” and “Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer.” He hoped that the additional pieces could be inserted within the text rather than added at the end but recognized that that might not be possible sinceCrazy Like a Foxplates were being used. He also asked to change the dedication from “For Laura and Abby Laura” (his wife and daughter) to “To Robert C. Benchley” (Perelman to Klopfer, 2 December 1946). The dedication in the Random House edition was printed on the verso of the title page; the dedication to Benchley in the Modern Library edition appeared on a leaf of its own.",
      "Perelman suggested McKnight Kauffer as the jacket designer for the ML edition. Five years earlier, after meeting with Saxe Commins in connection with his forthcoming bookThe Dream Department(Random House, 1943), he commented, “On the way out after leaving you, I looked at some of McKnight Kauffer’s jackets for Modern Library titles. He’s wonderful; I really would love to have him do a jacket for the book if it could be arranged” (Perelman to Commins, “Tuesday” [6 October 1942]). Kauffer designed the jackets forThe Dream Departmentand the Random House trade edition ofCrazy Like a Foxas well as the jacket for the ML edition.",
      "Perelman also emphasized that it was important to proofreadCrazy Like a Foxcarefully, and he asked for several changes in the text, of which the most notable was changing “total recall” to “O’Hara’s disease” (p. 53). Other changes included changing “rif ling” to “riffling” (p. 47), “jack boots” to “jackboots” (p. 88), and “compound fracture” to “greenstick fracture” (p. 184).",
      "Negotiations concerning the publication ofThe Best of S. J. Perelmanbetween Cerf and Perelman’s agent, Alan Collins of Curtis Brown, Ltd., were not harmonious. Prior to publication Cerf wrote Collins: “I would like to state here very clearly that we will carry out our contract for the Perelman anthology in the Modern Library and that, thereafter, we have not the faintest interest in future writings by Mr. Perelman” (Cerf to Collins, 18 November 1946).",
      "Random House published five books by Perelman between 1937 and 1946. His next book was published by Reynal & Hitchcock; thereafter he settled into a long-term publishing relationship with Simon & Schuster."

      "McKeon edited theBasic Works of Aristotlewithout a contract and was unhappy with the financial arrangements he was offered when it was completed. He had undertaken the collection hoping that it could be published as a ML Giant and was prepared to accept a flat fee of $500 if it was published in an inexpensive format suitable for classroom use. “I made it abundantly clear, in conversation,” he wrote later, “that in the event that a larger price was to be charged for the volume, I would consent to do it only on the basis of a continuing royalty payment” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). He was informed after he submitted the manuscript that it could not be published as a Giant, and Cerf rejected the royalty rate he suggested (5 percent on the first 3,500 copies rising to 12½ percent on sales over 10,000 copies). McKeon eventually agreed to an arrangement that limited his earnings to $1,250 (McKeon to Commins, ibid.).",
      "When Cerf invited him to compile a shorter collection of Aristotle’s writings for the ML, McKeon insisted on a contract before beginning work. He wrote Cerf, “If you had asked me to do the small Aristotle before the months of battling with Saxe [Commins] about the larger Aristotle, I should probably have told you it couldn’t be done. After that experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me, therefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the only thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would seem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more concretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you propose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold annual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945). The terms of the contract have not been ascertained, but McKeon described the royalty he received on sales ofIntroduction to Aristotleas “meager” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947).",
      "Introduction to Aristotleestablished itself as a textbook and became one of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period from November 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,114 copies, making it the ML’s third best-selling title and one of eight titles (including Giants) with annual sales exceeding 10,000 copies.",
      "When the ML edition was declared out of print McKeon sought a reversion of rights so thatIntroduction to Aristotlecould be published by the University of Chicago Press. Random House agreed to his request, overlooking the fact that the collection was still in print in the paperbound series Modern Library College Editions. Klopfer admitted, “Nobody thought of the Modern Library College Edition until we had committed ourselves. . . . There wouldn’t have been a chance of reverting any rights to you if we hadn’t overlooked the MLCE” (Klopfer to Morris Philipson, University of Chicago Press, 2 October 1972). The reversion was limited to hardcover rights.",
      "The University of Chicago Press published its edition ofIntroduction to Aristotlein 1973. Described as a “second edition, revised and enlarged,” it included a new general introduction and new introductions to each work. In addition to the contents of the ML edition, it includedDe Partibus Animalium(On the Parts of Animals), Book I, Chapter 1, andRhetorica(Rhetoric), Book I, Chapters 1–4 and Book II, Chapters 18–22. The format was 3/16 inch taller than the 7½ inch format the ML was then using.

Ten years after the ML edition was published Linscott suggested the addition of a frontispiece map with the place names Herodotus used in italics and their modern equivalents in roman type. He thought that modern readers couldn’t follow the narrative without such a map (Linscott to Cerf, 15 September 1957). The map does not appear to have been added.",

      "Pegis states in the Preface: “The present volume represents selections of materials, drawn entirely fromBasic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, which Random House published in 1945. . . . I have not made my selections with an eye to the opinions of specialists; I have aimed at meeting what seemed to me the needs of the college student who is a beginner in St. Thomas. Such a student will find in this book St. Thomas’ mature views of the most crucial questions of natural theology, psychology, theory of knowledge and ethics” (p. vii).",
      "Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinaswas widely adopted in Catholic colleges as a textbook for philosophy courses, and it became one of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,129 copies, making it the second best-selling title in the series and one of five ML titles with annual sales exceeding 10,000 copies. Maugham,Of Human Bondage(199) outsold Aquinas by 434 copies;Introduction to Aristotle(396) trailed Aquinas by fifteen copies. Pegis later indicated thatIntroduction to St. Thomas Aquinasconsistently sold 15,000–18,000 copies a year and had become “unexpectedly a textbook. . . . No one planned it this way, and certainly no one anticipated such an unusual eventuality. But, what is worse, theIntroductionis an improperly organized textbook since it was never edited with such a teaching purpose in view; it was simply organized as a representative collection of Thomistic readings fromBasic Writings. As a textbook, theIntroductionneeds a wider range of selections, introductions in the fields of instruction involved, notes, bibliographies and both subject and author indices” (Pegis to Klopfer, 21 June 1963).",
      "Pegis suggested a revised edition prepared specifically for the textbook market as early as 1951. Part of his concern seems to have been to secure better financial terms for himself, but no one at Random House wanted to take such a successful title out of the ML (Klopfer to Pegis, 5 December 1951). Pegis was still talking about a textbook edition in 1963. At that time he noted that the market would be expanding sharply as the baby boom generation entered Catholic colleges and proposed turningIntroduction to Aquinasinto a textbook selling at five or six dollars with a normal royalty of 10 to 15 percent of the list price. He also offered to prepare a shorter and more general volume titledThe Aquinas Papersto replaceIntroduction to Aquinasin the ML (Pegis to Klopfer, 21 June 1963).",
      "Epstein saw no point in scrapping the ML’s plates forIntroduction to Aquinas(Epstein memo to Klopfer, 14 August 1963). Pegis then suggested raising the list price from $1.95 to $2.45 and increasing his royalty to 10 percent (Pegis to Klopfer, 27 August 1963). Epstein countered with an offer of a 5 percent royalty based on a list price of $2.45—the retail price of ML books was in the process of increasing to $2.45 in any case—and Pegis accepted (Pegis to Klopfer, 10 October 1963)."

Unfortunately the novel is often confused with its popular dramatization, which toured the United States for some years, reaching many people who had never read the book, and which relied on a kind of melodrama and simplification of character totally alien to the original. Thus “Uncle Tom” has become a term of opprobrium for a subservient black, whereas Uncle Tom in the novel is a man who, under the most inhumane of circumstances, never loses his human dignity.",

Interestingly enough, although it first appeared in an abolitionist paper,The National Era, it was not intended as either propaganda or an attack on the South. Indeed, it presented some of the favorable aspects of slavery while crystallizing the sentiments of the abolitionist North. It is notable, for example, that the cruel slave owner, Simon Legree, is a New Englander, while the kindly, good-tempered St. Clare is a Kentuckyan.",

      "For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought to include in the series a comprehensive volume of Emily Dickinson’s poetry. Now, through the co-operation of her original publishers, we are able to offer the passionate and mystical verses of one of the most original and appealing poets in the entire history of American letters. The romantic circumstances under which Emily Dickinson became a hermit and guarded her poems against publication during her lifetime are now a legend; her poems themselves are the real and lasting expression of her incomparable intensity and delicacy. (Fall 1948)",
      "Original ML collection. Published fall 1948.WR23 October 1948. First printing: Not ascertained.",
      "Cerf first expressed interest in a ML edition of Dickinson’s poetry in 1937, offering Little, Brown a $1,500 advance against royalties. At that time all of Dickinson’s poems were protected by copyright, and Little, Brown rejected the offer. Alfred R. McIntyre, the firm’s president, wrote: “You have made a good offer, but it does not change our views. This is a very valuable property and we are afraid that, though our sales might not fall off tremendously, they would fall off enough so that we should not gain by the transaction.” He noted that Little, Brown’s share of the advance would be $750 (the other half would go to the Dickinson estate) and that if it took five years for sales of the ML edition to cover the advance, Little, Brown’s income would only be $150 a year—and that a very small decline in sales would erase the firm’s profit (McIntyre to Cerf, 26 May 1937).",
      "By 1948, when the ML was able to negotiate reprint rights, Little, Brown’s situation had changed but the ML was still unable to get everything it wanted.Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson, published in the ML in October 1948, consisted of Dickinson’sPoems(1890),Poems: Second Series(1891), and a selection fromPoems: Third Series(1896). The three books, originally published by Roberts Brothers, had been published by Little, Brown & Co. since 1898, when it absorbed Roberts Brothers.",
      "The first two volumes entered the public domain in 1946 and 1947, and the third would enter the public domain in 1952. The ML had hoped to base its edition on Dickinson’sPoems: Centenary Edition(Little, Brown, 1930), which included poems from two subsequent volumes. Little, Brown flatly refused to allow the ML to base its selection on the Centenary Edition. The ML wanted a more comprehensive collection than the poems already in the public domain since World Publishing Co. was bringing out a volume of Dickinson’s public domain poems in their Living Library series. Little, Brown finally gave the ML permission to include poems from the first three volumes provided not more than a third of the total came fromPoems: Third Series(Linscott to Conrad Aiken, 31 March 1948 and 5 April 1948). This stipulation required the omission of twenty-one poems fromPoems: Third Series.",
      "Aiken had repeatedly urged the ML to reprint hisSelected Poems of Emily Dickinson(London: Jonathan Cape, 1924). When the arrangements with Little, Brown were made Linscott wrote him, “Since this looks like a very simple editorial job, Bennett has suggested that I make the selection. It seemed to me that we might be able to use the Introduction you did for the English edition (or perhaps a revised version) on payment of a comparatively small fee. The reason for this parsimony is that we have to pay a heavy royalty to Little Brown which leaves us little or no editorial margin” (Linscott to Aiken, 31 March 1948).",
      "Aiken, who had clashed with the ML three years earlier over the removal of poems by Ezra Pound fromAn Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry(G68), which he edited with William Rose Benét, responded:",
      "“What’s this, another Trojan Horse? another case of “dona ferentes”, as when Saxe [Commins] told me of the marvelously easy way I could make $250 without a stroke of work, all by just letting him use my comprehensive anthology with Bill Benet’s book to make a Giant—and little aiken [sic] to get no royalty, while the Giant proceeded to blanket the sales of the Modern Library edition???? As I’ve written Bernice [Baumgarten, Aiken’s agent], for fifteen years or longer I’ve repeatedly been urging the use of my Selected ED in the Modern Library, and this little manoeouvre [sic] doesn’t, from where I’m sitting, look either pretty or generous—nor very much like the magnanimity one expects from an old friend (Aiken to Linscott, 2 April 1948; underlining in original).",
      "Linscott replied that little editing was involved since the ML wanted to use as many poems as possible and only a handful of poems had be omitted from the third volume (Linscott to Aiken, 5 April 1948).",
      "There were significant differences between the ML volume and Aiken’s 1924 anthology. The ML edition presents 426 of Dickinson’s poems in four sequences (“Life,” “Nature,” “Love,” and “Time and Eternity”). Aiken’s anthology included 220 poems with each poem printed on a separate page. The ML numbered the poems within each sequence. Aiken had given them titles.",
      "The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 6 cents a copy. Aiken was pacified with a payment of $1,000 for the use of his introduction toSelected Poems of Emily Dickinson(London: Jonathan Cape, 1924), which he revised for the ML. The revisions included correcting his reference in the first paragraph to T. W. Higginson as “editor of theAtlantic Monthlyat that time” (Cape edition, pp. 5–6) to “essayist and contributor to theAtlantic Monthly” (ML edition, p. vii–viii).",
      "Sales through spring 1958 totaled 36,631 copies; annual sales for the three-year period May 1955–April 1958 showed steady growth as follows: 4,066 (1955–56), 5,141 (1956–57), and 5,246 (1957–58). Bonnell and Bonnell (p. 112) report a seventeenth printing of 7,000 copies in 1963 and seven printings “since then” totaling 25,500 copies.",
      "Selected Poems of Emily Dickinsonhas remained one of the most readily available editions of Dickinson’s poetry for most of the period since its publication. It survived the 1970s, when Random House slashed hundreds of titles from the Modern Library, and remained in print into the 1980s. The contents, based on the copyright status of Dickinson’s poems in 1948, remained unchanged throughout this period. It was only in 1996, after Random House revived the Modern Library, that the twenty-one poems omitted from the original edition were added. By this time they had been in the public domain for forty-four years. The only other differences between the content of the original ML edition and the reset 1996 version were the replacement of Aiken’s introduction with an unsigned biographical note by Billy Collins and the welcome addition of an index of first lines."

Cerf believed that the imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked Sheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen did not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would affect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to contact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949).

      "To bring within the compass of one volume the best of the essays written by Michel de Montaigne in a translation that is both faithful and modern has long been the aim of the editors of this series. The existing English renderings are either so archaic or are sometimes so colloquial as to lose some of the original nuances of meaning. Accordingly, with the William Hazlitt [Charles Cotton–W. C. Hazlitt] translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and modernized collection in language that retains the substance and conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay form. (Fall 1949; [Spring 1956])",
      "Original ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published fall 1949.WR10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.",
      "Montaigne’sEssayshad been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first in the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation, and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947). He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged. The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United States. Because there was some question of British rights, we voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29 September 1947).",
      "Bates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century translation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the public domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the original and to give the best possible modern rendering.”",
      "Bates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt translation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the Editor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised it, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to the accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to modernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the translation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]). Bates did not consider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement “completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of the title page be omitted.",
      "The manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have been delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his editorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.",
      "Bates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included the essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion of sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain in language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one of the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and quotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed. If you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to Commins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in fact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or, if included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).",

      "In 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern Library College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.",
      "Stein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s translation of Montaigne’sComplete Works:Essays, Travel Journal, Letters(Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3 November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion. If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’sComplete Essaysin 1958, may not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.",

      "Based on the old Spanish saga familiar to us through Mozart and Molière,Don Juanis Byron’s acknowledged masterpiece. A sixteen-canto epic satire in ottava rima, it recounts the seductions and betrayals, mishaps and adventures of the rakish Spanish grandee. Byron’s “plan was to have no plan” but to “unpack his heart” in the person of his hero. By his own account he meant to be “quietly facetious about everything,” and he used the epic to satirize English life, customs, manners and morals. But beneath the satiric impulse was a hatred of hypocrisy and a consciousness of the power of illusion. IfChilde Harold, as Louis Kronenberger remarks in his introduction, “is in large part Byronism,Don Juan“is Byron.” Romantic, irreverent, exuberant and entertaining, it is a “hymn to the earth,” but also a human sequence to “its own music chaunted.”",

      "The ML paid Liveright a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. The Liveright plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML had to reset the text and make new plates. The ML’s typesetting was made from a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he indicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March 1949). The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates became the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against royalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed nothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties were due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition passed 30,000 copies. Hackett received $750 from Liveright when the ML edition was published and nothing thereafter.",
      "Arthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930 lived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American publishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of his own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the $2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that the ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random House he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in December 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies, leaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20. The ML had paid nothing to Liveright since the initial advance in 1949 (Hiram Haydn to Hackett, 22 December 1958)."

      "Friedrich received a $750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy. At first he planned to include selections fromCritique of Pure Reasonbut wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly as I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very unsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure Reason.” He suggested omittingCritique of Pure Reasonaltogether and including fuller extracts from theProlegomena(Friedrich to Commins, 14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page selection from the Introduction toCritique of Pure Reasonwas included. The ML published an abridged edition ofCritique of Pure Reasonin 1958 (506).",
      "Friedrich wrote Commins that he thought thatThe Philosophy of Kantwas a misleading title since large parts of theCritiquewere not included. He suggested calling the bookIntroduction to KantorKant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy(Friedrich to Commins, 20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had already been announced. He argued thatThe Philosophy of Kantdid not misrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but he offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to Friedrich, 25 July 1949).",

      "“The tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains” undertaken by Francis Parkman in 1846 became a journey of research and brought forth, three years later, one of the permanent historical records of American expansion. At first hand Parkman gathered from Sioux Indians, hunters and trappers the material which was to makeThe Oregon Trailas much a tale of adventure as an authentic chronicle of the frontier. Exactly a century after its first publication, it takes its place in the Modern Library series, introduced by a distinguished contemporary historian, Henry Steele Commager. (Fall 1949)",

He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page drawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of the chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were to be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21 January 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for bothThe Oregon Trailand Alcott’sLittle Women, the other Illustrated Modern Library title announced for fall 1947.",
      "At this point the type forThe Oregon Trailwas in galleys and the plates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publishThe Oregon Trailwithout illustrations in the regular ML.Little Women(431) was added to the regular series the following year.",
      "The jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss made for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the introduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote him about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume was at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29 June 1949)."

In his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in detective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the growth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely imitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection was available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has excelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that the hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and distinct form” (p. xii).",

The ability to interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche has opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the world of dreams, Sigmund Freud has created a transformation in our generation’s thinking.The Interpretation of Dreamsis here offered, complete and unabridged, in the translation by Dr. A. A.

      "Issued on the one hundredth anniversary of William Wordsworth’s death, this volume is both commemorative and representative. It bears testimony to the continuing vitality of one of the greatest of England’s imaginative, romantic poets. In its more than 700 pages are to be found all that the modern reader can demand. Here included are the “Descriptive Sketches,” “Lyrical Ballads,” tales, sonnets, odes, pastorals, “The Prelude,” “Ecclesiastical Sonnets” and a wide selection of long and short miscellaneous verse. Mark Van Doren, poet, essayist and teacher, has made a generous yet discriminating selection from the vast body of writing achieved by Wordsworth during the almost fifty years he devoted to poetry. Mr. Van Doren’s Introduction is an illuminating critical interpretation of the poet and his work. (Spring 1950)",

In its original form, it was the novel by which Henry James won world-wide recognition in his early maturity. As a play, under the titleThe Heiress, its glowing story held thousands of theatre-goers under its spell. Finally, as a motion picture, under its new title, the novel once again gave evidence of its vitality and popularity to a new mass audience. NowWashington Squaretakes an honored place in the Modern Library with three other famous works by Henry James:The Turn of the Screw, No. 169,The Wings of the Dove, No. 244, andThe Portrait of a Lady, No. 107. Clifton Fadiman contributes an illuminating and perceptive Introduction for this distinguished addition to the series. (Spring 1950)",

      "Random House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith and Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML wasSanctuary(233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of Faulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles were added until 1946, whenThe Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying(394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new typesetting. The publication of that volume, together withThe Portable Faulkner, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few months earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a major American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. The Modern Library edition ofLight in August, published four years afterThe Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying, became the third Faulkner volume in the series.",

These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the period 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so.",

      "Louisa May Alcott’s hope thatLittle Womenwould become “the most tattered, dog-eared, best-loved book in the library” has been more than fulfilled through the decades following its publication in 1868. Generation after generation, young people and their elders have read and reread the adventures of the March family, admired Jo’s daring, wept when Beth died and sighed sympathetically over Meg’s and Amy’s romantic adventures. Those who remember their youth and want to renew it keep a special place in their hearts for this nostalgic tale of a vanished time and spirit in American life. (Fall 1950)",

      "Little Womenwith illustrations by Albert de Mee Jousset was originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Jousset received $2,000 for the artwork, which included color illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings ranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on pages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for bothLittle Womenand Parkman’sOregon Trail, the other Illustrated Modern Library title announced for fall 1947.",
      "At this point the type forLittle Womenwas in galleys (the text was set from the edition published in Grosset & Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior Library), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed, and all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publishLittle Womenin the regular ML without color illustrations.The Oregon Trail(423) was also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket ofLittle Womenis unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color illustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library.",
      "The ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second printing in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued."

      "The point of controversy, in 1864, between Charles Kingsley and John Henry Newman is now only incidental to what it produced. Out of it came one of the most influential religious autobiographies of Western literature, theApologia Pro Vita Sua. It is far more than a vigorous defense of religious adherence; it is an affirmation of faith and conviction, a projection of a magnetic and powerful personality and a dynamic account of spiritual conversion. Anton C. Pegis, the renowned Thomist scholar and distinguished Catholic philosopher, provides an illuminating and perceptive introduction for Cardinal Newman’s masterpiece. (Fall 1950)",

      "Cerf initially asked Jacques Maritain, whom Commins had suggested as a long shot, to write an introduction toApologia Pro Vita Sua(Cerf to Maritain, 16 September 1949). Maritain either declined or did not reply. Cerf then turned to Pegis, who had worked with Random House and the ML in the past. At Commins’s request Pegis secured a nihil obstat and imprimatur on his introduction. Commins sent Pegis a copy of the original 1864 edition to mark for composition purposes (Commins to Pegis, 10 April 1950). Pegis initially hoped to include Newman’s corrections from the 1865 edition but decided to use the original text accompanied by the correspondence with Charles Kingsley (pp. 373–90) and Kingsley’s pamphlet,What, Then, Does Dr. Newman Mean?(pp. 391–430)."

In June 1951 Stein indicated that a decision had been made to include the volume in the regular ML as well. “When the contract was originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition . . . we could not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve a part of our investment” (Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1951). Stein sent Briggs an additional payment of $100 in recognition of the publication ofThe Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Keatsin the regular ML.",
      "The volume was printed from offset plates at a time when most ML titles were printed letterpress. Freiman was disappointed with the quality of the printing. When the first set of MLCE sheets arrived he told the ML’s printer that the quality was “very bad. I would not feel so sad about this were it not for the fact that these are printed from a new set of plates. Further, I have been impressed with the fine quality of printing the Rinehart editions enjoy” (Freiman to Richard Simon, Parkway Printing, 10 May 1951). MLCE had been created to compete with Rinehart Editions in the burgeoning college market.",
      "The text of the poems “is substantially that of the first editions. A number of emendations have been made as a result of collating later editions. . . . Some silent changes in punctuation, etc., have been made in the interest of greater clarity. The text of Keats’s letters . . . is reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press from Maurice Buxton Forman’sThe Letters of John Keats” (p. xxxv)."

The story of a man of fabulous daring somewhere on the South American seaboard during the turmoil of a revolution is far more than the recital of astounding feats; it is a drama of large-scale conflicts against a background of a strange land and the vast sea, told with power and insight and the subtle interplay of light and shadow.

Doubleday indicated that two sets of plates were available, one of 631 pages in excellent shape and one of 537 pages in poor condition. Stein recommended thatNostromobe included in the regular ML and that the better plates be used (Stein memo to Haas, 15 August 1950).",
      "AfterNostromoentered the public domain Klopfer inquired if a lower royalty would be appropriate. He was informed that Doubleday continued to receive full royalties on other editions and replied, “As long as everybody else is paying regular royalties certainly I don’t want to alter the terms. It’s just when a book actually gets kicked around in the public domain that we feel a change in arrangements should be made” (Klopfer to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 14 November 1963; Barbara Drysdale, Doubleday, to Klopfer, 6 December 1963; Klopfer to Drysdale, 12 December 1963).",

      "Set in the civil-war-torn Central American Republic of Costaguana,Nostromois “a complex of personal stories,” Robert Penn Warren observes, involving conflicts of heroic proportions and tragic consequences. From the materialist Charles Gould, owner of the Gould Concession of the San Tomé mine, and the traitorous Dr. Monygham, to old Georgio Viola and the sceptic Decoud, each character lives an illusion next to the “natural” man Nostromo and the beneficent Emilia Gould. A novel that reveals the nefarious effects of unbridled greed and imperialist interests,Nostromoupholds Conrad’s belief in fidelity, moral discipline, and the need for human communion. Conrad himself described it as “an intense creative effort on what I suppose will remain my largest canvas,” and it is considered one of his greatest works. It is an exemplary statement of his conviction that “the solidarity of all mankind” rests upon “simple ideas and sincere emotions.”",

      "Originally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted thatFour Famous Greek Plays(178) would have to be completely revised. He told Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the Modern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart Edition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In addition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more specifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we prepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based upon the Lifetime Library [Random House] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK DRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give the College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted thatSeven Famous Greek Playswould differ from the Rinehart anthology in the following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have Euripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally desirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I think for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do not.”",
      "Stein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library edition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he indicated that the use of these translations would depend on the permission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit the ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions that prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the general introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein concluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book available for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of July 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1 February 1950).",
      "Oates received a flat fee of $200 for his general introduction to Greek tragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a flat fee of $100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the introduction toThe Frogs. Permission fees included $100 each for Aldington’s translation ofAlcestisand Murray’s translation ofThe Frogs; More’s translation ofPrometheus Boundappears to have required a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional $100 whenSeven Famous Greek Playswas added to the regular ML (Commins to Oates, 28 June 1951).",

Stein agreed and offered him a flat fee of $250 to select and edit the text and write the introduction, noting that the new edition would assure the ML of “a book considerably more desirable than that offered by any competitors, not only in terms of quantity of material but in terms of the more complete picture it gives of Whitman himself” (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 25 January 1950; 5 April 1950; 10 April 1950).

      "Six Modern American Playswas originally intended for Modern Library College Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and addedlater to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee $150 for selecting the plays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950). Halline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline began by suggesting Anderson’sWinterset, Kaufman and Hart’sThe Man Who Came to Dinner, O’Neill’sMourning Becomes Electra, Robert Sherwood’sThere Shall Be No Night, Philip Barry’sHotel Universe, and Sidney Howard’sYellow Jack. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who rejectedHotel UniverseandYellow Jackand indicated his preferred for O’Neill’sEmperor Jonesand Sherwood’sAbe Lincoln in Illinois.",
      "Stein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’sLittle Foxes. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new dramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’sGlass MenagerieorA Streetcar Named Desire, Arthur Miller’sDeath of a Salesman, or Heggen and Logan’sMister Roberts;his own preference, he indicated, was Williams. Halline approvedThe Emperor Jones,Abe Lincoln in IllinoisandThe Glass Menagerie(Halline to Stein, 28 September 1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup:The Emperor Jones,Winterset,The Man Who Came to Dinner,The Little Foxes,The Glass Menagerie, andAbe Lincoln in Illinois. Sherwood’s play was dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission.Death of a Salesmanwas the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty than the ML was prepared to pay.Mister Robertswas finally selected, in part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid royalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay half a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition.",
      "In the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the introduction only.",
      "Stein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out the anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The costs of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College Edition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find some way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline, 25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951).Six Modern American Playswas added to MLCE in the mid-1960s.",

It traced a new phenomenon in our national life during the years following the Civil War and portrayed the ferocity of the struggle for social recognition and acceptance.

Rejecting the symbolism of Melville and Hawthorne, and the false sentimentality of popular novels, Howells defined realism as “nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material . . . fidelity to experience and probability of motive.” In this light, he examines the Laphams’ response to the ethical problems posed by economic expansion, their conflicts with an admired and resented Boston aristocracy, and, to give a balanced view of the Laphams’ world, delves into the fields of finance, architecture, and even the details of mineral paint production. This novel still reflects an era in America’s development and offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on our national character.",

He then offered Stauffer $250 to prepare the MLCE collection (Stein to Stauffer, 4 August 1950).",
      "Commins told Stauffer before the book was published, “When the contract was originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition of SELECTED POETRY AND PROSE OF COLERIDGE, we could not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer, 28 June 1951). Stauffer received an additional $100 when the regular ML edition appeared.",

Coleridge’s critical essays, “Romeo and Juliet” and “Hamlet, 1813,” were set fromShakespearean Criticism, ed. T. M. Raysor (Harvard University Press, 1930). The remaining prose was set from Coleridge’sComplete Works, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (7 vols., Harper & Bros., 1853).

      "“There is no greater compliment to be paid the right kind of friend than to hand him Saki, without comment,” writes Christopher Morley in his Introduction to this volume. Hector Hugh Munro, perhaps the best-loved among English humorists and short-story writers, has endeared himself to all kinds of new friends since his death in action during World War One in 1916. The 135 stories in this book of over 700 pages, with the Biography by his sister, Ethel M. Munro, and the Introduction by Christopher Morley keep alive the grace and felicity and whimsical satire of the man who effaced himself in the pseudonym of Saki. (Fall 1951)",

      "Ben Jonson considered John Donne the first among the poets of his time. That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St. Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry and a generous selection of his prose. (Spring 1952)",

      "The ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from Nonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein to Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text.

Coffin received a flat fee of $250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an additional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML. Stein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:",
      "There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever before.

      "Until this century, John Donne’s poetry was excluded from the mainstream of English literature. To his friend Ben Jonson he was “first poet in the world for some things,” but “for not keeping of accent deserved hanging.” Dr. Johnson and Dryden, each a cultural arbiter of his time, shared a low opinion of Donne’s work: according to Dryden, he “affects the metaphysics . . . in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softness of love.”",

Her adventures on safaris, expeditions to Nairobi, her roles as doctor to her neighbors and as hostess to strange guests, reveal a personality as sensitive to the primitive people and the animal life of the Ngong Hills as it was to the ideas that stirred the outside world. “When you have caught the rhythm of Africa,” she wrote, “you find that it is the same in all her music.” The natives, the mountains, the wildlife and trees, all were “different expressions of one idea, variations upon the same theme.” From the vast plains where the wild beasts roam to the snows of Kilimanjaro, from the foothills with the forest behind them to the dry-low country, the home of the giraffe and rhino,Out of Africais a vibrant re-creation of the beauties of the African landscape and the ways of the land and its people.",

      "The Powell-HillJohnsonis one of the monuments of scholarship, probablythegreat edition of any English classic. The reader who wishes to read the entireLife of Johnsonis, of course, referred to this edition. We are grateful to the Oxford University Press for their gracious permission to use the Powell-Hill text in this abridgment.

      "Few men in history have ever been known as intimately as Samuel Johnson. Famous in his own time for his wit and wisdom, he has had the rare good fortune to gain a posthumous extension of personality and influence over a period of more than one hundred and sixty years. James Boswell’s boast that Johnson would “be seen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived” has been borne out in the greatest biography in the English language. To give the modern reader the spirit and substance of Johnson’s life and times, Bergen Evans, Professor of English at Northwestern University, has winnowed out the obscurities and irrelevances of the full text and kept its essence. (Fall 1952)",
      "Original ML abridgment. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25 May 1952.WR7 June 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Also published in MLCE. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.",
      "The ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge Boswell’sLife of Samuel Johnson. Pottle indicated that he was badly behind schedule with Boswell’sJournalfor McGraw-Hill and added, “I have no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’sLife of Johnson. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that to abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will buy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is that the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is, that they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of Boswell’sLife of Johnsonwill continue to be for textbook use in schools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the best offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text with a good index” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951; underlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition ofThe Life of Samuel Johnson(G2) which lacked an index.",
      "Stein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was Bergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’sTristam Shandyin MLCE (1950) and was the author ofThe Natural History of Nonsense(1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis Kronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein memo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in the project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on Johnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography,Samuel Johnson(Henry Holt, 1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have written and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29 June 1951).",
      "Stein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words. “There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and there is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment of Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein to Evans, 10 July 1951).",
      "Evans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’sLife of Samuel Johnson(G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the first 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal number of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is notoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the errors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from Malone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from the definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized its use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to about half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The permission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.",
      "Evans told Stein in a long letter:",
      "I’m enthusiastic about this project. I have cut the book down to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious significance and without having to make any changes whatever except, perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to tell you what had been omitted.",
      "What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly unknown to the common reader.",
      "Evans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts, then hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing of her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no particular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go through the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to cut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I let the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson canon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had cut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its interest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from over 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text again, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000, I believe, nothing whatever of any value or significance . . . was taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it with a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were irrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either the sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and sections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves uninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some unimportant person.”",
      "He concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything like it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . No solid thought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly readable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it might have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951; underlining in original).”",
      "Evans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952. Proofreading was done at Random House.",

      "Among the many suggestions sent to the editors for new additions to the Modern Library, one that recurs most frequently is for the inclusion of James Fenimore Cooper’s favorite among his Leatherstocking Tales. In response to that demand and because of the revival of interest in Cooper’s works,The Pathfinderbecomes the first of his romantic adventure novels to appear in the series. This tale of Cooper’s gallant and resourceful wilderness scout mirrors faithfully the world of Indian warfare and romance of the early American frontier. (Fall 1952)",

      "Cerf considered including one of Cooper’s novels in the ML in 1948 with an introduction by Sterling Lanier of Harvard University. He solicited advice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos Baker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the Hampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George Stewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard Cooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated thatThe Pathfinderwould be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper (Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favoredThe Pathfinder. The response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone a decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must admit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present seems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but I can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters I have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948).",
      "Three years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and asked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf what he thought of a Giant containingThe Deerslayer,The Pilot, andSatanstoe, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite Cooper novel. In the endThe Pathfinderwas published in the regular ML.",

      "Lange suggested a revision of the ML anthologyGreat German Short Novels and Storiesafter writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’sFaustwhich appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930: 200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only collection of German narrative prose in English translation that the student is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely unsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to Stein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein to Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of contents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two exceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for economic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length of the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’sImmenseeinstead of replacing it with the author’sCarsten Curator“because it has become a ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange that “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical sketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the stories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen selections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s original anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a different translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of $500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid the cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for selections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death in Venice” (see 256).",

      "The negotiations that resulted in publication ofSelected Stories of Franz Kafkatook three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’ hopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty over the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to plan a collection of thirteen stories selected fromThe PenalColonyandThe Great Wall of Chinain 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken Books appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the contract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested resuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November 1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would use other translations of the two most important stories and find other material to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).",
      "Commins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and reported:",
      "The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.",
      "I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not, whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.",
      "Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.",
      "I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to Cerf, 8 December 1949)",
      "After analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins reported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken [sic] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items. There are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents which are not protected. These would require new translation, but there would not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are convinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen negotiations with Shocken [sic]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January 1950).",
      "Kurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported that Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation which were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken proposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make a selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help arrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949). Little had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months later. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision ofThe Great Wall of Chinawith additional stories, were still forthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML selection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken to Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May 1951).",
      "Cerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the Kafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could produce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken, 16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952 Random House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the publication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great Wall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It is not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus & Young guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random House’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point Schocken capitulated.",
      "The ML edition ofSelected Stories of Franz Kakfa, reprinted by arrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared three months later.",
      "The ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received $250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been ascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of 5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two printings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders; some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the total of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate within 20,000 copies or so.",

      "This book is one of the best accounts of the colorful period of Italian life and thought between 1350 and 1550. Here is a brilliant panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship between the individual and the forces around him. The combination makes this book one of the few great classics of history. (Spring 1954)",

      "Klopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition ofCivilization of the Renaissance in Italy. Stein thought the idea was a good one and indicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo Holborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some required college sale and am quite confident that it will have a satisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October 1953). Holborn received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11 November 1953).",
      "The ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the public domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf offered George Allen & Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a courtesy fee of $500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any considerable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that will balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities but less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953). The ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen & Unwin and includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C. Middlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged rendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by comparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig Goldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes and has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material preceded by asterisks” (p.

It created methods of reviving the past which will have a lasting influence on the writing of history. Finally, it opened a deep view of the relationship between the human individual and the forces of history.” Rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners and thought of one of the most innovative eras in human history, this brilliant panorama of Renaissance life is also a thorough examination of the nature of civilization and of man’s place within it. Burckhardt’s encyclopedic knowledge, his mastery of style, and his genius for synthesis make this one of the few great classics of history.",

But such additional works asBeppoandThe Vision of Judgment,English Bardsand Scotch Reviewersand the occasional verses penned for his friends show us a poet equally at home in ironic high comedy and biting satire, a poet capable of facing the world and human nature with unwavering realism.

When the ML edition was discontinued Cerf wrote to David Hoffenstein, “I am sorry to say that we cannot possibly keep the Hoffenstein Poetry in the Modern Library.

      "All the elements for thoroughgoing entertainment can be found in this book. The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land remote geographically and in way of life from the western world. It is peopled with potentates and slave girls, robbers and rogues and—above all—a hero, a resourceful, tongue-in-cheek rascal named Hajji Baba. This adventurer’s ups and (mostly) downs take him through every employment from barber to executioner, into caravans, harems, and camps, and introduce him, and us, to every type of individual in the human comedy. We may suspect, as we pursue our hero from one crisis to another, that James Morier is using these tales to comment on the pride, affectation, hypocrisy and chicanery which are universal in human nature, but Hajji Baba himself asks only a relaxed and sympathetic listener for the varied episodes of his career.

      "Random House published an edition ofThe Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahanwith color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938 dividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it was printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s format.",
      "Stein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an introduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of $200, but Haight was too busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953). He then approached Altick, offering him $150. He wrote, “What we have in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving largely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth reading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail, but there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a book published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide pleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first appeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his autobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition of James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection,The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan. . . which, although it never came near to being one of the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints, earned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one of our daughters” (Altick,A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an Adventurous Scholar,p. 200).",
      "Although Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three printings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and spring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume.",
      "Several months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I have just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an advance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I all change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to Altick, 23 September 1954)."

      "This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats, Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes them unmistakably Irish.

Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate, wanted an additional $20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to $12.50 per poem, but this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the sales territory forAn Anthology of Irish Literatureto the U.S. and Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine.

      "Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved.(Fall 1954)",
      "A Curtain of Greenoriginally published with Porter introduction by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published asA Curtain of Green and Other Storiesby Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947.The Wide Net and Other Storiesoriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954.WR16 October 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies.",
      "Cerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt, Brace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager sentA Curtain of Green,The Robber Bridegroom,The Wide Net,Delta Wedding, andThe Golden Apples, expressing the hope that the ML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The reprint contract forSelected Stories of Eudora Weltywas signed a month later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk reports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete information about printings and sales is not available in the RH archives, but the following evidence is suggestive:Selected Stories of Eudora Weltydoes not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than 2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and it sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500 titles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the titles that survived.",
      "Textual variants between the first edition ofA Curtain of Green(Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text of the Modern LibraryA Curtain of Green” (1979). Polk writes:",
      "In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition ofA Curtain of Green. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text ofA Curtain of Greenis two typesettings removed from the first American edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted the Harcourt, Brace text in itsSelected Stories(NY, 1954), it of course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text ofA Curtain of Greenis both the only one currently in print and the text most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6)",
      "In his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the Harcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in print and the one most frequently cited.",

      "The revision ofAn Outline of Psychoanalysis, originally published in 1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision ofAn Outline of Abnormal Psychology(172).

W. W. Norton, the publisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to allow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton expressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the original editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not to have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to Stein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was disturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing (Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by these authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to include them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word.",
      "Anna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to appear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections by their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The Emotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.” Gitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative table of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by & large, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of psychoanalysis.” He continued:",
      "All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel, Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the standpoint from which I view it. . . .",
      "Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the “interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954).",
      "Anna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book,The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense. “My reason for this,” she wrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the other contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter would create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July 1954). Stein replied:",
      "In planning theOutline of Psychoanalysis, we have tried to represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to a proper view of psychoanalysis.

But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your arguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part” (Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954).",

      "Go Down, Mosesis made up of seven inter-related parts, each self-contained, but all illuminating and extending each other. The book might be called a set of variations on two major themes: the changing relationship, from the time of the frontier to the present day, of the Negro and the white man in Yoknapatawpha County, and the relationship of both to the land they inhabit, which in a few generations has been changed from an abundant wilderness into an economic problem. Several of the sections have already achieved individual fame as separate stories, especially “The Bear,” which is one of the highest points in Mr. Faulkner’s achievement, and “The Fire and the Hearth,” which is a kind of prelude to his novel,Intruder in the Dust.

      "The ML paid Coward-McCann a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Publishers were not enthusiastic about McCord’s title. An earlier reprint changed the title toThe Modern Treasury of Humorous Verse(Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition under its subtitle,An Anthology of American and British Humorous and Witty VersewithWhat Cheeras a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16 July 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave five years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he wrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . .What Cheeris short and sweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I wanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I think, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship (the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on to the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954).",
      "McCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he suggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of people, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could not be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if he really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as well without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included the new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.” Permission fees for the new verses came to $220.50; the costs for typesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new to the ML edition were $264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955).",
      "Fifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t setting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it has justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am proud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three years later he had to tell McCord thatWhat Cheerhad “dropped so far below our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the series. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as you know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this kind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959)."

Our world bears little outward relation to the one surveyed by Francis Bacon when, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, he issued his call for the advancement of learning through the method of inductive science. Yet it is precisely his spirit of scientific experimentation which has become the foundation of modern science and, therefore, of the modern world itself. It is then very worth our while to read this volume of Bacon’s greatest writings—theAdvancement of Learning, theNovum Organum, theNew Atlantisand the famousEssays, which show his keen insight into the practical problems of human conduct as well as his mastery of English prose. Professor Dick of the University of California has used various shorter pieces to link these major works and produce in one volume a coherent intellectual autobiography of a great mind.

An indifferent student in his youth, of law, medicine, and pedagogy, he became an honor graduate of the school of human weakness and suffering—for which the eighteenth century provided ample classrooms. When he finally turned to literature, his experiences were not expressed with the satirist’s biting ridicule but with the genuine warmth, humanity, and humor which have made him a beloved friend of generations of readers.

      "People who know Dostoevsky only through such famous novels asThe Brothers KaramazovandCrime and Punishmentwill be surprised and delighted by this collection of stories. It shows Dostoevsky in a variety of moods—tender and romantic in “The White Nights,” satiric in “The Xmas Tree and a Wedding,” revealingly autobiographical in “The Peasant Marey,” pitilessly analytic in “Notes from the Underground,” one of the most significant and impressive things he ever wrote. These stories also show an artistry equal to, and in many ways even surpassing, that of the great novels, powerful and intense as they are.",

      "Cerf had been interested for some time in publishing a collection of Dostoevsky’s stories in the ML (Linscott to Klopfer, 22 September 1954). Several collections, includingPoor Folk & The Gambler(Everyman’s Library, 1915),The Short Novels of Dostoevsky(Dial Press, 1945),The Short Stories of Dostoevsky, ed. William Phillips (Dial Press, 1946) were considered before Magarshack’s volume was selected. Stein offered Magarshack a flat fee of $500 to include his collection in the ML. Magarshack tried to negotiate a 10 percent royalty before accepting the offer (Stein to Magarshack, 3 January 1955). The ML re-titledMemoirs from a Dark Cellarto the more familiarNotes from the Undergroundand changed references to it in Magarshack’s introduction accordingly. The ML had U.S. rights and nonexclusive Canadian rights.",
      "The ML followed the usage of the Lehmann edition in transliterating the author’s name as “Dostoevsky.” All other ML editions of the author’s works used the spelling “Dostoyevsky.” In recent decades “Dostoevsky” has become the most common transliteration of the author’s name in English-language editions of his works. “Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821–1881” remains the “authorized form” used in library catalogs to collocate the nearly 50 variant spellings that have been used to represent the author’s name in the Roman alphabet.",

      "Rejected and neglected when published in 1886,The Bostonianshas now taken its place as the culminating novel of James’s middle period. The harshness of its reception was natural. It satirized the cranks and charlatans of the post-Civil-War era; its hero was a Southerner; and in its portrayal of the relations of its two leading female characters it skirted a subject then taboo—the theme of sexual abnormality. Today the story of the contest between Olive Chancellor, the arch-feminist, and Basil Ransome, the Southern traditionalist, as to which shall mold and dominate the beautiful, guileless Verena Tarrant has come to be recognized as perhaps the most enjoyable of all the James novels.

The young Candide is expelled from the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh for making love to the Baron’s daughter, Cunégonde; and thereafter he, Pangloss and Cunégonde embark on what develops into a long series of adventures. Sometimes together, usually apart, in various corners of the earth, they endure a brutal succession of the most unfair and calamitous events conceivable. Eventually they settle down together on a little farm. Candide marries Cunégonde, now grown ugly as a radish, and tells himself often, “We must cultivate our garden.”",

      "Brave New Worldis a brilliantly satiric novel about life six centuries from now (in “632 After Ford”), the Utopian era in which science has, with juggernaut indifference, triumphed. It is an era of perfect stability, control, conformity. There are, for example, no mothers or fathers because babies are mass-produced from chemical solutions in laboratory bottles; children are completely conditioned for their designated roles as adults in a precisely ordered society. Into this incredible world comes Bernard Marx, hatched in an excessively alcoholic prenatal solution, with ideas worthy of the primitive twentieth century.",

      "The ML expressed interest inBrave New Worldseveral times between 1942 and 1952, but the trade edition was selling too well for Harper’s to consider a reprint. Sales had been small when Harper’s took overBrave New Worldfrom Doubleday but then increased steadily. Sales tripled in 1939;Brave New Worldsold 100 more copies in 1941 than it had in 1939, giving Harper’s a gross profit that year of $300; sales through July 1942 were up 10 percent from the previous year (Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 28 August 1942). Sales remained strong when it was reissued in September 1946 with Huxley’s foreword, with 7,500 copies in print by December (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper & Bros., to Klopfer, 3 December 1946). In 1951 Harper’s sold nearly 2,000 copies in the $3.00 trade edition and 7,500 copies in a 95-cent College Edition (Rose to Cerf, 27 May 1952).",
      "Harper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to editReading for Pleasure, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted” (Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956).",

Peopled as they are with such extraordinary characters as the lovable Tevye, the dairyman, Menachem-Mendel, professional matchmaker, and a host of others, they go beyond their faithful portrayal of the life of the Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern Europe to represent, in a way unequaled by any other writer, the Jewish soul.

A year before Chekhov’sBest Playswas published Stein had reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern Library were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer regarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the excellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,The Cherry Orchard,The Three Sisters,Uncle Vanya, andThe Sea Gull. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to Lois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights; there seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this stage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange for the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of course go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo to Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”",

Immediately popular in Russia, Chekhov’s plays soon were produced all over Europe.

The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well, damn their eyes.",

If you say “No” this time, I promise never to mention the matter again.",
      "I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence, “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment. This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly concerned even remembers?",
      "I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and, furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. [Harold] Ross, who was Editor of the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead; [Brendan] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.",
      "I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands, several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.",
      "There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).",
      "There is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably telephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf immediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an introduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).",

We knew it didn’t stand a chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:",
      "One important change has been made in the text here offered, and another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the wordAsiaticwhen used to describe themselves. I have changed this word toAsian. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps even greater fervor the wordChinaman. After my first several books appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I have corrected this offensive word toChinese; but in certain stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).",
      "Michener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication ofTales of the South Pacific. He signed with Random House on 19 April 1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August 2010). His second book,The Fires of Spring, was published by Random House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a 1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old Mansion,”PW, 13 July 1946, p. 174).",

      "This thoroughly enjoyable collection is almost a biography of Damon Runyon, the boy who grew up in the West, rode the rods, knew what the inside of jails was like, wrote sports, reported abroad, and became Mr. Broadway. Here are represented the wide range of his experiences and of his writing—early Westerns and sketches of “folks back home” with vivid titles likeThe Wooing of Nosey GillespieandAt Dead Mule Crossing; or tales, likeThe Informal Execution of Soupbone Pew, picked up in the hobo jungles. From his days as a newspaper reporter and syndicated columnist come accounts likeThe Main Event, sports verse likeA Handy Guy Like Sande, and affectionate sketches of “ordinary” people like those of Joe and Ethel Turp or My Old Man. And finally, from Runyon’s great days as a Broadway chronicler, we have Hot Horse Herbie, Nicely Nicely, Gentleman George and their fantastic cronies, speaking again in these pages the peculiar vernacular now immortalized as Runyonese.

The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented, and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of mind.”",

The story of three young men—a Nazi, a Jew, and an American—The Young Lionstakes place bestween [sic] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross fatally in a Bavarian forest.

Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups that patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8 January 1958).

Thornhill gave six months’ termination notice forCatcher in the Ryeand indicated that the ML would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to Klopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to Salinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important books in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified a manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000 copies ofCatcher in the Ryeand over 37,000 copies ofNine Storiesand asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another three years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963).",

Klopfer indicated in July that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no more printings ofCatcher in the Rye(Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July 1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is included in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer 1964 stock list.",
      "The ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering hope that Salinger might change his mind.Catcher in the RyeandNine Storieswere listed inPublishers’ Trade List Annualthrough 1965 and continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through 1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new titles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number ofCatcher in the Rye, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 whenFour Contemporary French Plays(598) was published as ML 90.",

He also suggested updating several references in the stories and changing the title toA Gathering of Jeeves(Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August 1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked Wodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that he weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that for Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also asked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories. “Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period and . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary confusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent admirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the titleSelected Stories. “The latter [A Gathering of Jeeves] may sound a little bit better, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell best when they state very clearly what the book contains, without reaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August 1957).",
      "Wodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared inNew World Writing, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92."

Zevin to Cerf, 4 May 1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of theAmerican College Dictionaryin 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By deleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the content to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the dictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting theAmerican College Dictionaryby 50 percent would require making much sharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a Giant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete withThe Concise Oxford Dictionary, the Funk and WagnallsDesk Standard Dictionary, and theWinston Advanced Dictionary(School Edition). He estimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and that editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott, 18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans to publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned.TheModern Library Dictionary(1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000 entries.",
      "The Modern Library Dictionarywas shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall 1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because new business machines acquired by Random House could not handle number-letter combinations. Copies ofThe Modern Library Dictionarythat remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number “1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.",

The following year Klopfer turned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in Vintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback edition becauseCollected Poetrywas selling so well (Klopfer to Alfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).",
      "The ML reprintedW. H. Auden: A Selection by the Authorbecause Auden did not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered buying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S. copyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been set in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention, which the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement for works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S. citizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer wrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might invalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set of proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of uncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the Penguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7 July 1958).",

      "One evening, in the year 1546, Giorgio Vasari, a Florentine painter and architect, was dining in Rome with the celebrated Cardinal Farnese. The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”",
      "Four years laterLives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architectswas published in Florence. The time and the man had come together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian Renaissance.",
      "Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (Fall 1959)",

      "Linscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He originally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs. Jonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the DeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser translation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000 words.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the manuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s worth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates” (Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume DeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the U.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of pictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable moralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential Vasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to change the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has been done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a building it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American readers” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).",
      "Linscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he thought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and an expensive illustrated edition by S & S [Simon and Schuster] with disgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print. Instead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff, inaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly accurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957)."

      "Cerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the ML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your Modern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to take with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE FURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the time the book was published, in your list [Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,was published by Cape & Smith in 1929]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will be a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us up.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few volumes. He requested Joyce’sPortrait of the Artist as a Young Manand any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books in which a Dostoyefsky [sic] influence was found. I have never read Dostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf, 15 April 1931).",
      "Cerf and Klopfer wanted to includeThe Sound and the FuryorAs I Lay Dying, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type which had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s audience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the cost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in production and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House between 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for books without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was cheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the possibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year or so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be instructed to melt the type (Harter,The Making ofWilliam Faulkner’s Books, 1929–1939, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult for reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive reprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial publication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from the original publisher’s plates.",
      "Faulkner’s next book,Sanctuary, had more commercial appeal. It was the only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were made. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback. The American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet Books—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight printings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies (Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on front cover).",
      "In his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he initially wroteSanctuaryfor money. The introduction begins:",
      "This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea, because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been writing books for about five years, which got published but not bought. . . .",
      "Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)",
      "After sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job working the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between 12 and 4, I wroteAs I Lay Dyingin six weeks, without changing a word. I sent it to Smith [his publisher] and wrote him that by it I would stand or fall.” He continues:",
      "I think I had forgotten aboutSanctuary, just as you might forget about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.As I Lay Dyingwas published and I didn’t remember the mss. ofSanctuaryuntil Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting it, trying to make out of it something which would not shameThe Sound and the FuryandAs I Lay Dyingtoo much and I made a fair job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)",
      "Faulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than the rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be reset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees Book Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the introduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like Burck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when E. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger format.",
      "Faulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith & Haas.Sanctuaryremained his only title in the ML until 1946, whenThe Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying(394) were published together in a single volume.",

All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dyingwas the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML, followed byLight in August(429),Absalom, Absalom!(434), andSanctuary(233), which sold 4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.",

      "Generation after generation of Americans has been brought up on the poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. To him can be attributed a major share of what love for poetry great masses of our people cherish. Such poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great lyricists of our national literature. (Spring 1938)",
      "Original ML collection. Published April 1932.WR7 May 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.",
      "Longfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his time. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when Longfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes substantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at Harvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death he received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice what he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained sufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin Co., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher, Ticknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced its edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott at Houghton Mifflin:",
      "A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we first noticed your announcement . . . [Longfellow is the] Poet of Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”",
      "Linscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for which the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy acknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).",
      "The ML initially intended to base its edition onThe Poems of Henry W. Longfellow, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library series. Linscott wrote again four days later:",
      "You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow” which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19 January 1932).",
      "Linscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete Cambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.",
      "At this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant figure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537), intervened. He wrote Cerf:",
      "I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it [the Longfellow matter]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.",
      "Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France,et cetera, or can you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February 1932)",
      "Both Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of Longfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to Linscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932). Linscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may have gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the circumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at present” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).",
      "In the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the copyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include nearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.",
      "When the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who acknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best wishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML edition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a new typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that had entered the public domain since 1932.",
      "The Poems of LongfellowandThe Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and Franklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket forThe Poems of Longfellowremained in use until the early 1940s.",
      "Cerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s, but it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s.The Poems of Longfellowsold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed services. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on to its first-quarter ranking.",

      "The wide range of Benjamin Franklin’s interests and activities opened the doors of the world to him. Printer, inventor, philosopher, diplomat, champion of liberty, he made his influence felt not only upon his own time, but upon every American generation. His wise maxims and shrewd observations have become national axioms. HisAutobiography, as rich in material as it is engaging in style, is one of those rare documents that reveals both a rich personality and the crucial events that transpired during his lifetime.

      "Cerf originally planned to publish Franklin’sAutobiographyby itself. Three months before publication he decided to add more of Franklin’s writings so the book would be a better value. Goodman, who suggested the additional contents, received $100 for his work on the volume.",
      "The Autobiography of Benjamin FranklinandThe Poems of Longfellow(235) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and Longfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from this day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press unless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both the typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think that the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to William Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).",
      "The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed pictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first printing are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained in use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive jackets the ML ever used.",
      "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklinsold 5,569 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.

      "The ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’sSun Also Rises(190). Cerf initially hoped to publishA Farewell to Armsin September 1931 (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931 publication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January 1932).",

      "The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated interest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his personal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself have bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk about a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he stated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in the Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and I have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the author’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint contract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a warm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the Modern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is released” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).",
      "When the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed Klopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the Readers Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s president, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was available (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and convinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail order sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would like to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the option to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer to Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty remained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed in 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but without an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the ML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club edition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).",
      "In 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in addingA High Wind in Jamaicaand Richard Wright’sNative Son(349) to the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper director of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the ML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had textbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer replied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition from an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department wants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the Modern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956).",

      "The world owes to the unchallenged master of the short story, Guy de Maupassant, an immense and increasing debt for having provided a transcript of life as dynamic as it is real and as true as it is fascinating. The forty tales in this volume represent him in the fullness of his powers, when his vision, style and artistry were at their apex. These stories were chosen and translated by Michael Monahan, whose introduction is a bold commentary and an acute analysis of Maupassant’s work. (Fall 1935)",

      "Cerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on the title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not strictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation of “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and unabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the stories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional phrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I believe it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged” (Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML made three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to Walter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the book for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in September 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition in November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap borrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition, paying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).",

The selections fromThe German IdeologyandCritique of Political Economyin Part II were added by the ML.",
      "Cerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932). Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a Russian magazine calledEducation. To this very orthodox statement by Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p. xix).",
      "Shortly after the publication ofCapital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested, Declined” under 1933 for more information.",
      "M. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack of an indextoCapital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings: “I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to Schuster, 8 February 1933).",

      "The years that have passed since the World War have been severe to the literature of that disastrous episode in human history. Only a few books have survived. Of these,Three Soldiersstands pre-eminent. It reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile.Three Soldiersintroduced a writer who has since become a major figure among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests securely. (Spring 1935)",
      "Originally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled for November 1932.WR17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1963.",
      "Eight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday, Doran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern Library, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and Three Soldiers.” He asked how many copiesThree Soldiershad sold in the trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial Library (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that the plates forThree Soldierswere too large for the ML’s format he contacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’sManhattan TransferandThe 42nd Parallel.Manhattan Transferhad sold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 forThe 42nd Parallel(Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those titles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin withThree Soldiersand addedThe 42nd Parallel(307) to the ML five years later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos Passos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.",
      "ForThree Soldiersthe ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his corrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know if I made more corrections in theThree Soldierstext than you can handle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were just going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was away when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked Cerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling corrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were. The introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was doing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf, undated).",
      "Three Soldierssold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from Doubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500 copies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20 August 1946).Three Soldiersdid not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
      "Houghton Mifflin withdrewThree Soldiersand Dos Passos’sU.S.A.(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality paperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination agreement in June and instructed the production department to make no more printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June 1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock and asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to bring outThree Soldiersuntil the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick Moseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated that the ML had 3,000 copies ofThree Soldiers, enough to last about a year, and a six- to eight-month supply ofU.S.A.(Klopfer to Moseley, 22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire ifThree Soldierswas out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was (Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January 1964).Three Soldierswas published in Sentry Editions later that year.",
      "Three Soldierswas dropped from separately published ML catalogs after fall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the end of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned toThe Buddhist Tradition, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring 1969 after the oversight was discovered.",

      "Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations. Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second only to the furore created by his ownTrilby. Then as a play, it has been, since 1915, a perennial favorite. As an opera, with a score by Deems Taylor, it found a prominent place in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and, finally as a cinema, it has reached countless thousands of people. In its original form, it remains a book of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (Spring 1937)",

The paper order for the first printing may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing of 8,000 copies and received 7,450.",

Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice Firuski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the translation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by T. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on Dante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent of Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski, 28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an introduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to Grandgent, 25 July 1932).

Grandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using and knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the best translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher (Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an inferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the Temple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph by the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of the English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle, Thomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is clear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be readily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its scholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p. xiii).",
      "The Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’sDivine Comedythe best translations have been followed:Inferno, by John Aiken Carlyle;Purgatorio, by Thomas Okey;Paradisio, by Philip H. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim) follow, in the main, the excellent notes for theInfernoand thePurgatorioby Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr. Oeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for theParadisio” (251.1, p. 3; 251.2, p. xvii).",
      "ML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to the translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the translator ofPurgatorio. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations were not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML printings until 1963/64 (251.2c).",
      "Shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S. Singleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation ofThe Divine Comedyfor the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working on a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled to be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the approval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after theirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances totaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took longer than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years later it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The Bollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and 1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary. By that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become moribund and had ceased adding new titles.",
      "The Divine Comedysold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant titles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.",

He told the RH editor David McDowell: “Honest—that ML Greek Poets is awful. ‘Dedicated to proving the proposition that Western European literature is founded on the work of a number of vulgar sentimentalists who wrote illiterate doggerel.’ As somebody once said.

      "Margaret Mead’s study of adolescence in a primitive civilization has become one of the classics of modern anthropological research. Even more than a scientific observer of folkways, Margaret Mead was an actual participant in the communal life of a Samoa untouched by Western culture. This record of the psycho-sexual development of pagan youth is an intimate and fascinating contribution to anthropology, ethnography, sociology and psychology. By her comparisons between primitive and modern attitudes toward eroticism, the emotional differences in two remote social and cultural orders are brilliantly illuminated.Coming of Age in Samoais a book of enduring scientific and literary importance. (Spring 1953)",

      "My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind, and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.” I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim, by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social invention—are far less likely to seem dated.

      "Stein prepared a list of six of Shaw’s plays that he considered desirable for a ML collection:Arms and the Man,Candida,Major Barbara,Pygmalion,Heartbreak House, andSaint Joan. The only important play omitted, he told Cerf, wasMan and Supermanwhich had a very long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final selection, including the addition ofCaesar and Cleopatra, was probably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction (Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953).",
      "It was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure permission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight control over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of his plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his opposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to publish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s,Four PlaysandSaint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion(1956: 484). The only other volume by Shaw in the ML was his early novelAn Unsocial Socialist(15), published in the series in fall 1917. Originally published in 1887, four years before the United States extended the possibility of U.S. copyright to works by foreign authors, it was in the U.S. public domain.",

      "The novel by which Robert Penn Warren compelled immediate national attention and for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 has already established itself as one of the notable books in all American fiction. His story of Willie Stark, the power-impelled, back-country demagogue, driven and corrupted by success, is a drama of many strands. Interwoven among them all is the central figure of a rogue strong and charming and ruthless enough to seduce either a close friend or an unruly mob. For intensity of action, for an unfailing ear for native colloquialism and for insight into the character and motivations of a man drunk with the compulsion to power, there is no comparable American novel.

      "The enormous influence Hegel has exercised on modern politics and philosophy, on social science, anthropology and psychology demands an examination and evaluation of his most important works, so presented and annotated as to make them comprehensible in themselves and in their relationship to the contemporary world. The essence of Hegelian thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history, philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general reader.The Philosophy of Hegelbecomes another addition to the Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (Fall 1953)",
      "Original ML collection. Published fall 1953.WR24 October 1953. First printing: Not ascertained.",
      "Friedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a copy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his edition ofThe Philosophy of Kant(422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14 December 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the job” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to the ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a devout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept. think of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late 1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly all of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations about its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead (Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951).",
      "Friedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of selections fromThe Philosophy of Historyand about fifty pages ofLectures on AestheticsandPhilosophy of Right and Law. The translation of the main part ofThe Philosophy of Historyis based on the John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in 1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that he was having to do more work on the translations than he originally hoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952).",
      "In the first printing the selections from the Introduction toThePhilosophy of History(460a, pp. [1]–43) are from “a translation made by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor, and published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)” (“Note,” p. [2]). Beginning with the second printing the selections from the Introduction (460b, pp. [1]–43) are “translated by Carl J. Friedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind permission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p. [2]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first printing and resetting pp. [1]–42 has not been ascertained.",
      "Friedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold reasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and gratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to Klopfer, 18 January 1960).",

      "The figure of William Blake, poet and prophet, visionary and romantic, exerts a perennial fascination for all lovers of literature. Now, to join its ever-growing representation of the great English poets, the Modern Library makes available a distinguished volume of Blake’s work, including some of his illustrations, chosen by Northrop Frye of the University of Toronto. In addition to selections from the lyrics and shorter poems, from the “prophetic books” such asThe Four Zoas,MiltonandJerusalem, there is a generous section of prose which includes letters and some epigrammatic and revealing marginalia. Professor Frye’s Introduction provides a commentary which illuminates both the simplicity of the lyrics and the difficult but consistent symbolism of the prophecies. (Spring 1953)",

He told Stein, “I have a strong personal repugnance to bits-and-pieces anthologizing, and do this only because I don’t at the moment see anything better to do” (Frye to Stein, 27 September 1952). So little of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get it all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the shorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early prose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they belonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia were included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye to Stein, 5 December 1952). Frye suggested the inclusion of the illustrations (Frye to Stein, 9 June 1952). The original plan was to use ten illustrations, but the number was reduced to eight so they could be bound in as a four-leaf gathering.",

Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to setRestoration Playsfrom first editions of all of the plays exceptThe Rehearsal, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition (Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured photostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A textual note similar to the one quoted in the entry forEighteenth-Century Playsappears on p.

The volume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was twice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the regular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary to Harris, 5 May 1953)."

The art of the short story in America was significantly advanced by Poe, who also shaped the development of the detective story.",
      "Poe’s ability to blend the macabre and surreal with consummate craftsmanship has remained a memorable contribution to American literature. (Spring/Fall 1968)",

      "Mabbott received a flat fee of $250 for writing the introduction and selecting the contents. Stein sent him an additional $100 when the collection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June 1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been determined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD ARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However, it occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we have a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poemThe Sleeperon the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in the final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He suggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether (Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950).",
      "How to Write a Blackwood Articledoes not appear inThe Selected Poetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in the introduction appears to have been cut.The Sleeperis included in its final text.",
      "“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A. Harrison’sComplete Works of Edgar Allan Poeby the kind permission of the publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed from the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case ofThe Cask of Amontillado, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In one or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but preferred by most critics. Poe was a meticulous and thorough reviser of his imaginative works, and instances of unwise revision are exceptionally rare.” (“Note,” p. xvi)",
