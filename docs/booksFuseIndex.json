It is not merely a ‘book of the season’ or ‘book of the year’; it will stand on  the shelves of cultivated people, of people whose taste in reading is both wide and good, as long as men and women appreciate charm of form in the writings of men who also combine love of daring adventure with the power to observe and vividly to record the things of strange interest which they have seen. . . . If I had space I would like to give an abstract of the whole book. As it is I merely advise all who love good books, very good books, at once to get this book of Mr. Beebe’s.” THEODORE ROOSEVELT (*Fall 1925*)     \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)     \n\n> Front flap: <br> As a trained scientific observer, William Beebe has conducted many expeditions at sea and into the jungle. The wealth of data collected by him and the vivid tales of adventure he has brought back constitute a record unique among books of exploration. In *Jungle Peace* he describes a remote and glamorous segment of the world —Guiana — and creates a picture of tropical splendor and mystery. He tells of birds and beasts, plants and insects with the accuracy of the scientist and the wonder of a born story-teller. (*Spring 1934*)   \n\nOriginally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1918.

Discontinued 1 January 1941.   \n\nRoosevelt’s foreword originally appeared as a front-page review in the *New York Times Review of Books* (13 October 1918) and was added as a foreword to later Holt printings.   \n\nThere were at least eleven ML printings between fall 1925 and August 1937 totaling 21,000 copies, including a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1925. *Jungle Peace* sold 1,706 copies during the first half of 1928, placing it fifty-sixth out of 147 ML titles.     \n\n",

The novel and the play have been blown about the world at a fearful rate, but the story has never lost its happy juvenility, a charm that nothing can vulgarize. It is all champagne and tears - fresh perversity, fresh credulity, fresh passion, fresh pain. We have seen the play both well done and ill done – in strange places, in barbarous tongues. But nothing makes any difference – it carries with it an April air: some tender young man and some coughing young woman have only to speak the lines to give it a great place among the love-stories of the world. HENRY JAMES (*Spring 1928*)     \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front abridged from Henry James quotation on jacket A: “A novel and play that have been blown about the world—but nothing can alter it. It is all champagne and tears—fresh passion, fresh pain—one of the great love stories of the world.” <span class=\"smallcaps\">Henry James</span> (*Fall 1930*)     \n\n> Front flap: <br> New generations of readers respond as their parents and grandparents did with unashamed tears to the sad plight of the beautiful and doomed Marguerite Gautier. *Camille* retains its fragrance through the years; it is a tale that stirs an unassuageable heartache, and over it there hovers a sentiment forever tender and yearning. It is read now as it was before and as it will be read years hence as the love story of the eternal Magdalene glorified by her passion and misfortune. (*Spring 1934*)     \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in strong yellowish pink (26), pale blue (185) and black on coated cream paper depicting a woman seated in an open coach driven by a bearded coachman; title in strong yellowish pink with three-dimensional shading in black, other lettering in black. Signed: Galdone. Front flap as jacket B. (*Spring 1939*)   \n\nTranslation originally published in U.S. as *The Lady of the Camellias* in the French Classical Romances series (D. Appleton & Co., 1902). The source of the plates has not been identified; the ML edition may have been printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25 October 1925. *WR* 14 November 1925. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970.   \n\nGosse was editor-in-chief of the French Classical Romances series. His introduction and biographical note are taken from the Appleton edition, where the ML introduction constitutes the last third (pp. xxiii–xxxii) of his longer critical essay, “The Novels of Alexandre Dumas the Younger.” The ML paid Appleton a permissions fee of \\$25 for their use. The translation appears to have been in the public domain.     \n\n*Camille* sold 2,340 copies during the first half of 1928, placing it thirty-sixth among 147 ML titles.

For a rereading of PINAFORE, PATIENCE, THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD and RUDDIGORE, all of them contained in this one volume, will convince them anew that there is only one Gilbert, and that, futhermore [*sic*], his myriad of imitators fade into utter nothingness beside the brilliance and undying sparkle of his famous songs and ballads. \nAnother Modern Library volume (number 26) contains THE MIKADO, THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE, IOLANTHE, and THE GONDOLIERS.

These do not present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died before the book was half done.  The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to complete his work. (*Fall 1925*)     \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)     \n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform philosophy jacket in moderate green (145) and black on cream paper. Signed: WC.     \n\n> Front flap: <br> The world recognizes that William James stands pre-eminent among the philosophers of America. His writings have had an influence that has reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (*Fall 1934*)   \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published December 1925. *WR* 19 December 1925. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.   \n\nKallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on *The Philosophy of William James*. His royalties during the first six months of 1926 totaled \\$179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions fees to James’s original publishers. A few days after *The Philosophy of William James* was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined. The ML published *Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell* (147) in October 1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial work appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926 Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was interested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the project three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which published most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary permissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection, *The Philosophy of Santayana*, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942 (see 355).   \n\nSales of *The Philosophy of William James* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.     \n\n#### 119b.

The statuary found a granite block on a solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least one element of grandeur—power.

With time and labour, the crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the giant’s foot. CHARLOTTE BRONTË  \n\nML edition printed from duplicate plates of the edition published in 1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. Published January 1926. *WR* 6 February 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1978.  \n\nMacaulay had agreed to write an introduction to *Wuthering Heights* when the ML was published by B&L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925 (B&L advertisement, *PW*, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction failed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just bought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited England in June but was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he wrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a short introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s “Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I would therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction within a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than four or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of \\$50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6 August 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After thanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your own books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an ideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September 1925).  \n\nA slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included in the British edition of *Wuthering Heights* published in 1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first paragraph of the introduction concludes with the following three sentences:  \n\n> There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that every available fact about their personalities and lives is now familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired, never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.  \n\nIn the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the words, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives is now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts at all.”  \n\nExcept for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are printed from identical plates. The only difference is that the Travellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the first page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other Travellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a duplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement may have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.  \n\nThe title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay (“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.  \n\nBlue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay introduction, for a 1939 printing of *Wuthering Heights* in its new reprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and sold for 39 cents a copy.  \n\nSales of *Wuthering Heights* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably reflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion of *Wuthering Heights* as one of the first titles in Modern Library College Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for classroom use.  \n\n#### 120.1b.

The romantic story of the destruction caused by the frustrated love of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, set against the moors of England, creates a rare blend of violence and beauty.  \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML. ML edition (pp. xxvii‑xxxii, [1]–400) printed from plates originally made for the Illustrated Modern Library with pagination of the Editor’s Preface revised. In ML and MLCE printings Charlotte Brontë’s Biographical Notice is reset in smaller type to match that of Gettman’s introduction. ML and MLCE printings include Eichenberg’s wood-engraved chapter heads that were made for the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 18) but not the full-page wood engravings.  \n\nThe Illustrated Modern Library edition of *Wuthering Heights* (IML 18), published in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new typesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition of *Wuthering Heights* had a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only. For the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional wood engravings for the chapter heads. Since *Wuthering Heights* consists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice and one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.  \n\nNew plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for subsequent printings of the regular ML edition. This appears to have been the intention, since the preliminaries for the regular ML edition of *Wuthering Heights*, including Macaulay’s introduction, were reset to match the rest of the text. However, the original plates were used when the regular ML edition of *Wuthering Heights* (120.1c) was reprinted in fall 1947. No regular ML printings with the reset text have been seen prior to 120.2a, when the Illustrated Modern Library plates were used with a new introduction by Royal A. Gettmann.  \n\nGettmann received \\$150 for his introduction (Stein to Gettmann, 24 January 1950).  \n\n#### 120.2b.

[1].  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B1.  \n\n> Text on front: <br> POOR WHITE tells the story of the American power that dots a vast valley with cities overnight, and builds a network of industry, making quick men rich and fearful men poor. The hero works for this force although he doesn’t like or understand it. He is a dreamy, rather stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made [*sic*] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s” love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is fulfilled. (*Fall 1925)*  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a supreme position among American novelists. *Poor White*, like *Winesburg, Ohio* (No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world celebrated. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking Press, August 1925. ML edition (pp. [1]–371) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings. Published February 1926. *WR* 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1939.  \n\nWhen Anderson became a B&L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed interest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including *Poor White* in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April 1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s contract with B&L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately endeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in writing, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library” (contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML before *Poor White* could be added to the series. It is not known whether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or after the sale.  \n\nFor writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML books instead of the usual \\$50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925). He wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to be published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to call on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long rows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little like a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city” (ML ed., p. vi).  \n\nThe dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was divorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request (Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication was inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).  \n\nSales of *Poor White* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th out of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies by April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000 copies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\nAnderson, *Winesburg, Ohio* (1921–1973) 96  \n\n",

(*Fall 1925*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n> Text on front: <br> This romance originally published under the title of “The Virgins of the Rocks”, was written by D’Annunzio when his position as the greatest modern Italian master of prose was already secure. Other of his novels in the Modern Library series are “The Flame of Life”, (volume number 65), “The Child of Pleasure”, (volume number 98), and “The Triumph of Death”, (volume number 112). (*Spring 1926*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Richmond & Son, 1898, and subsequently by L. C. Page & Co., 1902. ML edition (pp. [1]–296) printed from Richmond/Page plates. Publication announced for May 1926. *WR* 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1928.  \n\nLewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so aggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you, it appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that are absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the privilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being, at least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list, although some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder or The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box 128, L. C. Page & Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm commitment on Liveright’s part to include both *The Maidens of the Rocks* and *The Intruder* in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the series he demanded that they pay advances of \\$240 against royalties of 8 cents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him \\$480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other the following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10 September 1925).  \n\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the beginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year. Page responded with a pitch for *The Intruder*, noting that it was part of the trilogy that included *The Child of Pleasure* and *The Flame of Life* and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described *The Maidens of the Rocks* as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough story, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers of the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind any of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always run neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to the two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He concluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the other three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want children’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page to Cerf, 7 February 1927).  \n\nCerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The Intruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the advance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong feeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library with a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> D’Annunzio, *Flame of Life* (1918–1936) 62<br> D’Annunzio, *Triumph of Death* (1923–1931) 102<br> D’Annunzio, *Child of Pleasure* (1925–1931) 113  \n\n",

It stands quite alone; it strikes a note no other sea writer has ever struck. It is a work not only unique of its kind, but a great achievement—the expression of an imagination that rises to the highest, and so is amongst the world’s great works of art.” —<span class=\"smallcaps\">John Masefield</span> *(The Modern Library edition of “Moby Dick” is complete and unabridged).* (*Fall 1926*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*)  \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in strong red (12) and black on cream paper with inset black-and-white illustration by Rockwell Kent of a ship under full sail; title and borders in strong red with title superimposed over Kent illustration, other lettering in black. (*Spring 1932*) *Note:* Kent’s illustration was created for the 3-volume limited edition of *Moby Dick* published by Lakeside Press in 1930. Later that year Random House published a one-volume trade edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting; the MLG edition (G65) printed from RH plates appeared in 1944. Kent’s illustration appears on p. 81 of RH/MLG printings. The reproduction of the illustration on jacket C is slightly cropped at the foot.  \n\n> Front flap: <br> Of the comparatively few books in the world’s literature about which it is safe to foretell the verdict of posterity, *Moby Dick* stands in the first rank. Universally recognized as one of the greatest of all tales of the sea, it will live by its own surge and elemental force. This mighty history of the pursuit of the vindictive monster, upon which Herman Melville lavished all the resources of his imagination and Jovian hate, is the symbol and the substance of reckless adventure and indomitable courage. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published June 1926. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1976/77.  \n\nMelville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The Library of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s, published in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to nineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank. Emerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf Whittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range PS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of nine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in 1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea romances like *Typee* and *Omoo*. *Moby-Dick* sold poorly when it was published in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.  \n\nThe critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the publication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, *Herman Melville: Mariner and Mystic* (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of *Billy Budd*, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver edited the manuscript and published it in *Billy Budd and Other Prose Pieces* (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years later in *Shorter Novels of Herman Melville* (Horace Liveright, 1928).  \n\nWeaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His biography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated with a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published autobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia University’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course in Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this man had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . . and discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and a wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 17–18).  \n\nWeaver wrote introductions to two editions of *Moby-Dick* that were published as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way. His introduction to the edition published by Albert & Charles Boni in 1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the following year for the ML.  \n\nThe ML may have tried to position its edition of *Moby-Dick* to appeal both to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated the darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from Masefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful romance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic, all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s introduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the malice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of leperous [*sic*] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).  \n\nSales of *Moby Dick* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943 it was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of *Moby Dick* from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand following American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven printings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of 2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling 23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).  \n\nCerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of *Moby Dick* under the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar “specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton House titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a departure from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality paper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and were sold in black slipcases at a retail price of \\$2.50. The ML printed 500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department stores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do well with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated that they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one of those years when even \\$2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to Cerf, 18 August 1932).  \n\nThe ML also published *Moby Dick* (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series, using plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.  \n\nAll ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the spelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead of the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of the work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of America edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions that omit it.  \n\nThe Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new typesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick, is inconsistent. The title is *Moby-Dick or, The Whale*, but the biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as *Moby Dick*, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated form when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form when referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983), which includes *Redburn* and *White-Jacket* as well as *Moby-Dick*, uses the hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages (pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record chapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen, with the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp. 985–991) are MOBY DICK.  \n\n#### 124b.

(*Spring 1953*)  \n\n> Front flap revised: <br> In the little more than one hundred years since *Moby Dick* was first published, critics have probed its inexhaustible symbolic treasures. The general reader has also found great wealth as he participated in the hunt for the white whale. He encountered an adventure story of magnificent sweep and suspense. From its incomparably effective opening sentence, “Call me Ishmael,” to its dramatic end when the white whale triumphs and all hands, except Ishmael, perish, Melville makes everyone—the reader most of all—share Captain Ahab’s obsessive belief that he alone can destroy the white, evil leviathan. *Moby Dick* is more than a tale of the pursuit of a monster; it is an allegory of relentless hatred and evil redeemed by man’s indomitable courage. (*Fall 1954*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita pictorial jacket in deep blue (179), deep reddish orange (36) and black on coated white paper with inset wood engraving of whale destroying a whaling boat; lettering in deep blue, deep reddish orange and black, all against white background.  \n\n> Front flap: <br> “*Moby Dick* possesses an unusual, if not unique, literary form which cannot be compared to that of the conventional novel, drama or travel book. It is a realistic story of life aboard a whaling vessel, a romance of adventure and strange characters, a drama of heroic determination and conflict and a technical treatise on whaling. . . . Because of its unconventional complexity, it is a disturbing book. . . . Like all great books, *Moby Dick* has the potentiality of enriching itself with the substance of each new reader’s emotions and ideas, and it has grown greater in its implications with the passage of time.” —from the Introduction by Leon Howard \n\nOriginally published with the Howard introduction in MLCE (1950) and subsequently in the regular ML. Professor Austin Warren of the University of Michigan was originally invited to write the introduction. He agreed to a deadline of 30 March and a \\$200 fee but withdrew two days before it was due, pleading illness and expressing dissatisfaction with the fee compared to the royalty offered by the competing series Rinehart Editions (Albert Erskine to Warren, 26 January 1950; Warren to Erskine, 28 March 1950). Erskine turned to Leon Howard, then at Northwestern University, who agreed to write the introduction for the \\$200 fee (Erskine to Howard, 31 March 1950).  \n\nMelville’s dedication to Nathaniel Hawthorne, omitted from earlier ML printings, is included in 124c.  \n\n#### 124d.

(*Fall 1925*) *Note:* The copyright statement on p. [*4*] is an error; the book does not contain an introduction.  \n\n*Jacket:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n> Text on front: <br> In this novel—which the editors of the Modern Library consider one of the greatest in the English language—Thomas Hardy reaches the high water mark of his glorious genius. There are scenes in this book, and characters, that will burn themselves into the memory of the reader, never to be forgotten; passages of writing whose sheer beauty is unsurpassed in all literature. “The Return of the Native” is dominated by the tragic overtones of the Hardy conviction of inevitability—the powerlessness of man before his fate. (*Spring 1926*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Henry Holt & Co., 1878. New bibliographical edition with Hardy’s 1895 Preface and map of Hardy’s Wessex published by Harper & Brothers, 1895; plates used for successive Harper printings, including a 1922 printing in Harper’s Modern Classics. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–[509]) printed from Harper plates. Published August 1926. *WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\n*The Return of the Native* was the fourth best-selling title in the ML during the first six months of 1928. It ranked low in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 4 cents a copy. Sales of the ML edition totaled 42,543 copies by December 1930. Printings between August 1931 and November 1939 totaled at least 24,000 copies.  \n\n#### 126b.

Signed: Hynd. (*Spring 1929*) *Note:* The ML experimented with several pictorial jackets in 1929 in connection with three boxed sets of three titles each that were intended for sale as Christmas gifts. The boxed sets, which were sold primarily in department stores, were *Three Great French Romances*, *Three Great Renaissance Romances*, and *Three Great Modern Novels*. Hynd’s jackets for each title in the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box—Butler, *Way of All Flesh* (13.1d jacket B) and Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (171.1a jacket B) in addition to *The Return of the Native*—were exceptional examples of expressionist graphics. Their use was confined to the 1929 gift box and they were never used on copies of the books sold separately.  \n\n#### 126c.

(*Fall 1929*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> Kinship with nature and tenderness with human frailty characterize Thomas Hardy’s brooding and powerful novel, *The Return of the Native*. He sets his stage on the heaths and in the villages of his beloved Wessex and unfolds a drama that becomes the living symbol for the universal struggle of existence. His characters have the solidity of the landscape against which they enact their tragic fates, and if one stands out above the others, she is Eustacia Vye, as memorable a woman as life or the art of Thomas Hardy could create. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial, probably a smaller version of 126d jacket. Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1938; probably unsigned. (*Not seen*)  \n\nThe Harper plates used for ML printings through 1928 had become badly worn and Klopfer decided that the ML could not make another printing from them. He asked Harper’s for their “other set [of plates] so we can do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 16 May 1929). Harper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June (Harper & Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later that month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.  \n\nThere are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition to the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b include signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates used for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their charm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm” in 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good morning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after “good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a reader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML informed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.  \n\n#### 126d.

Albert Guerard was invited to write the introduction (ML to Guerard, 30 June 1950), but he declined on the grounds that he had just written an introduction for the competing series Rinehart Editions. The ML then approached Donald Davidson of Vanderbilt University, who initially declined because of other commitments. The ML extended the deadline, and Davidson accepted the assignment. He submitted his introduction in spring 1951 and received the ML’s \\$150 fee. However, *The Return of the Native* never appeared in MLCE, perhaps because of the competing Rinehart edition. Davidson’s introduction does not appear to have been used in any form.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Hardy, *Jude the Obscure* (1927–1990) 145<br> Hardy, *Mayor of Casterbridge* (1917–1971) 17<br> Hardy, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* (1932–1971; 1979–1986) 234  \n\n",

The book of her fortunes and misfortunes, her high misdemeanors and amorous delinquencies, remains today, as it was two hundred years ago, the liveliest and most candid record of a bawd’s progress on the primrose path. The looseness of Moll’s life in folly and wickedness points the moral that the wages of sin need not be punishment and death; sometimes penitence alone redeems the most versatile sinner.

This vivid saga of a beautiful, clever woman, her high misdemeanors and delinquencies, her varied careers as a prostitute, a charming and faithful wife, a thief and convict, remains today the liveliest, most candid record of an eighteenth-century woman’s progress through the hypocritical labyrinth of her society ever recorded. This book, written by Defoe under an assumed name, so his readers would think it an accurate journal of one woman’s life, remains a picaresque novel of astonishing vitality.  \n\nPrinted from the original letterpress plates with Schorer introduction and Author’s Preface omitted.

Some of the page numerals in the headline are particularly battered. The Modern Library reverted to letterpress printing for some volumes in the reissue format (R. D.

(*Fall 1925*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n> Text on front: <br> <span class=\"smallcaps\">Ludwig Lewisohn’s</span> “Up Stream” appeared first in the Spring of 1922. The color and charm of the book and the continuous beauty of its prose established it immediately as an important and permanent contribution to American letters. The Modern Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly win a tremendous new audience for the book. (*Fall 1926*)  \n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too large for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926. *WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1940.  \n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th out of 147 ML titles.  \n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New York, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an introduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like to have your name among the people who have written introductions to our volumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had not liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a ML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925). In the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.  \n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He informed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral and literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not too extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book in such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to Klopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his marriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He removed a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote others. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his fourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for \\$125, Lewisohn wrote:  \n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur. My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML texts).  \n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:  \n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur. Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions within me. . . . \nWe all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . . Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)  \n\nA complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are the following, with the page of the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition given first, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library printing: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171; 146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222; 188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.  \n\nWhen Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of *Up Stream* she threatened to sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage: “Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked Lewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for including the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful nuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will all have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very earliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).  \n\n#### 128b<sub>1</sub>. Second printing, first state (1927)  \n\nTitle as 128a.  \n\nPp.

Why, in my ardent search for the truth of things, did I deliberately falsify *one* element in my life and draw falsely *one* character? Through a mistaken kindliness? Yes.

Text on front: “The original text complete and unabridged, with a prologue by the author.” (*Spring 1929*) *Note:* The Prologue was not new to the ML edition; it had been part of *Up Stream* since its original publication in 1922. The jacket statement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the introduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer included.  \n\nFront flap:n Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. *Up Stream* is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage, outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion. In the literature of America’s coming of age, *Up Stream* occupies a unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final declaration of creative independence. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\nThe fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the ML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation. Lewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised *Up Stream* for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after those that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to Ludwig Lewisohn in 1936 that *Up Stream* continued to sell at the rate of 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time that the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying record” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).  \n\nThree other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. *A Modern Book of Criticism* (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published in spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. *The Story of American Literature* (G43), originally published as *Expression in America*, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to lobby for the inclusion of his novel *The Island Within* shortly after the Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the series were “more than enough” but suggested that *Up Stream* might be dropped and *The Island Within* published in its place. Lewisohn approved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass Canfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939). *The Island Within* (329) sold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>n\\\nLewisohn, ed., *A Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75 \nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43 \nLewisohn, *The Island Within* (1940–1942) 329  \n\n",

(*Fall 1937*)  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n>Text on front: <br> THE AUTHOR: James Joyce is the Irish novelist whose epical satire “ULYSSES” has been hailed as the greatest product of the realistic movement in literature. THE BOOK:  “DUBLINERS” was written in 1905, and the author spent the next seven years trying to make his publisher live up to a contract to bring out the book. For the reader who has never sampled Joyce, “DUBLINERS” is an ideal introduction. (*Fall 1926*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “A book of representative stories by the author of ‘Ulysses,’ hailed as the greatest product of the realistic movement in literature.” (*Fall 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s *Ulysses* after the ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s decision, sustained afterward by the Court of Appeals, lends new importance to the Modern Library edition of *Dubliners*. This collection of short stories is definitely related to Joyce’s later work, in that many of its characters figure in the epical satire, *Ulysses*, and the autobiographical novel, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (Modern Library No. 145). By itself, *Dubliners* is a lasting contribution to the literature of the short story. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published in London by Grant Richards, 1914; published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, using sheets of the first English edition. First American edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, published by Huebsch, April 1917. Huebsch merged with Viking Press in August 1925. ML edition (129.1, pp. [5]–288) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates. Publication announced for 25 November 1926. *WR* 1 January 1927. First printing: 5,000 copies.  \n\nSales of *Dubliners* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 84th out of 147 ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in April 1927 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in July 1928. By April 1950 there had been twenty-eight printings for a total of 60,000 copies (Slocum and Cahoon, p. 17).  \n\n#### 129.1b.

(*Spring 1946*).  \n\n> Front flap revised: <br> The collection of fifteen stories under the title of *Dubliners* was James Joyce’s first published work in prose. Previously he had issued a book of verse, *Chamber Music*. These initial efforts were followed by *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (Modern Library No. 145), the play *Exiles*, the modern epic *Ulysses* (Modern Library Giant G-52) and finally, *Finnegans Wake*. The tales in *Dubliners* are related to Joyce’s later work both in locale and in many of the characters who have a fuller development in *Ulysses*. By themselves these tales, written by Joyce in his early twenties, are a distinguished contribution to the literature of the short story and are an augury of the master work which was to follow.

By themselves they bear the unmistakable stamp of Joyce’s genius and are an augury of the master works which were to follow.n This definitive edition of *Dubliners* is as near as possible to the version Joyce wanted to see published. The text has been prepared by Robert Scholes of the University of Iowa, in consultation with Richard Ellmann, Joyce’s biographer.  \n\nCorrected text originally published by Viking Press, 1967. ML edition (pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published spring 1969 at \\$2.45.  \n\nThe statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text . . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the corrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate dialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition published by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American edition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American printings before 1967—used quotation marks.  \n\nPrintings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½ inch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in 1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼ inch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the taller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely redesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼ inch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch format. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings. The ISBN [394-6012 ](callto:+1394-6012)4-6 (without the initial 0) was added to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets for previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is probably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain endpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were characteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the remainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front endpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as the 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to understand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to the 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger format.  \n\nThere appears to have been a gap of several years between the discontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.  \n\n#### 129.2b.

It is called back to life today because of the insistent determination of a new age to regard Gissing as a stylist second to none, a keen analyst of motives, and an  extraordinary literary figure whose inexplicable hardships stir the imagination of an age surfeited with material things. (*Spring 1927*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The only complete and unabridged edition of this book that exists today”. (*Fall 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> For those who cherish the dream of writing and for those who read and ponder the whole mystery of the anguish and ecstasy of authorship, *New Grub Street* is a book of revelation. Not only does it expose the shifts and subterfuges of meagre talents to provide marketable stuff and the devotion and sacrifice of those who consecrate themselves to the severest of arts, but it lays bare Gissing’s own fierce struggle against vulgarity and the world’s indifference. In that sense, it is a true book of the heart. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nOriginally published in London by Smith, Elder (3 vols., 1891); originally published in U.S. by C. A. Brewster, 1904, using sheets of the second British edition. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1926. *WR* 25 December 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1943; new ML edition published 1985.  \n\nCerf initially asked H. G. Wells to write the introduction. He told Wells that *New Grub Street* was “long out of print in this country, and knowing your enthusiasm for the work, I am wondering whether you will add a short introduction for us.” He offered the ML’s usual \\$50 fee and reminded Wells that *Ann Veronica* continued to sell very well in the series (Cerf to Wells, 13 January 1926). Wells declined, but six years later he wrote an introduction to the fine press edition of *The Time Machine* published by Random House.  \n\nSales of *New Grub Street* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 91st out of 147 ML titles.  \n\nCoustillas (pp. 565–69) provides a detailed inventory of variant bindings and other details of successive ML printings.  \n\n#### 130.1b.

It is the story of Edward Reardon, a novelist whose valiant and painstaking attempts to maintain the standards of his art in the face of severe financial pressure are opposed by an unsympathetic wife. In sharp contrast to Reardon is his friend Jasper Milvain, an essayist who adjusts himself with shocking ease to currently materialistic ideals. A grimly realistic look at the hardships and compromises of the modern literary world, *New Grub Street* is an underground classic.  \n\nBibliographical edition originally published 1962 by Houghton Mifflin Co. in its textbook series Riverside Editions, with an introduction and bibliographical note by Irving Howe. ML edition (pp. [1–2], [5]–425) printed either from Houghton Mifflin letterpress plates or from offset plates made from the Houghton Mifflin edition, with Howe’s introduction and bibliographical note omitted. The Houghton Mifflin edition placed its fly title before the table of contents; when the ML reversed the order it removed the page numeral “4” from the second page of the table of contents.

(*Spring 1932*) *Note:* The part title replaces the fly title used in earlier ML printings, and the verso of the leaf is blank. \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B. \n\n> Text on front:<br> “The Cream of the Jest is in ground plan an attempt to lay bare the secret soul of Felix Kennaston, a successful novelist—not the Bovaryan pseudo-soul visible to his wife and his neighbors, but that esoteric spirit which transcends time and space, and has its adventures in the superworld of the imagination. Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A thing obviously written *con amore* joyously without regard to markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —*H.* *L. Mencken*. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the allegory of *The Cream of the Jest* we discover something of what is in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1917; new bibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with introduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions” (Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. [v]–250), including Ward’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride typesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML printings. Publication announced for January 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940. \n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Cream of the Jest* as early as July 1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s *Jurgen* for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing a “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not want to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an edition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition never appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* the following year. *Jurgen* (271) was not included in the ML until 1934. \n\nThe first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title announced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of the eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print run. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state “*Eighth Printing* | *First Modern Library Edition* | *1927*”.) This might explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first ML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131 variant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s spring lists usually weren’t available as early as November. \n\nIn addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives (which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in August 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930, and printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937, for a total of at least 25,000 copies. \n\nSales of *The Cream of the Jest* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 33rd out of 147 ML titles. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Cabell, *Beyond Life* (1923–1935) 104<br> Cabell, *Jurgen* (1934–1943) 271<br> \n\n",

Cellini’s amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and fascinating books in existence.

His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble, is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the autobiographies of the world. (*Fall 1934*) \n\n*Jacket E:* Pictorial in dark grayish blue (187), light gray (264), medium gray (265), black and gold on coated white paper with inset black-and-white illustration shaded in light and medium gray of a man and woman embracing with Florentine rooftops in background; title and translator in reverse against dark grayish blue background, decorations in gold.

It was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943.

It is, in fact, one of the most important documents of the 16th century. Benvenuto Cellini, an audaciously self-serving Florentine goldsmith, tells of his escapades with the frankness and egoism characteristic of the Renaissance man, describing a life of unequaled grandeur, passion and adventure. It remains today one of the world masterpieces of autobiographical writing. \n\nPublished November 1985 at \\$9.95. ISBN 0-394-60528-4. \n\n",

Generations of readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power of *The Scarlet Letter*. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of life, the story of Hester Phrynne [*sic*] has inevitably become part of our national legacy.

Our present text is that of the second edition, though I suspect that it occasionally backslides” (Stein to Gerber, 6 March 1950). Gerber recommended the text of the third or stereotyped edition published by Ticknor, Reed and Fields in 1850 (Gerber to Stein, 11 April 1950).

Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of the sea at sunrise. \n> The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters, who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads, golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance, *The Purple Land* retains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler. *The Purple Land* is a companion volume in the Modern Library to *Green Mansions* (No. 89.) (*Spring 1934*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton and Co., 1905, using sheets of the second impression of the 1904 English edition; first American edition published by Dutton, 1916, with an introductory note by Theodore Roosevelt (Payne, p. 17). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949. \n\nCerf offered McFee \\$50 to write the introduction to *The* *Purple Land* and also expressed interest in including one of his books, especially *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, in the ML (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). McFee’s *Casuals of the Sea* (223) was published in the ML in 1931. \n\nSales of *The Purple Land* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 67th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was at the bottom of the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. \n\n#### 134b. Title page reset (c. 1941) \n\nTHE | PURPLE | LAND | BY W. H.

In these respects it is a spiritual and intellectual autobiography that proclaims with vigorous emphasis the virtues of strength and pride. The juxtaposition of *Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* in one volume gains significance by opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (*Fall 1933*) \n\nOriginal ML translation. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the four Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as *The Philosophy of Nietzsche* (G32). \n\nAfter discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s *Dawn of Day* with Macmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted *Ecce Homo* instead. They hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England and offered an advance of \\$200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They asked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance that Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive reprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent firm in London but the response was slow in coming. \n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their own translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of Columbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended Horace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss indicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer than they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of his graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of *Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6 December. \n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in mid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with Fadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October 1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but in time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition of *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* was the first time Fadiman’s name was attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 22 May 1943, p. 37). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Nietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (1917–) 9<br> Nietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* (1917–1936) 28<br> Nietzsche, *Genealogy of Morals* (1918–1936) 59<br> Nietzsche, *Philosophy* (Giant, 1937–1970) G32<br> Nietzsche, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1968–) G113<br> \n\n",

Several later printings of 136a are about ¼ inch taller and wider than the standard format. Narrow margins were sometimes unavoidable when the ML printed from other publishers’ plates, but it was unusual for a typesetting designed for the ML to have such narrow margins. It is possible that the size of the type page was determined by an economic decision to limit the volume to fourteen gatherings of sixteen leaves each. \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B. \n\n> Text on front:<br> Mr. Ratner remarks that “after having been one of the liberating thinkers of mankind who was read but not honored, Spinoza is fast becoming one of the canonized of mankind who are honored but not read.” This volume with its Life, Introduction, and Selections will immensely assist to get Spinoza read and understood as well as honored. If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities; and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the extracts from Spinoza’s *Ethics* between selections from his more popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech, etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” —<span class=\"smallcaps\">John Dewey</span>.

John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nRatner was born in 1901 and received his M.A. from Columbia University in 1923. He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy department at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930. \n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6 October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7 June 1927). \n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York, Ratner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s *Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for \\$500. He also retained the unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to \\$700. The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner received no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the contracts at any time within the next two years for \\$1,200 minus royalties accrued from 1 January 1940. \n\n#### 136b.

Jacket title: *An Anthology of Modern American Poetry*. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The vigor and diversity of contemporary American poetry is made strikingly manifest in this anthology. The selections by Conrad Aiken are distinguished for their good taste and the wide range of poetic gifts they reveal. Each of the poets in this volume is generously represented by from a few to a dozen or more poems, an unusual feature in an anthology and one which does greater justice to the whole range of the poet’s work than would the selection of the familiar, isolated poem. (*Spring 1935*) \n\nOriginally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged chronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by Aiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in Aiken’s preface. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nCerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for *Modern American Poets* and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to \\$700 for permissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He urged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the Secker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos Williams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March 1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single poem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of Williams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,” bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S. Eliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six. \n\nAiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that permissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the preface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have been unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr Ezra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously belong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence of Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to the ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of Mr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of these three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2) published in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by Sandburg but none by Masters. \n\nLater in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s poems in the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging of Aiken’s *Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2). \n\n#### 137.1b.

They speak for a half century of growth in America.” (*Fall 1955*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published March 1945. *WR* not found. First printing: 3,000 copies. \n\nAiken suggested revising and modernizing *Modern American Poets* in 1932 (Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until fall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that Aiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound, Archibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated that he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S. Eliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate Maxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also expressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems. However, when *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was in galley proofs Linscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except Eliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken eliminated all but two of his own poems. \n\nWartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles in print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML authors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote that fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod Lib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed serious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our lifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib doesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir? Will we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this year, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow” (Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of his ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be printed when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944). \n\nThe revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared early in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional printings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year, but Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the possibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the year, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your anthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count too heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many demands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary paper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945). \n\n*Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was out of stock for about six months in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken \\$500 against 1947 royalties to help him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken, 6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in stock for the first time since the war” (*PW*, 18 September 1948, p. 1095). \n\n#### 137.3a.

Eighty-one poets are presented, and of these, twenty-three now appear in an anthology for the first time. Mr. Aiken’s awareness of what is relevant, rather than what is merely “modish,” makes this anthology a critical as well as historical record of the growth and major tendencies of American poetry during the first half of this century. (*Spring 1963*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1963. *WR* 22 April 1963. First printing: 10,000 copies. \n\nAiken expressed interest in revising *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* in 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8 February 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960. Epstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at least \\$4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised anthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a third. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new collection, and it would require new permissions fees for *all* the poems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from the 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material (Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962). \n\nAiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there was a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings totaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before 1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp. 109, 120). \n\n#### 137.3b.

A balanced choice from the works of the major poets gives an idea of the range of each; Frost, Eliot, Stevens, and Lowell, among others, are represented by substantial selections, while Mr. Aiken opens a broader view of American poetry through selections from a wide variety of lesser known and newer poets. \n> In all, eighty-one poets are presented, many of them for the first time in an anthology.

It is one of those novels which England has produced that resembles its own immemorial oaks, with roots striking deep into the rich soil – the story of the Brangwens, whose menfolk, sturdy, lusty yeomen, might have had a place beside the knights and squires among the Canterbury Pilgrims. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The fierce ecstasy and sensual violence that pervade the novels of D. H. Lawrence reach their highest and most lyrical note in *The Rainbow*. The sturdy generations of Nottingham Brangwens of whom Lawrence writes are men and women of his own blood, possessed as he was by the hot, fecund urgency of the flesh, and made aware of all the dark and mystical labyrinths of physical love. *The Rainbow* ranks with the most distinguished works of fiction in our language dealing with sex, exalted and unashamed.

His book reaches out to us with singular, doomed power. The terrible conclusion gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of the dawn!” \n> The editors of the Modern Library consider this novel one of the finest in the entire series.

New bibliographical edition published by Thomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by A. & C. Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp. [v], 1–314) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates. Publication announced for April 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1931. \n\nIt is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green Shutters* under the author’s full name rather than his better-known pseudonym George Douglas. \n\nSeltzer described *The House with the Green Shutters* as follows: “. . . this famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern fiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young Scotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first book that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and moods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were equally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926). \n\nBroun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926) but failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in its place was originally written as an article for the British periodical *John O’London’s Weekly* (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never copyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at the last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the ML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the introduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its use. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter of protest to *Saturday Review of Literature* (“A Writer’s Grievance,” *SRL*, 10 September 1927, p. 110). \n\nCerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize *The House with the Green Shutters*, including distributing a portion of the first printing at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it failed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of 8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second printing of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it might catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the end of the year. \n\n",

As much as it was possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly authoritative note. \n> “In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient. (*Spring 1934*) \n\nOriginally published by Roberts Brothers, 1887. New bibliographical edition published by Little, Brown & Co., 1906. Little, Brown edition paginated [i–vii] viii [ix–x] [11–13] 14–203 [204]. ML edition (pp. [*5–6*], [7]–203) printed from Little, Brown plates with page numeral “viii” removed from second page of Hearn’s preface. Published May 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939. \n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 7 cents a copy. Initial sales were good and a second printing of 3,000 copies was made in December 1927. The third and fourth printings for 1,000 copies each were completed in December 1930 and November 1931. \n\n*Some Chinese Ghosts* sold 1,119 copies during the six-month period January–June 1928, placing it ninety-ninth out of 147 ML titles. \n\nThere was a final printing of jacket B in spring 1939 after the ML edition was discontinued.

(*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2. \n\n> Text on front:<br> REMY DE GOURMONT’S somewhat cerebral passions have ample scope in the suave story of the courtship of a presumably innocent young girl by a sophisticated middle-aged man, incorporated in “A Virgin Heart.” Contrary to the accepted notion and to the ideas of the amorous M. Hervart, the modest, gentle, unassuming Rose is surprised at nothing, except the tepidity and reserve of her lover. Abstraction, insinuation and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s limpid and flexibly articulated prose. \n> Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product, almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont. \n> (Remy de Gourmont’s “A Night in the Luxembourg” is volume Number 120 in the Modern Library) (Spring 1927) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*) \n\nHuxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New edition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its acquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by Greenberg. ML edition (pp. [5]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg plates. Published June 1927. *WR* 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933. \n\nEdmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (*Axel’s Castle*, p. 22). \n\nHuxley’s translation of *A Virgin Heart* appeared in the U.S. five years before Allen & Unwin published it in Britain. \n\nThe ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated *A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley declined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh his memory of *A Virgin Heart* and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to Cerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an introduction. \n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year after the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain, noting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our Modern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the spirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this title has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg, 21 October 1927). \n\nThere were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1928 and December 1931. After *A Virgin Heart* was discontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold, most of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June 1933). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br> Gourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926–1932) 125 \n\n",

Like many other good books, it was promptly rejected times without number, but was accepted finally by the London house of Chapman and Hall, on the advice of their reader, George Meredith. \n> The book was an immediate success. It is difficult to imagine that a work so singular in atmosphere, so potent in its passion, should ever have been anything else. To this day, it ranks as the great epic of a South Africa that has ceased to exist—a civilization that heard its sentence of death when gold was discovered on the Ridge of the White Waters. (*Spring* *1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The great epic of a South Africa that has ceased to exist.” (*Spring 1929*) \n\nFront flap:<br> To George Meredith, then a publisher’s reader, belongs the credit for having saved from oblivion a manuscript that has become the spiritual expression of South Africa. Upon its publication in 1879, *The Story of an African Farm* won world-wide acclaim for its author as a writer of genius. The burning passion that illuminates its pages gives conviction to a story unique in the annals of literature. Olive Schreiner was a child of the South Africa that has ceased to exist; her book is its crowning monument and memorial. (*Fall 1933*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Roberts Brothers, 1888, and from 1898 by Little, Brown & Co.

He antedated even Zola. . . . So far in this life, I have encountered no more thoroughgoing cynic than Bierce. Out of the spectacle of life about him he got an unflagging and Gargantuan joy”. —H. L.

(*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> More and more the fame of Ambrose Bierce grows, not so much from his fantastic life and mysterious death, but from his haunting and unforgettable tales. His art is candidly inhuman, yet the clarity and perfection of his style and his dramatic fervor give these “terror tales” a secure place among the classic short stories of literature. The first two stories in this volume— “A Horseman in the Sky” and “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge”—are generally considered Bierce’s best. (*Fall 1935*) \n\nOriginally published as *Tales of Soldiers and Civilians* by E. L. G. Steele, 1891.

Such a storm arose after its publication in 1895 that Hardy swore he would never write another novel. \n> “Jude” is not for the reader who is approaching Hardy for the first time. But to the genuine lover of his writing, it occupies a place all its own, and the pathetic figure of little “Father Time” stands out as one of his most unforgettable creations. \n> (Hardy’s “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Volume No. 17 in the Modern Library, and “The Return of the Native” is volume No. 121) (*Fall 1928*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The last colossus among the Victorians brooded upon humanity’s brave, pathetic struggle for existence and recorded it with a profound but suspended judgment. Obsessed as he was with the intricate and inexorable patterns woven by fate, he hewed out his monumental novels. By common consent, *Jude the Obscure* is his masterpiece. Since its publication in 1895, it has been accorded the world’s admiration and is acknowledged today as one of the most completely unbiased works of fiction in the English language on the complicated questions of sex and instinct. (*Fall 1935*) \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74), deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black of a town street with cottage at left, tree at right and church tower in background; lettering in black and in reverse, all (including wood engraving) against strong yellowish brown background and enclosed in triple-rule frame in deep reddish orange. Signed: Galdone. \n\n> Front flap as jacket B. (*Spring 1938*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1895. ML edition (145.1, pp. [*5*–7], [*10*]–488) printed from a set of 1895 Harper plates with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September 1927. *WR* 5 November 1927. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1990. \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were six additional printings totaling 16,000 copies between 1928 and 1931; printings between 1932 and 1939 totaled 11,000 copies. The ML’s printers damaged the plate for p. 107 sometime between 1929 and 1932; the last three lines of that page are missing in one or more printings from that period. The plate was repaired after Klopfer pointed out the problem (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 13 April 1933; A. W. Rushmore, Harper & Bros., to Klopfer, 17 April 1933). \n\n#### 145.1b.

The Introduction is by Robert C. Slack of Carnegie-Mellon University. \n\nPrinted from offset plates made from a new typesetting, following the text of the second edition (1903). Published November 1967. \n\nSlack comments in the introduction about changes Hardy made between the 1895 first printing and the second edition in 1903. He states: \n\nOne scene in particular had offended many readers; Mrs. Oliphant branded it “more brutal in depravity than anything which the darkest slums could bring forth.” In the second edition of the novel (1903), Hardy quietly toned down this passage, and the alterations he made remained in the definitive text finally approved by the author in 1912. The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference: \n> <br> <center> [1895] </center>\n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude held out his stick with the fragment of pig dangling therefrom, looking elsewhere the while, and faintly colouring. \n> She, too, looked in another direction, and took the piece as though ignorant of what her hand was doing. She hung it temporarily on the rail of the bridge, and then, by a species of mutual curiosity, they both turned, and regarded it. \n> ‘You don’t think I threw it?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘It belongs to father, and he med have been in a taking if had wanted it. He makes it into dubbin.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding the limp object dangling across the handrail of the bridge. \n\n> <br> <center> [1903] </center>  \n> They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him. \n> But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him. \n> ‘You don’t think I would shy things at you?’ \n> ‘O no.’ \n> ‘We are doing this for my father, who doesn’t want anything thrown away.’ \n> <center>. . . </center>\n> They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge. \n> In the revision Hardy has intentionally subdued the piece of pig’s flesh, and the scene of course is weakened. . . .

To lash the age, to ridicule vain pretension, to expose hypocrisy, to deride humbug in education, politics, and religion, are tasks beyond most men’s powers; but occasionally, very occasionally, a bit of genuine satire secures for itself more than a passing nod of recognition. ‘Erewhon,’ I think, is such a satire.” (*Fall 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D.

(*Spring 1933*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> *Erewhon* and *Erewhon Revisited*, considered by many the most important works of their kind produced in the nineteenth century, won a place for their author as one of the great satirists of all time. Samuel Butler has been ranked in the glittering company of Voltaire and Swift, and, like his literary predecessors, he spared neither church nor state, literature or science from the attacks of his sharp wit and ironic commentaries. Underneath his irrepressible, malicious laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and stupidity. (*Spring 1936*) \n\n*Erewhon Revisited* originally published in London, 1901, and in U.S. by E. P. Dutton & Co., 1910. *Erewhon* and *Erewhon* *Revisited* first published together in Everyman’s Library, 1932.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nThe addition of *Erewhon Revisited* was part of an effort in the early 1930s to make ML books a better value in the Depression book market. In 1932 the ML combined Maupassant’s *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories* (8) and *Love and Other Stories* (72) into a single volume, *The Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* (243). Wilde’s *Poems* (19) and *Fairy Tales and Poems in Prose* (58) were combined as *The Poems and Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde* (242). Wilde’s two volumes of plays, *Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan* (76) and *An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance* (77) were combined as *The Plays of Oscar Wilde* (241). \n\n#### 146c.

(*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Upon the completion of his *Principia Mathematica*, in collaboration with Dr. Whitehead, Bertrand Russell reached the conclusion that little could be achieved by writings addressed exclusively to specialists. Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness. These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (*Spring 1936*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1927. *WR* 22 October 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nShortly after publication of *The Philosophy of William James* (119) Cerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to have declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife to the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed to select the contents and secure permissions from the original publishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond writing the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of the editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff: \n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him, however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!” (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926) \n\nKomroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He went on: \n\n> I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark to [*sic*] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured. The whole sceme [*sic*] was my idea in the first place and it would have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam [*sic*] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926). \n\n#### 147b.

The storm that broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends. John Haynes Holmes’ introduction appears exclusively in the Modern Library edition of this book. (*Fall 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s *Life of Jesus* was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the beginnings of the Christian era. (*Spring 1937*) \n\nThe ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was originally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML edition (pp. [*5*–*7*], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with Hutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. [*5*] reset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction. Published December 1927. *WR* 7 January 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. \n\nTwo other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. *The Life of Jesus* was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton, 1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation by the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd French edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations, was published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little, Brown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on economic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have required royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public domain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson translation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying royalties and the cost of resetting the text. \n\nKlopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The Renan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore” (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library; published in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p. 87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as “Renoir”). The bad plates continued to be used into the 1960s. \n\nHolmes, minister of the Community Church in New York City, received \\$50 for the introduction. \n\n#### 149b.

He showed that life, even in fiction, might be stripped of the enameled exterior of cultural standards and refinements, and the substratum of animality that cannot die be portrayed in its true light.” (*Fall 1927*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket C*: Three French Romances gift box.

Signed: Newman.  \n\n>Front flap:\nBanned in England in 1888 for its so-called obscenity, *Nana* has since come to be regarded the highest achievement among the novels of the Naturalist school. Its author is now acknowledged as the source from which the English realists and our own Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser derive their greatest influence. Regardless of the sensational aspects of this work and its niche in literary history, *Nana* lives as a novel by its own vigor and the incomparable skill and fidelity with which it is written. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\nPlarr translation originally published in a limited edition by the Lutetian Society (London, 1894) and in U.S. by Boni & Liveright, 1924. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published January 1928. *WR* 18 February 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nThe Modern Library used the Victor Plarr translation without identifying the translator. When a film version produced by Samuel Goldwyn and starring the Russian actress Anna Sten was released in 1934, the ML urged booksellers to stock *Nana* in quantity and distributed copies of the movie poster to major bookstores.  \n\nSales of *Nana* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 2nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was low in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales.

For the next time a fit of boredom or weariness assails you, a dose of d’Artagnan and his three musketeers—Porthos, Athos, and Aramis—is confidently prescribed. (*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1929*)  \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in vivid red (11) and black on cream paper depicting four swords held aloft with a plumed hat perched on one of the swords; lettering in black, borders in vivid red. Signed: Staloff. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:\nHowever much the industry of Alexandre Dumas is held up as an example of literature in its first manifestations of mass production, *The Three Musketeers* still throbs with undiminished pulse for the modern reader. Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos [*sic*] and Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan, there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first and final perfection.

Despite the fact that *Leonardo da Vinci* has been heretofore available only in very expensive editions in America, its popularity has increased each year. Mr. Guerney’s new and complete translation for the Modern Library brings within the reach of many new thousands of readers the best biography of what was probably the most versatile genius in all history.

(*Fall 1931*) Later printings in dark purplish gray (234) with front flap:  \n\n> The insatiable spirit and the unparalleled genius of Leonardo Da [*sic*] Vinci give radiance to this biographical romance. The heroic grandeur of Leonardo’s achievements in art and science, the fecundity of his mind and the illimitable reaches of his imagination are revealed against the glowing background of the Renaissance. Kings and popes and courtiers, artists and philosophers and poets throng the scene. Dominating them all is Leonardo in a portrait that might have been wrought by one of his own contemporaries. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginal ML translation. Published 1 March 1928. *WR* 17 March 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nPublication was originally announced for November 1927 on the basis of Guerney’s promise of a finished manuscript by the beginning of September. The translation took longer than expected; the ML did not receive final installment until 13 January 1928 (Cerf to Ronald Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 14 January 1928).  \n\n*The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* sold 12,264 copies during the first six months of 1928, making it the ML’s best-selling title. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\nThe ML edition sold nearly 76,000 copies during its first five years with annual sales as follows: 23,651 copies (1928); 20,933 copies (1929); 14,447 copies (1930); 9,404 copies (1931); and 7,334 copies (1932) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). It was the ML’s best-selling title during the first half of 1928, with sales of 12,264 copies. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it sold 4,736 copies, placing it in the third quarter of ML sales.  \n\n#### 154b.

Superseded 1949 by a revised edition edited by Howard Haycraft (424).  \n\nFour years after the publication of *Fourteen Great Detective Stories* Starrett suggested a volume of crook stories as a companion volume (Starrett to Cerf, 17 October 1932). Nothing came of this idea.  \n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories* was the ML’s tenth best-selling title during the first six months of 1928. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales.  \n\nStarrett declined an invitation in 1946 to revise *Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, citing lack of time, the “wildly inadequate” fee, and his lack of sympathy with the hard-boiled genre which he believed should be represented (Starrett to Harry E.

(*Fall 1931*)  \n\n>Front flap:\nThe publication by Random House of James Joyce’s *Ulysses*, after the ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s epoch-making decision, lends importance to the Modern Library edition of *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*. This earlier autobiographical novel is a prelude to *Ulysses*, and it makes clear the method and the scope of the latter work. As the first novel to employ the stream of consciousness technique, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* created a revolution in modern fiction. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginally published in book form by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, and from 1925 by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [*1*]–299) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title. Published March 1928. *WR* 7 April 1928. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.  \n\n*A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* was the ML’s thirteenth best-selling title during the first six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was at the bottom of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It slipped into the second quarter of ML titles during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 but sold 1,200 more copies on an annual basis than it had in 1942–43. There were thirty-eight ML printings by May 1950 for a total of 99,000 copies (Slocum and Cahoon, pp. 18–19).  \n\nViking Press published *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in its quality paperback series, Compass Books, in August 1956. Viking Press appears to have canceled the ML’s reprint contract in anticipation of the Compass edition and allowed the ML to sell out its existing stock.  \n\n#### 156b.

(*Spring 1928*) *Note:* *First* statement retained on printing with fall 1928 list.  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n>Text on front:\nIt was the production of “The Emperor Jones” in 1920 that put the final seal on Eugene O’Neill’s acceptance as one of America’s most important dramatists. \nThe play is a story of a fear-crazed negro, told to the accompaniment of a rhythmical drumbeat which starts at a normal pulse and is slowly intensified until the heartbeat of the reader corresponds to the frenzied beat of the drums.\n“The Straw” was written in 1918—immediately preceding the composition of “The Emperor Jones.” (*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Alternative pictorial jacket on pale blue (185) paper with inset illustration in black of a bare-chested black man making his way through jungle foliage; lettering in black without horizontal borders and rules. Signed: Davidson. (*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*1930*)  \n\n*Jacket D:* Pictorial in strong orange (50) and black on yellow paper with inset illustration of a bare-chested black man making his way through jungle foliage; lettering in black, borders in strong orange. Signed: Davidson. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n>Front flap:\nDiversity of form and content, an unswerving artistic integrity and an ever-renewing imaginative strength have given Eugene O’Neill his unchallenged place among the first dramatists of the world. Even if his reputation did not draw sustenance from his other published works, his pre-eminence would be assured by *The Emperor Jones* alone. It is a *tour de force* of heart-pounding relentlessness that strips naked the terror-stricken soul of a Negro. *The Straw* reveals another facet of Eugene O’Neill’s many-sided genius. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\n*The Emperor Jones* and *The Straw* originally published by Boni & Liveright, 1921, in a volume with O’Neill’s *Diff’rent*. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for April 1928. *WR* 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937. Superseded February 1937 by *The Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape* (299).  \n\nDudley Nichols of the *New York World* wrote the introduction after O’Neill declined to write it himself (Cerf to O’Neill, 7 December 1927; Cerf to Nichols, 7 February 1928).  \n\nO’Neill made several revisions in the text of *The Emperor Jones* when he prepared it for *The Complete Works of Eugene O’Neill* (2 vols., Boni & Liveright, 1924). The most notable were the cutting of speeches by Smithers at the end of Scene One and the end of the play. In the revised version Scene One ends as follows:  \n\n><span class=\"smallcaps\">Smithers </span>[*Looks after him with a puzzled admiration*]: ’E’s got ’is bloomin’ nerve with ’im, s’elp me. [*Then angrily*.] Ho—the bleedin’ nigger—puttin’ on ’is bloody airs! I ’opes they naps ’im an’ gives ’im an’ gives ’im what’s what!  \n\nThe original version continues:  \n\n>[*Then putting business before the pleasure of this thought, looking around him with cupidity.*] A bloke ought to find a ’ole lot in this palace that’d go for a bit of cash. Let’s take a look, ’Arry, me lad. [*He starts for the doorway on right as* \n> <center> [*The curtain falls*] </center> \n\nThe revised version of the play ends with Lem’s dialogue: “Gawd blimey, but yer died in the ’eighth o’ style, any’ow!” The original version continues:  \n\n>[<span class=\"smallcaps\">Lem</span> *makes a motion to the soldiers to carry the body out left*. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Smithers</span> speaks to him sneeringly.] \n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Smithers</span>—And I s’pose you think it’s yer bleedin’ charms and yer silly beatin’ the drum that made ’im run in a circle when ’e’d lost ’imself, don’t yer? [*But* <span class=\"smallcaps\">Lem</span> *makes no reply, does not seem to hear the question, walks out left after his men*. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Smithers</span> *looks after him with contemptuous scorn.*] Stupid as ’ogs, the lot of ’em. Blarsted niggers! \n> <center> [*Curtain falls*] </center> \n\n\nThe Modern Library used the original version of *The Emperor Jones* in some collections and the revised version in others. *The Emperor Jones; The Straw* was probably set in type from *The Emperor Jones, Diff’rent, The Straw* (Boni & Liveright, 1921) and uses the original version. *The Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape* (399), which superseded *The Emperor Jones; The Straw* in the ML in 1937, also follows the original text. The 1972 Vintage Books edition of *The Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape*, which superseded the Modern Library edition and is printed from plates made from a new typesetting, uses the original text. The original version also appears in *Six Modern American Plays* (441).  \n\nIn contrast, O’Neill’s *Nine Plays* (G53), published in 1941 as a ML Giant and printed from plates originally used by Liveright, Inc. in 1932 and later by Random House, has the revised version of *The Emperor Jones*. The revised version also appears in the 3-volume *Plays of Eugene O’Neill* (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition was originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951 when *The Iceman Cometh* was added.  \n\n*The Emperor Jones; The Straw*, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928. Sales through 1932 were as follows: 5,855 copies (1928); 2,901 copies (1929); 1,921 copies (1930); 1,405 copies (1931); 756 copies (1932) (Cerf to O’Neill, 2 June 1933).  \n\nThe ML paid royalties to Boni & Liveright of 10 cents a copy.  \n\nO’Neill became a Random House author after the Liveright bankruptcy in 1933. Saxe Commins, his editor at Liveright, also moved to Random House. In choosing between Coward-McCann and Random House, O’Neill wrote:  \n\n>Cerf . . . has drive and enthusiasm, coupled with keen shrewdness. Moreover, I felt Coward was trade publisher, pure and simple—but Cerf has more to his publishing than that, a love of beautiful books, an appreciation for good literature, an ambition to keep his firm above the level of the others, to expand only along lines of distinction. That, of course, appealed strongly to me. As for background for my stuff, there is no comparison. . . . Cerf has two unique things—Modern Library and Random House.  \n\nHe also thought Random House would offer better opportunities for Commins:  \n\n>I feel strongly that Cerf is the better bet for your present and future . . . with him, you will have a real chance to do your stuff and a most congenial atmosphere. . . . With Cerf you’ll undoubtedly be called upon to contribute real imagination and judgment of real writing, once you’ve fitted in there (O’Neill to Commins, June 1933; in Commins, ed., *“Love and Admiration and Respect”*, pp. 159-60).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nO’Neill, *Moon of the Caribbees and Six Other Plays of the Sea* (1923–1940) 101  \nO’Neill, *Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape* (1937–1971) 299  \nO’Neill, *Long Voyage Home* (1940–1971) 101e  \nO’Neill, *Nine Plays* (Giant, 1941– ) G53  \nO’Neill, *Ah, Wilderness! and Two Other Plays* (1964–1973) 559  \nO’Neill, *Plays of Eugene O’Neill*, 3 vols.

(*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n>Text on front:\nAlthough the first part of “Tristram Shandy” appeared as long ago as 1760, the editors of the Modern Library feel that they need offer no explanation for its inclusion in a series of latterday classics. Could any writing be more modern in spirit than Laurence Sterne’s—more singularly frank and unconventional? Toby Shandy is a character that will remain universally lovable and admirable for all time. (*1928)*  \n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front as jacket A. (*Spring 1929*)  \n\n>Front flap:\nA world deprived of the joyous and audacious spirit of *Tristram Shandy* would be unthinkable. For two centuries Laurence Sterne’s irrepressible book has served as an unfailing antidote for dullness and pomposity. Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety. Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete and unabridged version. (*Spring 1934)*  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for April 1928. *WR* 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nThe leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is traditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its inclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R.  H. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury the ML abandoned after the first printing.  \n\nThe omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of *Tristam Shandy* traditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There is no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there is a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the book by it . . .” (p. 281).  \n\n*Tristram Shandy* was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the first six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 158.1b.

Here are simply a dozen sketches of character—rotund, brilliantly colored, absolutely alive. The thing is done capitally, and, at its top points, superbly. *H. L. Mencken* \nIn all these portraits there is that same sincere attempt to present the men as they are—the modern Heliogabalus, and the modern ascetic, the section boss, and the village patriarch. Here is wondrous, inscrutable, fascinating life as revealed in the diversity of twelve marionettes of the Great Impressario [*sic*]. It is one of the most unusual books in our literature, and certainly one of the best books that Dreiser has given us. *Burton Rascoe* (*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1919. ML edition (pp. [*1*]–360) printed from B&L plates with contents page omitted. Publication announced for June 1928. *WR* 4 August 1928. First (and only) printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1934.  \n\nCerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the rights to *Twelve Men*. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of \\$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October 1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for royalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&L for the use of their plates. B&L received \\$200 for approving the ML reprint; this appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was deducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received \\$1,000 when the contract was signed.  \n\nDreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the *New York Sun* (13 April 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken \\$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but Mencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis to write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked *Twelve Men* very much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf to Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928). Charles Merz of the *New York World* also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9 February 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou of the *Chicago Daily News*, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought to be doing this himself” (p. v).  \n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *Twelve Men* ranked 34th among the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of 1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales fell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser file) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies (1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421 copies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).  \n\nSeveral years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that *Twelve Men* was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers, Simon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability to furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep my works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me without a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at least, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf explained why *Twelve Men* had been discontinued and added, “I believe that one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained popular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles each year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit, thereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their keeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to Dreiser, 10 April 1939).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nDreiser, *Free and Other Stories* (1924–1931) 106  \nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932–1971) 230  \nDreiser, *American Tragedy* (Giant, 1956–1968) G89  \n\n",

When, in 1912, Gerhart  Hauptmann, then fifty years of age, was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, it was “principally for his rich, versatile and prominent  activity in the realm of the drama.” To a world which knows Hauptmann by his “The Sunken Bell,” there is no more convenient way of  introducing a work of his which yet is not so widely known as by saying that “The Heretic of Soana” is to Gerhart Hauptmann’s prose  fiction what “The Sunken Bell” is to his poetical dramas. (*Spring  1928; Fall 1928*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1923, whose firm merged with Viking Press in 1925. ML edition (pp. [3]–192) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates with the Huebsch half title used as a fly title. Published July 1928. *WR* 4 August 1928. First (and probably only) printing: 6,000 copies.

Viking Press pointed out the oversight, and Klopfer promised to add Morgan’s name to the next printing (Klopfer to Viking Press, 23 July 1930). However, *The Heretic of Soana* sold poorly, and there does not appear to have been a second printing. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder marking of a star stamped on the endpaper.  \n\n",

The editors feel that they can show their appreciation of the support accorded the entire series by booklovers of America in no more appropriate way than by publishing these reproductions of Whistler’s beautiful art, with an understanding biography by Elizabeth Robins Pennell, at the regular Modern Library price. (*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. \n\n>Text on front: <br> “32 Reproductions in the Aquatone Process | With an understanding biography by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Elizabeth Robins Pennell</span>”. (*Spring 1929*)  \n\nOriginal ML publication. Text and illustrations printed by the “aquatone process.” Published August 1928. *WR* 8 September 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1936.  \n\nThe ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of the title page states: “*Printed by the* <span class=\"smallcaps\">aquatone process</span> *by* | *Edward Stern &Company, Inc.*”  \n\nThere were at least two printings of *The Art of Whistler*. The statement “*First Modern Library Edition* | 1928” appears to have been retained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition” statement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first printing; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such statements on all printings.  \n\nThe ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’ previous biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97). *The Life of James McNeill Whistler* by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and Joseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B. Lippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911. Joseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to edit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the manuscript on her own.  \n\nKlopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the manuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss to determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the author. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her home in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his mid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer struggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs. Pennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the manuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November 1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).  \n\nShortly after publication of *The Art of Whistler* Klopfer invited Mrs. Pennell to edit a companion volume, *The Art of Joseph Pennell* (Klopfer to Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.  \n\nKlopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain before he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of *The Art of Whistler* in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn near our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we don’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane, 11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s *Lives of the Twelve Caesars* (217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no illustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.  \n\n#### ***Fall***  \n\n",

Against the weariness  of a forbidding morality and the rumbling pretences of its pious  advocates, there is always the wholehearted ribaldry and rollicking  laughter of Rabelais. His gigantic nonsense and his gay and lecherous  love of life give his books the stature and vitality of his own  heroes. The Modern Library version, condensed by Professor Donald  Douglas, is as faithful in spirit as it is intelligent in its  selectiveness. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginal ML abridgment of the Urquhart-Motteux translation. Published September 1928. *WR* 13 October 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1945 following the publication of *The* *Complete Works* *of Rabelais* (G66).  \n\nThe ML commissioned Douglas to prepare an abridged edition of Rabelais. The manuscript was due in May 1927, but Douglas’s work on it was held up by a succession of bouts with influenza. There were other problems as well. In one letter he told Cerf, “I had worked about six hours a day for a week on Rabelais . . . and then you told me the whole thing must be expurgated” (Douglas to Cerf, 6 October 1927). When he finally submitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever did in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).  \n\nDouglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse Rabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells would say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the immense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth or turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of stones. By the laws of our own age it has become necessary and obligatory” (pp. ix–x). Douglas’s edition was superseded in 1944 by *The* *Complete Works* *of Rabelais* (G66) in an unabridged translation by Jacques Le Clercq.  \n\n*Gargantua and Pantagruel* ranked in the middle of the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942-1943.  \n\nThe ML plates were used by Walter J.

(*Fall 1928*)  \n\n>Front flap:<br>  The mighty corridors of heaven and the mean and fashionable streets of  Paris provide the scenes for Anatole France’s most fabulous satire.  Angels and mortals, seraphim and syndicalists, demiurges and trollops  mingle in love and in the daily pursuits of life. This novel,  recounting the visitation to earth of the messengers of God and Satan,  reveals Anatole France at his impious best as the subtle ironist and  the resourceful historian of disillusion. *The Revolt of the Angels*  is one of five Anatole France titles in the Modern Library. (*Spring  1934*)  \n\nTranslation by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson originally published in U.S. by John Lane, 1914, and from 1922 by Dodd, Mead & Co. ML edition (pp. [1–4], 7–348) printed from a duplicate set of Lane/Dodd, Mead plates with running heads removed and original page numerals in the headline replaced by smaller numerals placed closer to the text. Published September 1928. *WR* 13 October 1928. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939.  \n\nThe Dodd, Mead trade edition of *The Revolt of the Angels* was an attractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page (text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins. The Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid typesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a typepage that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard trim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem. [scan of Dodd, Mead ed. w ML Jacket Scans file]  \n\nIn the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by photographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the type page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The quality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were higher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an option in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were developed in the early part of the century, but it was not until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book printing industry. The method would have had more use in its early days had it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not well enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked lithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2nd ed., p. 136).  \n\nThe Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals were part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page numerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the first line of text, and they were set in a different font that was smaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals. Margins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was ⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted to the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The result was one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced.  \n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* sold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter. The ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of 17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings of 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly before the final printing. Subsequent sales were as follows: 366 copies(July–December 1936); 344 copies (1937); 319 copies (1938); and 256 copies (January–June 1939, after the ML edition was officially discontinued). The figures for July 1936–June 1939 include the resale of copies returned by booksellers; sales subject to royalty payments during this period totaled 753 copies.  \n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* was discontinued in 1938 because of declining sales, shortly before the ML introduced a new and larger format designed by Joseph Blumenthal that could have accommodated the Dodd, Mead plates more comfortably.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nFrance, *The Red Lily* (1917–1937) 7  \nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (1917–1942) 21  \nFrance, *Queen Pédauque* (1923–1933) 100  \nFrance, *Thaïs* (1924–1938) 109  \nFrance, *Penguin Island* (1933–1970; 1984– ) 253  \n\n",

The continuing popularity of his work, however,  rests not on his influence on other thinkers of his time or on the  logical strength of his metaphysics, but on his resonant prose, and  the accessibility to the nonacademic reader of what Irwin Edman calls,  in his introduction, a “philosophy in the old and appealing meaning of  the wisdom of life. . . . the alert, half-sad, half-cynical harvest of  a candid eye.”  \n\nThis volume contains Schopenhauer’s major work, *The World as Will and Idea*, as well as the essay, “The Metaphysics of the Love of the Sexes.”  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nSchopenhauer, *Studies in Pessimism* (1917–1934) 12  \n\n",

The most popular of his books, it stands alone as a unique recreation of what was actually  Proust’s own childhood. Swann, the focal character, is the son of a stockbroker and has entered into an “unfortunate” marriage. Marcel, the narrator, remembers that his family’s guests during the early period of his life were practically limited to Swann, who, like the  other people in Marcel’s early memories, seemed to him to be “abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree.”   If I think of it,” says Marcel at the end of *Remembrance of Things Past*, “the substance of my experience came to me through Swann.”  \n\nPublished fall 1977 at \\$5.95.

(*Fall 1928*)  \n\n>Front flap:<br>  Virginia Woolf’s vibrant sensitiveness to the casual, her unerring  susceptibility to impressions and the firm texture of her prose combine to make *Mrs. Dalloway* a novel of distinction and absorbing interest. The events of the single day on which Clarissa Dalloway prepares for a party become a pageant of London. By means of technique both delicate and sure, a vivid chronicle of men and women of diverse character unfolds itself, revealing a cross-section of English life compressed into the flow of a few hours.

ML edition (pp. 3–296) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published December 1928. *WR* 12 January 1929. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued fall 1949.  \n\nML sales of *Mrs. Dalloway* totaled 61,000 copies (Kirkpatrick, *Virginia Woolf*, p. 26). *Mrs. Dalloway* sold 4,271 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. *To the Lighthouse* (306) was in the fourth quarter during this period with sales of 3,203 copies.  \n\nLewis Miller, the RH sales manager, reviewed the jacket design that Angelo originally submitted and asked for revisions: “Would you try to do the lettering for the title in a little simpler fashion to increase visibility. Also the pinkish lettering against the white is perhaps not strong enough. Could I recommend that you think in terms of a darker ink for the lettering?” (Miller to Angelo, 15 March 1939).  \n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning postwar college market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *Mrs. Dalloway*, *To the Lighthouse*, and seven other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 1,400 copies of *Mrs. Dalloway* in stock. Klopfer estimated that it would take six months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948).  \n\n#### 168b.

With this conviction in mind, he could eliminate some of the stand-bys of older anthologies and make place for the refreshing and vital work of the poets who have arisen in the quarter of a century between the two world wars. This anthology offers the work of the best American poets from the time of the Revolution to the present day. (*Spring 1945*) *Note:* \n\n> Front flap reset in sans serif type from the flap text of 169.1a. It is not known if the reversion to the earlier text was deliberate or accidental. (*Fall 1953*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* As 169.1b on coated white paper with dark purplish red (259) replacing dark gray and strong purplish red (255) replacing dark brown. \n\n> Front flap as 169.1a. (*Fall 1964*)  \n\nPublished February 1945. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1978/79. *Note:* The copyright date is 1944, but publication of *A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry* appears to have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper shortages.  \n\n*A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* also comprised the American portion of the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s insistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra Pound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was later returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf ignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve omitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been “overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include a single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was focused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any suggestion of purging Pound from *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* or *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (137.2), both of which were published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s poems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the 1947 printing (see G68).  \n\nSince the regular ML edition of *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from different type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two formats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of the two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of the Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books are printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point size. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the headline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type pages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the Giant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page, but there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the regular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries, indexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular edition and 420 pages in the Giant.  \n\n*American Poetry 1671*–*1928* and *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American poet. These and other African American poets had been represented in *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183), edited by V. F. Calverton and published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s anthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* appeared in 1945. The revised edition of *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (372), edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and 1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies” edited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice M. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of Calverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have occurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets from his anthology.  \n\n#### 169.2b.

Publication scheduled for January 1929. *WR* 23 February 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1935.  \n\nCerf invited Will Durant to write an introduction to *Salammbô* after Durant’s publishers, Richard L. Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster, told him that Durant was an enthusiastic admirer of the work. Durant insisted on a fee of \\$100, twice what the ML usually paid, and then submitted a general essay on Flaubert. Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to me much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much too much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo. And what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story” (Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to Durant, 10 September 1928). Durant indicated that he didn’t have time to make changes, and the ML published *Salammbô* without an introduction.  \n\nFour years after *Salammbô* was discontinued, James T. Farrell suggested Flaubert’s *Sentimental* *Education* for the ML (Farrell to Cerf, 1 February 1939). Cerf responded, “I am sorry to say that I see little point in adding another Flaubert title to the Modern Library at this time. We had to drop out both SALAMMBO and THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY  because of complete lack of demand, and even MADAME BOVARY doesn’t sell one-quarter of what it did ten and fifteen years ago” (Cerf to Farrell, 2 February 1939).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nFlaubert, *Madame Bovary* (1917– ) 25  \nFlaubert, *Temptation of St. Anthony* (1921–1933) 82  \n\n",

Copies of the first printing are also found in balloon cloth binding with Kent’s grapevine design on the spine, his torchbearer in gold on the front panel, and the title and author on the spine stamped from lettering drawn by hand rather than set from metal type. There is also an intermediate stage between binding A and binding B1 which incorporates all elements of Kent’s design except hand lettering on the spine. Later printings appeared in balloon cloth bindings B2, with Kent’s torchbearer blind stamped on the front panel. The ML appears to have rejected Kent’s recommendation to employ letterers to create title and author statements for the binding spines of subsequent titles.  \n\n> *Variant A:* Pp.

Signed: Hynd. (*Spring 1929*) *Note:* The ML experimented with several pictorial jackets in 1929 in connection with three boxed sets of three titles each that were intended for sale as Christmas gifts. The boxed sets, which were sold primarily in department stores, were *Three Great French Romances*, *Three Great Renaissance Romances*, and *Three Great Modern Novels*. Hynd’s jackets for the volumes in the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box—Butler’s *Way of All Flesh* (13.1d jacket B) and Hardy’s *Return of the Native* (126b jacket B) in addition to *The Brothers Karamazov*—were exceptional examples of expressionist graphics. They were never adapted for use on regular ML printings.  \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial jacket in dark red (16) and black on light gray paper with inset drawing of the three Karamazov brothers standing against a red background; lettering in black, borders in dark red. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> Friedrich Nietzsche paid Fyodor Dostoyevsky the supreme compliment of acknowledging him his teacher, for he learned from the Russian that even a great criminal could be a great man. Dostoyevsky’s understanding of every exaltation and humiliation of the human spirit, his profound tenderness and compassion, his intensity and psychological clairvoyance are nowhere so completely realized as in *The Brothers Karamazov*. Here the mystic and the realist at last come into accord and give to the world this crowning achievement of Dostoyevsky’s tormented and almost fabulous life. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nGarnett translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1912. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1929. *WR* 23 March 1929. First printing: 20,000. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nKlopfer inquired about the possibility of printing the ML edition from Macmillan plates but was informed that the Macmillan Co. in New York used printed sheets imported from England (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 31 October 1928; Harold S. Latham, Macmillan, to Klopfer, 9 November 1928). Cerf and Klopfer decided to assume the cost of original composition and announced that the ML edition was the first to be printed in the United States. Other publishers, they noted, “always imported it from England rather than undergo the great expense of making a new set of plates for so lengthy a book” (ML circular, RH box 133, Advertising 1929 folder 2). At 988 pages *The Brothers Karamazov* was longest book the ML had published up to that time.  \n\n*The Brothers Karamazov* sold about 30,000 copies in its first two-and-a-half years in the ML (Cerf to Robert Linscott, 9 October 1931). It ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. In the early 1950s (November 1951–October 1952) it was the twelfth best-selling title in the ML; the Giant edition (G34) ranked in the second quarter of ML titles.  \n\n*The Brothers Karamazov* was one of four works to be published in the regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included in all three series were Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (1930: 197), Giant (1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Fielding, *History of Tom Jones* (1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943: IML 5); and Whitman, *Poems* (1921: 94.1), title changed to *Leaves of Grass* (1929), *Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose* (1951: 440); *Leaves of Grass* (Giant,1940: G48), Illus ML (1944: IML )  \n\n#### 171.1b.

To understand the origins and manifestations of the psychoses that afflict us, we must come to a better comprehension of the biological and social factors involved. This handbook gives an all–inclusive view of the interrelationship of mental diseases to the forces in modern life which cause them. Here eminent authorities speak in non–technical terms for the layman, that he may better understand the causes and consequences of a maladjusted mental equipment. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published February 1929. *WR* 23 March 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded fall 1954 by revised edition (172.2).  \n\nCerf asked Everett Dean Martin of the New School for Social Research in 1926 if there was any chance of including his book *Psychology: What It Has to Teach You about Yourself and Your World* (W. W. Norton, 1924) in the ML. If not, he asked whether Martin would be interested in compiling an anthology on psychology as a companion to *An Outline of Psychoanalysis* (108). Martin replied negatively to both (Cerf to Martin, 21 September 1926; Martin to Cerf, 28 September 1926).  \n\nCerf turned next to Gardner Murphy, who received royalties of 5 cents a copy.  \n\n*An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* sold 1,634 copies during the first six months of 1930 and 1,113 copies during the first six months of the following year. It ranked low in the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during 1951–52.  \n\n#### 172.1b.

In the study of the range of human variability lies a key to sympathetic understanding of those who suffer the tragedy of a sick, disturbed mind. In such study, too, lies a key to a greater capacity to understand one’s own emotional and social growth and thus to cope more skillfully with the endless problems, crises, and frustrations of everyday living. In this book, eminent authorities, using non-technical language, introduce the layman to the scope and the new horizons of abnormal psychology. (*Fall 1954*)  \n\nRevised edition published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nMurphy wrote Cerf in 1953 that a revision of *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* was badly needed. He indicated that he had recently reviewed the selections in the 1929 edition and that in almost every instance it would be possible to select a superior example to represent current research and practice. He noted that he would need a collaborator who was familiar with fields in which he was not up-to-date (Murphy to Cerf, 14 January 1953).  \n\nStein replied four months later that the ML was planning revisions of several titles, including *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology*. He suggested that Murphy engage a collaborator for a flat fee of \\$300, which would be paid as an advance against Murphy’s royalties, and indicated that the ML would pay up to \\$300 for permissions. The royalty rate was to remain at 5 cents a copy (Stein to Murphy, 15 May 1953). Murphy thought that \\$500 should be the minimum fee for a collaborator but believed that permissions would be less than \\$300. Stein agreed to the \\$500 collaborator’s fee and reduced the permissions budget to \\$200 (Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953; Stein to Murphy, 29 May 1953). Murphy selected Bachrach as his collaborator. Bachrach made the preliminary selection of contents, and Murphy wrote a new introduction. The revised edition contained completely new material.  \n\nThe American Institute of Graphic Arts selected *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* as one of the fifty best books of 1954 (*Fifty Books of the Year 1954: Catalog of the Thirty-third Annual Exhibition* [New York: American Institute of Graphic Arts, 1955], p. 34).

(*Spring 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> Who can withhold a tear for Cyrano de Bergerac as he hides his preposterous nose in the darkness and lets his lyric utterances win the fair Roxane for the handsome but mute Christian de Neuvillette? Who has not been moved to pity by the romantic posturings of the unerring swordsman, this understudy knight of chivalry and ghost-writing maker of sonorous ballades? All the fine bravura of Edmond Rostand’s swaggering drama, all its poetical extravagance and glamor are here in Brian Hooker’s famous translation. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nHooker translation originally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1923. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March 1929. *WR* 27 April 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.  \n\nThe Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the text and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of 10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new plates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first 30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a \\$3,400 advance in December 1928 against royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.  \n\nIn 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of *Cyrano de Bergerac* at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the president of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed concern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but he acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely putting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your mind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at high schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have proposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on your own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18 June 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).  \n\n*Cyrano de Bergerac* ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth best-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose Ferrer.  \n\n#### 174.1b.

(*Spring 1956*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except strong purplish red (255) instead of vivid reddish orange. (*Spring 1963*)  \n\nJacques Le Clercq, whose translations of Rabelais’s *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (G66) and Dumas’s *Three Musketeers* (153.2) were published in the ML in 1944 and 1950, indicated in 1953 that he was working a rhymed verse translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac* and inquired if the ML would be interested in it. He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is superb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though a perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was inherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider changing the translation, which had “established itself as standard for many college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953; Commins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton University Library). Le Clercq’s translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac* does not appear to have been published.  \n\nBy 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML edition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep *Cyrano* in the series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt accept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new plates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time Holt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C. Edwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May 1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the mid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.  \n\n",

Jackets A and B were superseded by jacket C in fall 1931.  \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in grayish purple (228) and black on light purplish gray paper with inset illustration as jacket B; lettering in black, borders in grayish purple. (*Fall 1931*  \n\n> Front flap: <br> The sensational success of *The Bridge of San Luis Rey* obscured for a time the fine lustre of Thornton Wilder’s earlier work, *The Cabala*. But critics and an enthusiastic minority of readers clung to their preference for the calm and suave classicism of the Italian tale in the Henry James tradition. The restraint and the mystical implications of *The Cabala*, the imaginative subtlety with which it is endowed, the firmness of its characterizations, its wit and irony, give it a place of eminence among contemporary novels. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginally published by Albert & Charles Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp. [iii], [3]–230) printed from Boni plates. The heading of the contents page of Boni printings was changed from *The Cabala* to *Contents* at some point between the sixth printing (January 1928) and the tenth printing (August 1928); ML printings use the second version of the contents page. Published April 1929. *WR* 11 May 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1937.  \n\nCerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know that you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote, “particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an introduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to send it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is going to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford to buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be made up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words stating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in this edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered \\$100, double the ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the last moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him \\$50 for an introduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March 1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the end of March.  \n\n*The Cabala* sold well during its first two or three years in the series. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and another printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in the RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933.  \n\n",

He became one of the chosen circle of Nero’s intimates, and was looked upon as an absolute authority on questions of taste in connection with the science of luxurious living.” This estimate of Petronius Arbiter by Tacitus completely characterizes the author of *The Satyricon* as the cultivated and depraved apotheosis of his uninhibited age. (*Fall 1936*)  \n\nAbbey Classics edition with Scott Moncrieff introduction originally published in U.S. by Small, Maynard & Co., 1923, using sheets of the English edition. ML edition (pp. v–238) follows the text of the Abbey Classics edition with the substitution of modern typesetting conventions for Burnaby’s 17th-century practice of capitalizing nouns within sentences. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for May 1929. *WR* 13 July 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.  \n\n*The Satyricon* was written during the reign of Nero. The Burnaby translation, originally published in 1694, was the first in English. Burnaby included supplements to the text, later shown to be spurious, that had been “discovered” in 1688. The first page of the ML text is headed: THE SATYRICON | OF PETRONIUS | *THE SATYR OF* | *TITUS PETRONIUS ARBITER* | *With its Fragments, recover’d at Buda, 1688*. (p. 1).  \n\nThe ML edition sold 2,015 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it one of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles. It did not rank among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952  \n\n#### 176b.

(*Spring 1929*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> From the time Honoré de Balzac pronounced Stendhal’s preeminence among the novelists of France until today, the author of *The Red and the Black* has retained and spread his influence among writers of every nationality. His story of Julien Sorel is incomparably the most astute and penetrating study of middle-class mores in all fiction. It is, in addition, a relentless dissection of the hypocrisy and opportunism of as unconscionable an upstart as ever violated the Seventh and other Commandments in order to get on in the world. (*Spring 1933*)  \n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Boni & Liveright, 1926. ML edition (pp. v–[288]; v–[352]) printed from B&L plates. Published June 1929. *WR* 13 July 1929. First printing: 4,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissue format, 1984.  \n\nThe ML hyphenates the translator’s name as Scott-Moncrieff on the 177a title page and omits the hyphen in 177b‑e. Boni & Liveright was also inconsistent in its multi-volume *Works of Stendhal*, hyphenating the translator’s name on the title page of *The Red and the Black* and omitting the hyphen on the title page of *The Charterhouse of Parma* and the jackets of both works.  \n\nThe ML paid Liveright royalties of 10 cents a copy.  \n\n*The Red and the Black* ranked high in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It rose to the first quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. The dramatic increase in sales may reflect use of *The Red and the Black* in college literature courses after the Second World War, when enrollments increased dramatically as large numbers of veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill to earn college degrees.  \n\n#### 177b. Title page reset (c. 1941)  \n\nTHE RED | AND | THE BLACK | BY MARIE-HENRI BEYLE | (DE STENDHAL) | TRANSLATED BY | C. K.

It is the story of Julien Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois mores and French society, *The Red and the Black* established Stendhal as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.  \n\nPublished fall 1984 at \\$9.95.

Through the masks of tragedy and comedy, nobility and villainy, and all the duality of the human spirit, the life of man glows to passion and grows dim. Pity and terror in Æschylus, serene detachment in Sophocles, burning fervor for justice in Euripides and the robust intellectual comedy of Aristophanes—these qualities remain the message and the meaning of Greek drama. It is a heritage from antiquity that the modern spirit needs. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Publication announced for July 1929. *WR* 14 September 1929. First printing: Not ascertained.

Here, too, are the caustic turns of speech, the sardonic wit and the acute powers of observation that have made Smollett’s books a plunder house for English writers during almost two centuries. And here, above all, is Smollett in a genial and mellow mood, but candid and outspoken, with the healthy frankness of the eighteenth century. (*Fall 1936*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published August 1929. *WR* 14 September 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nCerf wanted to include a volume of Machen’s stories in the ML and proposed the idea to him when he visited London in summer 1926. *The Hill of Dreams* and *The House of Souls* were in the U.S. public domain, but Machen, who badly needed the money a ML edition would bring, felt he could approve the proposal only if Alfred A. Knopf, his American publisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached Knopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He told Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an introduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered \\$100, twice the ML’s usual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf to Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that *Humphry Clinker*, “the work of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he thought that *Roderick Random* was “more characteristically Smollett: rough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin with. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with his order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April 1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he wrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.  \n\n*Humphry Clinker* ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 179b.

(*Fall 1947*)  \n\n> Front flap revised:  <br> The rogues’ gallery of ruffians and lusty wenches that gave so much color to *Roderick Random* and *Peregrine Pickle* is matched by an array of cantankerous characters in *Humphry Clinker*. Here, in the last of his novels as in the others, are the wit and wisdom, the acute powers of observation, and the sharp turn of phrase that characterize all of Tobias Smollett’s work. Here is Smollett, grown tolerant of human frailty after having screamed against it in *Roderick Random*, now writing in the mellow, satiric vein of amiable elderly people in whom there is a hard core of eccentricity. *Humphry Clinker*, now almost two hundred years old, still retains the freshness and the vigor of the best of the eighteenth-century novels.

(*Fall 1929*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> To classify *The Dance of Life* as a book of philosophy, as a spiritual autobiography or even as a book of personal affirmations does it scant justice. It is all of these and more. It is a book of aspiration, of growth and of revelation, written by a man who has partaken of life and contributed to its wisdom, grace and idealism. *The Dance of Life* may be considered the crowning achievement of Havelock Ellis’s life; it epitomizes his spirit and his work. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1923. ML edition printed from Houghton Mifflin plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1929. *WR* 26 October 1929. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.  \n\nIn addition to the ML printing, the new plates were used for 1929 printings in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library and the Book League of America. A revised index keyed to the new typesetting appears in ML and Book League of America printings but not the Riverside Library printing, which ends on p. 342, the last page of text. The Book League of America contents page lists the index while the ML’s doesn’t. Ellis’s new foreword is unique to ML printings.  \n\nThe ML paid Houghton Mifflin an undetermined advance against royalties on the first 50,000 copies. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1931; printings reached 50,000 copies by October 1945.  \n\n*The Dance of Life* ranked in the 3rd quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943.

Her life was consecrated to love. As it was with Shulamite, who inspired Solomon’s Song of Songs, so love had set a seal upon Lilly’s heart. All the denials of poverty, the violences of lechery and the longings of her own dream world only made her more desirable in the eyes of men. Hermann Sudermann’s novel of a woman who walked in sin is a romance in the cause of love beyond purity. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nSeltzer translation originally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1909, and after 1925 by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [3]–640) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title. Published October 1929. *WR* 23 November 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1942.  \n\nML printings do not identify the translator. Huebsch and Viking printings attribute the translation to Thomas Seltzer, but it was actually by his wife Adele Seltzer, who wanted to publicize her husband’s name. Thomas Seltzer’s contribution was typing the manuscript that was submitted to Huebsch (Levin, *Dare to Be Different*, pp. 85, 269).  \n\nThe ML paid Viking royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were three additional printings of 2,000 copies each between April 1930 and April 1931 and five known printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1932 and April 1941.  \n\nSudermann’s novel was read more widely in the early decades of the 20th century than it is today. Jackets of early ML printings of *Madame Bovary* (25.1) state on the front panel: “Today there are two more novels that are likely to be classed with [*Madame Bovary*] . . .

First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1944 by a revised edition edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins (372).  \n\nWhen W. C. Handy authorized the inclusion of five blues he had copyrighted, he stipulated that copyright notices were to be printed on the same pages as the lyrics. Calverton acknowledged Handy generously in the preface but neglected to include the individual copyright notices. Handy or his representative contacted the ML shortly after publication, insisting that the agreement be honored. Klopfer contacted the ML’s legal counsel about the matter (Klopfer to Edwin A. Falk, 27 November 1929). He subsequently wrote to H. Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders, informing them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected sheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s truckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s stock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,” he stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly printed” (Klopfer to Miss J. A. Lanning, H. Wolff Estate, 26 December 1929). The corrected state of the first printing is described under 183a<sub>2</sub>. \n\nCalverton’s *Anthology of American Negro Literature* sold 3,243 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it near the top of the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.  \n\nCalverton’s anthology was superseded in 1944 by a new edition edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins (372). Watkins omitted poetry and other material.  \n\n",

They are drawn from life, and indeed, many of them appear under their own names.” (*Fall 1929*)  \n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–247) printed from Knopf plates. Published November 1929. *WR* 21 December 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.  \n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s midwestern sales representative, suggested the inclusion of *Peter Whiffle* (Crowder to Cerf, 21 December 1928). At this time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering resentment over the ML edition of *Green Mansions* (90). However, Cerf had become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying to put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928). Relations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929 luncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *Peter Whiffle*. He also offered to pay Van Vechten \\$100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an introduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated that he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van Vechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf turned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929). *Peter Whiffle* was the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the ML.  \n\nThere was a second printing of 1,000 copies in August 1932.  \n\n",

The manuscript which has come down to us from the eighteenth century in various condensations has delighted those readers who cultivate an interest in accounts of forbidden pleasures.

(*Fall 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:\nOf the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none is in greater favor than Homer’s *Iliad* and its companion volume, *The Odyssey* (No. 167). The immortal epic of the wrath of Achilles and the siege of Troy is as vivid to the contemporary reader as it must have been to Homer’s first enraptured listeners seven centuries before the Christian era, and as it has remained through the ages in its various renderings. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation was chosen upon the urgent advice of the leading authorities in England and America. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nLang-Leaf-Myers translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1883. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1929. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded fall 1964 by Rees translation (186.2).  \n\nThe ML originally planned to use the 17th-century translations of George Chapman for its editions of Homer’s *Iliad* and *Odyssey*. Advance advertising referred to the Chapman translations, as did fall 1929 catalogs and ML lists—including the lists inside first printings of the Homer jackets. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *The Iliad* and the Butcher and Lang translation of *The Odyssey* were substituted at the last moment on the advice of several college professors. “We discovered that we could sell five times as many books in the new translation as we could have had we used the Chapman, since the Lang, Leaf, and Myers one is used in almost all of the colleges” (Cerf to George M. McKanday, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 25 November 1930).  \n\nThe Prefatory Note (p. [*5*]) indicates that Books I–IX were translated by Leaf, X–XVI by Lang, and XVII–XXIV by Myers, but that the whole was revised by all three translators.  \n\nThe ML hoped to use Macmillan plates, but Macmillan had to secure approval from its parent firm in London and was unable to make a solid offer until the end of October. By that time the ML had begun composition so that the books could be published in December.  \n\n*The Iliad* ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and rose into the lower part of the first quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.

(*Spring 1957*)  \n\nHighet received \\$300 for his introductions to *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey* (Stein to Highet, 26 January 1950). The first section of the introductions (“The World of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*”) is common to both volumes, as is the bibliography. Highet’s introductions were also included in printings of *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey* in Modern Library College Editions, which were introduced in fall 1950. Most of the introductions written for MLCE appeared first in that series and were subsequently added to regular ML printings.  \n\nThe Prefatory Note and the poems on pp. [*6*] and [465] of 186.1a–b are omitted from 186.1c.  \n\nMyers’s name was misspelled on the reset title page. Highet pointed out the error shortly after publication (Highet to Crary, 8 September 1950). There is a memo in the RH Papers ordering the correction on the MLCE title page.

Richmond Lattimore’s verse translation of *The Odyssey* did not appear until 1967, sixteen years after his translation of *The Iliad*. The Lattimore translation probably would not have been available to the ML in any case. Rees’s verse translation of *The Iliad* was published in 1963 and was added to the ML the following year (see 186.2).

Even so, Cerf thought that the anthology contained “glaring defects” and acknowledged, “Copyright difficulties . . . prevented our putting into this volume exactly what we would have liked to include” (Cerf to A. E.

Signed: Wuyts. (*Spring 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> For sheer terror, for the spectral power to fasten itself upon the imagination, stirring and tormenting it, *The Turn of the Screw* is the apotheosis of the macabre in literature. Without abatement, it arouses the senses and numbs them, clutches at the heart and makes it beat faster, while it unfolds one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. *The Lesson of the Master* portrays the inevitable penalties imposed on those who cherish a dream of perfection. It reveals Henry James as an incomparable story-teller and stylist. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginally published by the Macmillan Co., 1898 (*The Turn of the Screw*) and 1892 (*The Lesson of the Master*). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for January 1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nThe ML’s original intent was to publish *The Turn of the Screw* only, to print from Macmillan plates, and to pay a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy (H. C. Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26 November 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to write an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March 1929).  \n\nFinal publication plans took shape in January 1930, when Macmillan granted permission to add *The Lesson of the Master* for an additional payment of \\$100 (Latham to ML, 10 January 1930). Broun’s introduction, dated January 1930, makes no reference to *The Lesson of the Master*. The ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed publication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both works entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying royalties of 2 cents a copy.  \n\n*The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* ranked in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943, just below *The Portrait of a Lady* (291). James’s sales improved significantly by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 *The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* sold 3,734 copies, making it seventy-fourth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML. James’s *Portrait of a Lady* sold 5,345 copies, placing it thirty-ninth.  \n\n#### 189b.

Signed: Wuyts. (*Spring 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> Instead of beginning his career as a writer of promise, Ernest Hemingway startled the world, and especially his own generation, with *The Sun Also Rises*, his first full-length novel. The disinherited and disillusioned survivors of the World War discovered in him their spokesman, a writer free of sentimentality and cant who could summon forth characters true to their own experience and way of life. *The Sun Also Rises* is a chronicle of a lost generation drifting, frustrated and demoralized, to its doom. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition (pp. [xi]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.  \n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a \\$6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as 1927, when he offered a \\$1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New York Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was pleased that *The Sun Also Rises* was to appear in the series. But he declined Cerf’s offer of \\$200 to write an introduction—four times what F. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML edition of *The Great Gatsby*—explaining that he couldn’t write an introduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to write it would be taking \\$200 out of some critics [*sic*] pocket—but beside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to Cerf, 4 January 1930).  \n\nPrintings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930), 5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies (December 1934). *The Sun Also Rises* was the eighteenth best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales. It sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.  \n\nCuriously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition of *The Sun Also Rises*, despite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and Unabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being Jewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he learned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the third paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the richest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter XVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).  \n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *The Sun Also Rises* would be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr., Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a \\$3.00 hardbound reprint in April 1953 and a \\$1.45 paperback in August 1957.  \n\n#### 190b.

As a man, he represents the best of nineteenth-century humanitarianism and a generous Christian morality. As a writer, he towers above all the literary figures of his time, and his two great novels—*War and Peace* (Modern Library Giant G-1) and *Anna Karenina*—are universally acclaimed as classics. Anna of the latter novel is considered the most notable character in the vast gallery of the great and obscure people who live in the pages of his works. The translation from the Russian by Constance Garnett is complete and unabridged. (*Fall 1952*)  \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Several authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat accepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale University. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed, “Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of Anna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs. Karenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28 January 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that were corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to extend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek was willing, but instead of the ML’s \\$200 fee he wanted a \\$500 advance against a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart for his introduction to Gogol’s *Dead Souls*. Stein indicated that \\$200 was all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to Stein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon College and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell University, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an introduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in any case his fee would be \\$500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March 1950).  \nTroyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s \\$200 fee (Troyat to Stein, 24 March 1950).

(*Spring 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> A bright constellation of artists, dilettantes and voluptuaries made Bohemian New York a haven for the practitioners of all the deadly sins. Into their midst came Easter Brandès with her operatic ambitions and luminous beauty. A great Isolde, she had the morals of a soprano and the heart of a pawnbroker. *Painted Veils* is the story of her career as a singing harlot in a modern Babylon. It is told with the irrepressible mirth and flavor of that shrewd and ever-fascinating promenader among the seven arts— James Huneker. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1920. New bibliographical edition published by Horace Liveright, 1928. ML edition (pp. [5]–310) printed from 1928 Liveright plates with pp. [5] and [9] transposed. Published March 1930. *WR* 12 April 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1942.  \n\nThe ML paid Liveright a \\$5,000 advance. *Painted Veils* was the ML’s best-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190) and Merejkowski’s *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154). It continued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty best-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in September 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML printings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.  \n\nShortly after *Painted Veils* was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith, the editor-in-chief of Boni & Liveright, suggested a ML edition of Huneker’s autobiography *Steeplejack* (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930). Cerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you really think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no question that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to Smith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles Scribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker titles it published, such as *Essays*, selected and introduced by H. L. Mencken (1929) or *Steeplejack*. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s glory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern Library (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936). The ML edition of *Painted Veils* was discontinued six years later.  \n\n#### 192b.

For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp and poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding, these plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Tchekov world famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most revered.

Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file).

(*Spring 1930*)  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)  \n\nOriginally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1922. ML edition (195.1a<sub>1</sub>, pp. [iii]–vii, 14–336) printed from corrected Holt plates with the introduction (pp. 1–13) omitted; 195.1a<sub>2</sub> and subsequent printings of 195.1 are printed from the same plates and include the introduction. Published April 1930. *WR* not found. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.  \n\nCerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an advance of \\$560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot Holt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a college text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E. Holt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when Herschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a reorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince the new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John Dewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a copy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first payment of \\$750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that over for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13 February 1928).  \n\nBy 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told Cerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an introduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of \\$100 and suggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to *The Dance of Life* (1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to write the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey to Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to the ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense. Dewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library Edition” since *Human Nature and Conduct* already included a preface and an introduction by Dewey.  \n\nSomeone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his introduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was paginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part of the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the mistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the last page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on its verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing. In its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8 leaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all remaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first printing. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of the contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and the first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of the second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected copies became the first state of the first printing.  \n\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine printings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies.

Designed by Warren Chappell; unsigned.  \n\n> Front flap: <br> This translation by Samuel Putnam—which has been greeted as a literary event of the first magnitude—captures for the first time in English the glory and the humor, the meaning and the feeling of the original. *Don Quixote*, the first modern novel, has for three and a half centuries maintained its place in the affections of every generation of readers. Its appeal is universal and inexhaustible—it has been called “the Bible of Humility” by the renowned French critic Saint-Beuve. \nThe Samuel Putnam translation is now available, complete and unabridged, in this handsomely printed one–volume edition, with a critical text based upon the first editions of 1605 and 1615, and with variant readings, variorum notes, and an Introduction by the translator.  \n\nPutnam translation originally published in two volumes by Viking Press, 1949. ML edition (pp. [v]–1043) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published fall 1964. *WR* 2 November 1964. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nThe Putnam translation replaced Ozell’s revision of the Peter Motteux translation in MLG in spring 1965. The offset plates for the Giant are also photographically reduced from the Viking edition, but the larger format of the Giant made possible a smaller reduction and resulted in a far more readable book.

(*Fall 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> The history of W. Somerset Maugham’s masterpiece is a significant commentary on the changing and maturing taste in fiction. When it appeared in 1915, a few discerning critics hailed it as one of the first important novels of the twentieth century. For several years the public remained apathetic and the book almost suffered the fate of the casual novel. But its loyal champions fought to save it from oblivion. Today, no more popular novel exists in the English language. It has been one of the two best sellers in the entire Modern Library series for the last three years. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except on coated light yellow (86) paper. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1915, and from 1927 by Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–766) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1930. *WR* 18 October 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four long-sought Doubleday titles—*Of Human Bondage*, Walpole’s *Fortitude* (201), Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203), and Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale* (207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a \\$6,000 advance for *Of Human Bondage* and agreed to pay royalties of 12 cents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was then paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men* (159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January 1931. Doubleday’s new plates *Of Human Bondage* were originally intended for the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden City Publishing Co. around 1933.  \n\nIn April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent of the list price, which was then \\$2.45. Royalties on the Vintage paperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a \\$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the total was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of \\$10,000 due on1 January 1969 and 1 January 1970.  \n\nIn 1968 the ML considered transferring *Of Human Bondage* to the Giants series, which would have involved photographing the book and making new plates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.  \n\n*Of Human Bondage* was one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It ranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication date, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in 1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as follows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and 11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not calendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been sold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 *Of Human Bondage* sold 18,505 copies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the fourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more copies than Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228), then the second best-selling title in the regular series. By the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s best-selling title with sales of 11,563 copies.  \n\n#### 199.1b.

(*Fall 1957*)  \n\nThe plates for *Of Human Bondage* and Maugham’s *Moon and Sixpence* (283) were becoming worn by 1944 and Haas decided to make new plates for both titles. Freiman contacted Doubleday, Doran to determine whether it was willing to supply new plates or at least pay part of the cost (Freiman memo to Haas, 13 November 1944). Doubleday, Doran agreed to reset and make new plates for both titles at its own expense as long as the ML agreed to keep them in print and promote them aggressively for at least ten years (Cedric R. Crowell, Doubleday, Doran, to Commins, 2 January 1945). The new plates were delivered to the ML’s printers in December 1945. The ML instructed Parkway Printing Co. to dispose of the old plates and use the new ones for all future printings (Regina Spirito to Bill Simon, Parkway Printing, 13 December 1945).  \n\n#### 199.3a.

Its description of the impact of the British public school system on the growth of an individual is still a definitive one. The torment of a young man involved in an obsessive and destructive love is delineated with compassion and insight, making this one of the most intelligent and important statements on the process of self-discovery. Maugham’s gift as a storyteller has never been more clearly demonstrated.  \n\nIn April 1968, when the list price was \\$2.45, the ML increased the royalty rate from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent of the list price. The new reprint contract also called for a 15 percent royalty on the Vintage paperback edition and a \\$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. Even with the higher royalty *Of Human Bondage* remained a profitable title for the ML (John J. Simon, memo to Tony Wimpfeimer, 14 May 1968).  \n\n#### 199.3b.

For a century and a quarter it has held its place among the world’s treasures. The variety and beauty of its plan and the depth of its implications give it the immortality for which its central character bargained with his soul. Faust remains the personification of humanity, tempted and tormented, groping toward the light. Of the fifty translations of the masterpiece, Bayard Taylor’s, in the original metres, most completely retains Goethe’s intention and spirit.

The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf told the press agent Lynn Farnol that Walpole received the highest advance against royalties that the ML had ever paid (Cerf to Farnol, 14 May 1941), but the amount was not indicated—and of course the advance would have been paid to Doubleday, Doran, which would have split it with Walpole.  \n\nCerf was unhappy with the appearance of the first printing. The plates, he told Doubleday, “are lousy, and we need some new ones” (Cerf to Robert de Graff, Garden City Pub. Co., 5 November 1930). When he sent a copy of the first printing to Walpole he apologized for its appearance and indicated that Doubleday had promised to supply new plates for subsequent printings (Cerf to Walpole, 26 November 1930).  \n\n*Fortitude* was in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943.

The absorbing interest of its romantic story, its enthusiasm and its conviction make of it a rare phenomenon among books in an epoch of uncompromising realism. That it is Mr. Walpole’s favorite among all his novels can be readily understood. He says of it: “*Fortitude* is a romance—a fairy-tale about a young man who very naively believed in almost everything.” (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nPrinted from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. The plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. First printing from the new plates: 5,000 copies.  \n\nAll subsequent ML printings were from the new plates.

No evidence of a printing in Star Dollar Books or any other Doubleday imprint has been found.  \n\nCharles Boni used the ML plates in 1930 for a single printing of *The Medici* in the format the ML would adopt the following year for the new ML Giants series. Later that year Cerf and Klopfer bought the remaining stock from A. & C. Boni and sold it along with a printing of *The Education of Henry Adams* that they had produced in a similar format. The books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”  \n\nAn illustrated edition of *The Medici* (G8), printed from plates of the regular ML edition, was published in ML Giants, 1933–49.  \n\n*The Medici* was one of several titles that were omitted from a comprehensive ranking of ML sales for the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. The regular ML edition sold 3,300 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales.  \n\n#### 202b.

They are modern in their promiscuities and in the refinements of their virtues and their vices; they are always reckless in their spiritual and carnal experiences. *Point Counter Point* is in the staccato tempo of our time, a colorful symphony, full of extravagant and fascinating tonalities, shrewd commentaries and graceful embellishments. It is, above all, a sophisticated novel for a sophisticated age. (*Fall 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1928. ML edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting that appears to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published November 1930. *WR* 29 November 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1967.  \n\n*Point Counter Point* was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML secured reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Most ML royalties were based on the number of copies printed; the royalties for *Point Counter Point* were based on sales.  \n\nThere was a second printing of 5,000 copies in August 1931 and a third printing of 4,000 copies in November 1932. *Point Counter Point* was low in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. Sales improved significantly by the early 1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 *Point Counter Point* was the 27th best-selling title in the ML.  \n\nIn 1939 Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and the publishing rights to Huxley’s older books to Harper & Bros. Cerf expressed the hope that *Point Counter Point* and *Antic Hay* could remain in the ML “for a long time to come” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939). Harper’s considered publishing the titles in full-priced editions at \\$2.50 and was concerned about the income it could expect from the ML editions. Unless the income was substantial, Hoyns indicated, the ML editions “might turn out to be a very unprofitable arrangement from our point of view” (Hoyns to Klopfer, 17 March 1939).  \n\nKlopfer and Hoyns met over lunch to discuss the matter. Shortly before the meeting Klopfer wrote directly to Huxley, who was a personal friend: “Help, help, Harper’s are threatening to take POINT COUNTER POINT and ANTIC HAY away from us. These two books belong in the Modern Library and it would be a crime not to have them available in a cheaper edition. . . . Could you influence the Harper office in any way in our favor? I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can make a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a strong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive reprint, rather than just in the \\$2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to Huxley, 20 March 1939).  \n\nKlopfer’s appeal appears to have been successful. Following the lunch Klopfer sent Hoyns new five-year contracts for the books. The *Point Counter Point* contract called for the ML to pay a \\$1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least 5,000 copies after three years.  \n\nIn 1965 Harper & Row gave six months’ notice that the ML contract was being terminated so that *Point Counter Point* could be included in its own hardbound series, Perennial Classics (Virginia Olson, Harper & Row, to Epstein, 23 July 1965). The ML was allowed to sell out its stock on hand, which consisted of 4,400 copies (Epstein to Olson, 9 August 1965). The ML edition was out of stock by summer 1967.  \n\n#### 203b.

The poetic charm and the dramatic suggestiveness of his writings lend persuasion to Plato’s central theme—the clarification and harmonizing of life by reason. Under the brilliant editorship of Irwin Edman, the Modern Library edition of *The Philosophy of Plato*, in the Jewett Translation, is the most comprehensive collection of Plato’s works issued in a single volume. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in strong yellowish pink 26), silver and black on coated cream paper with drawing of Plato on inset silver circle and lettering in black, all on panel in strong yellowish pink with borders in silver.

(*Spring 1939*)  \n\nEdman’s edition of *The Works of Plato* was originally published by Simon and Schuster, 1928. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1930. *WR* 29 November 1930. First printing: Not ascertained.  \n\nEdman’s selection included ten dialogues from the third edition of *The Dialogues of Plato*, translated into English with introductions and analyses by B. Jowett (5 vols., Oxford University Press, 1892). Edman omitted Jowett’s lengthy introductions and analyses, but the Simon and Schuster edition retains Jowett’s marginal notes. Fourteen dialogues were omitted. Simon and Schuster used the word “abridged” on the title page; the ML title page, which indicates that the volume was “selected and edited” by Edman, was clearer and more accurate.  \n\nThe Simon and Schuster plates were too wide for the ML’s format. The ML reset the entire work, omitting the marginal notes. The ML paid Simon and Schuster royalties of 7 cents a copy, of which Edman appears to have received 5 cents.  \n\n*The Works of Plato* sold 10,848 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the 26th best-selling title in the ML. Sales were even better in the early 1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s eighth best-selling title.  \n\n#### 204b.

The ‘philosophy’ of Plato is clearly not a philosophy of the schools; his drama is profounder in theme and more comprehensive in range than the constricted little toys of the stage. For those who have not learned with Plato that philosophy is the love of wisdom rather than the pronouncement of truth, there is considerable mystification in a thinker whose thoughts are all suggestions, whose suggestions are often playful, and who will not, despite the attempt of more than one serious critic, be crammed into a neat and lifeless system. The reader is haunted, too, by the perturbed sense that, though these dialogues are full of endless charm as poetic and ironic drama, they are clearly more than the by-play of a gifted writer. The further one reads the more deeply does one come into the presence of the profoundest and most serious issues of human existence. What on its winning surface is the spirited conversation between Socrates and a group of attractive young Athenian aristocrats, closely read, stirs one profoundly to a consideration of the nature of good and evil, of reality, of the paramount mystery of the human soul.” —*from the Introduction by Irwin Edman*  \n\n#### 204d.

Designed by Kent; unsigned. (*Fall 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap:  <br> More than a record of an adventure in solitude, *Wilderness* is a book that re-creates the wonder and the tranquillity of an untracked world. The hand and heart and mind of a distinguished artist combine, in prose and pictures, to convey the topography and the moods, the changing vistas and the dramatic silences of the sub-Arctic region. Rockwell Kent’s text, embellished by more than fifty pictures from his pen, has the excitement of a quest that attains the nearest paradise man can hope for on earth. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1920, in a volume measuring approximately 11½ x 8 in. (280 x 200 mm). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the original introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second Preface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. [v] of the Putnam edition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in the volume. Published December 1930. *WR* 27 December 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.  \n\nThe Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The announcement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition, Rockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important revisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations that appear in the six dollar edition” (*PW* 118, 16 August 1930, p. 574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored “two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in the fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently would not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go so quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear under the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:  \n\n<center>“Guter Mond, du gehst so stille </center>\n<center> Durch die Abend Wolken hin.” </center>\n\n\nThe ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s smaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the Putnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by about a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all of the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the title page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam binding.  \n\nThe ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to Angus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized \\$1.49 reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was planning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not consulted about the \\$1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of the ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Kent bought 240 copies of the discontinued ML edition at twenty-five cents each (Kent to Cerf, 8 June 1939).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nMelville, *Moby Dick*, illus.

This chronicle of the Five Towns and France during the Siege of Paris is a project of heroic proportions, accomplished with infinite skill, and of a scope that invites comparison with the greatest novels of the Victorian era. It is a tale of ordinary people during extraordinary times, told with an insight encountered only in the works of the masters of fiction. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Hodder & Stoughton, 1909. New bibliographical edition with preface by Bennett published by George H. Doran Co., 1911, and subsequently by Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting that Doubleday, Doran appears to have made for the ML’s exclusive use. Published January 1931. *WR* 14 February 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1972.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four long-sought Doubleday titles—Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage* (199), Walpole’s *Fortitude* (201), and Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML had exclusive reprint rights to *The Old Wives’ Tale* and paid Doubleday, Doran a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of 3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in 1933. Cerf stated in 1946 that *The Old Wives’ Tale* “remains, year in and year out, one of the most popular novels in the Modern Library” (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *SRL* 29, 24 August 1946, p. 18).  \n\n*The Old Wives’ Tale* was the third best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,816 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter ML and Giant titles.

Then, with few predecessors, Fielding created his own form and brought forth a pioneer work of English fiction. Now, with countless imitators, his book is read with the kind of appreciation one reserves for a novel that understands the ageless frailties of mankind and forgives them. A book that makes pretensions ridiculous and shows tolerance for weakness is ageless. *Tom Jones* is remembered with affection by readers of every variety for its complete naturalness and for its vivid characters. After two centuries the permanence of Henry Fielding’s novel is assured.

Unforgettable characters and episodes emerge in its pages: Tom himself—loving, high-spirited, brimming with impetuous vigor; irascible Squire Western with his dogs and drink; Sophia Western, who sees through sham with a gentle “Fie!,” and marvelously understands how to manage her prickly father; Mr. Allworthy, seeker of justice, blinded by his own good heart; Square the philosopher; Mr. Thwackum the divine; the black Blifil; and the author himself, permeating every page with kindly admonitions, scorn of hypocrisy, and admiration of the true virtue found in clarity of vision and a prudent disciplining of the spontaneous urgings of one’s own good nature. Picaresque novel, comic mock epic in prose, *Tom Jones* ranks in the forefront of world literature.  \n\n#### 208.3.

A foundling, Tom, is discovered one morning by Squire Allworthy and his squarish sister Bridget and brought up as a son in their household until it is time for him to leave and seek not only his fortune but his real identity. Athletic, charismatic, generous, filled with what Fielding called “the glorious lust of doing good” but with a tendency toward dissolution, Tom Jones is one of the first characters in fiction ever to display legitimate sides of good and evil. *Tom Jones*, the novel is one of the first examples of the “novel of incident,” one which develops character along with plot, and a crucial influence upon the development of modern fiction.  \n\nBowers edition originally published in two volumes by Wesleyan University Press, 1975, and reprinted in one volume. ML edition (pp. [3]–982) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition with the following material omitted: dedication (“To Ruthe”), table of contents, list of plates, preface signed by Battestin and Bowers, Battestin’s introduction, fly title (a reproduction of the title page of the 1749 edition), and all appendices (chronology of important dates, select bibliography, index to the corrections, abbreviations used in the notes). The illustrations by Warren Chappell (color plates and line drawings) and the color map on the endpapers are also omitted, as is the list of plates. Published spring 1985 at \\$10.95. ISBN 0-394-60519-5.  \n\n*The History of Tom Jones* (208.3) is in the 8¼ x 5½ inch format formerly used for ML Giants.  \n\nLines 3–4 of the title page are doubly flawed: Battestin’s introduction is not included in the ML edition, and Battestin’s name is misspelled.  \n\nThe full-page color and black-and-white illustrations by Warren Chappell in the one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition were originally created for the Illustrated Modern Library edition of *The History of Tom Jones* (IML 5, 1943). Chappell’s black-and-white vignettes at the head of the dedication, each of the eighteen books, and the end of the Illustrated Modern Library edition are omitted; in their place the Wesleyan University Press substitutes two flourishes and a swelled rule at the head of the introduction, a swelled rule and fluerons below the heading for each book, and a drawing of a couple walking arm-in-arm at the end of the text. All of these illustrations are omitted from the ML edition, which otherwise is a photographic reproduction of pp. [3]–982 of Wesleyan University Press edition, printed by offset lithography with the type page photographically reduced in size.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nFielding, *Joseph Andrews* (1939–1971) 323  \nFielding, *History of Tom Jones* (Giant, 1940–1951) G52; Illustrated ML (1943–1947) IML 5  \n\n",

(*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> For more than five centuries Giovanni Boccaccio’s *The Decameron* has stood virtually unchallenged in its supremacy as the world’s greatest collection of tales. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Keats and many other literary immortals found in these Florentine stories a never-failing inspiration and a veritable source book for plot material. To the modern reader, *The Decameron* affords undiminished stimulation and pleasure, despite the strictures and the vain attempts at suppression by hysterical censors. Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nPayne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).  \n\nCerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that *The Decameron* would not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of occasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury Department did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its importation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A. Falk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who indicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include shocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).  \n\nThe ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to John S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of *The Decameron*, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American universities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He stated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p. xxii).  \n\nCerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously, but Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed foreword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our friend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I rather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors, might shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the title page. Ernst received \\$50 for the foreword and \\$100 in legal fees. Cerf assured booksellers in an article in *PW* that the Payne translation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying the sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of public morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW* 119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).  \n\nSumner did not challenge the ML edition, but *The Decameron* remained a controversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who specialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML jacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any title at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the DROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales representative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of titles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked Lewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised: “Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern maidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a stink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).  \n\n*The Decameron* was the best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower than in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.  \n\n#### 209.1b.

Signed: Loederer. (*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> *Lord Jim* is by all odds the most popular novel by Joseph Conrad, as well as one of the most exciting adventure stories ever written. It is the story of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity. Conrad wrote an admirer “I will have no favorites, but I do not feel grieved that you prefer ‘*Lord Jim*’ to all my other books. I won’t even say that ‘I fail to understand’ . . .” (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday & McClure Co., 1900. New bibliographical edition published in Doubleday, Doran & Co.’s Sun Dial Library (1928), *The Malay Edition of the Works of Joseph Conrad* (1929), and possibly elsewhere. ML edition (pp. [iii], [vii]–417) printed from Sun Dial Library/Malay Edition plates with decorations in the Malay Edition omitted from pp. [iii–iv] and [1–2] of ML printings. Published February 1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.  \n\n*Lord Jim* was the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.  \n\nThe Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included Canadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights when they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers when they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the Macmillan Co. of Canada, sold *Lord Jim* for five months before Blackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the transgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped selling *Lord Jim* in Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian sales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards” (Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to Longwell, 4 September 1931).  \n\n*Lord Jim* sold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. Conrad’s *Victory* (238) sold 7,335 copies during the same period. Sales of *Lord Jim* totaled 115,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad was one of the best-selling authors in the ML. *Lord Jim* sold 8,669 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the 11th best-selling title in the regular ML; *Victory* was the 15th best-selling title. *Nostromo* (438), published in November 1951, appears to have lagged behind Conrad’s other titles; it did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML at this period.  \n\n#### 210b.

Its theme of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity and destroyed by his sense of lost honor is one of the most appealing in the literature of idealism. All the powers of a great descriptive artist and a thinker concerned with courage and devotion and the crises of conscience are lavished upon this tale of a man who stakes his life on a high principle and loses. “I will have no favorites,” Conrad wrote to an admirer, “but I do not feel grieved that you prefer *Lord Jim* to all my other books.” (*Spring 1955*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Non-pictorial in pale orange yellow (73) on coated white paper with lettering and decorations in deep reddish orange (36), moderate greenish blue (173) and black, with “O” in title suggesting a compass; background in pale orange yellow simulating parchment.

(*Fall 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Concededly the most important autobiography that has yet been written in America, *The Education of Henry Adams* has exercised an enormous influence upon a generation now coming into its full maturity. An edition of one hundred copies, printed privately in 1907, had aroused profound admiration among scholars. When it was published in 1918, it immediately won and has since held an assured place among the significant works in American literature. This chronicle of a brilliant career and a constant spiritual quest is one of our great national literary treasures. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), deep red (13) and gold on coated white paper with inset portrait of a young Henry Adams in deep red within a gold frame with city buildings outside frame at left and right; borders in gold, title in reverse on front panel, other lettering in deep red, all against vivid reddish orange background. Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nPrivately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade edition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s death. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927 and reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition (pp. [v]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates. Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1978/79.  \n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was one of the first titles Cerf tried to get after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original edition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a reprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August 1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint. Cerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of the original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told Houghton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be taken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin had reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It will be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very proud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).  \n\nHe offered a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two cents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for nonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930; Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf did not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the one-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin reduced the advance to \\$2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s to 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received \\$50 for writing the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).  \n\nScaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library edition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the plates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April 1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid 1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.  \n\nLater in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of *The Education of Henry Adams* in the format of the new ML Giants series. Around the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special printing of Young’s *The Medici* in the same format that had been made for Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of the first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the publisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”  \n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was the thirteenth best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed into the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782 copies.  \n\n#### 211b.

Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first published edition appeared. Although *The Education* had aroused a deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant works in American literature but among those which command a wide and steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation, the influence of the book is markedly increasing.” — from the Introduction  \n\n",

Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1958 by *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings* (502).  \n\nThe text of *Gulliver’s Travels*, according to the Prefatory Note, “is substantially that of the second edition, with the corrections in Ford’s interleaved copy” (p. v). The text of *Tale of a Tub* and *Battle of the Books* “is based on that of the fifth edition published in 1710. Together with the original notes from this edition are given a few from Hawkesworth’s edition of Swift’s Works (1755–75) and from Sir Walter Scott’s (1814); these are marked respectively with the initial H and S” (p. vi). Van Doren received the ML’s standard \\$50 fee for writing the introduction.  \n\n*Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* sold 5,463 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 212b.

For the child this chronicle of fabulous travels among pygmies and giants is an adventure in strange encounters and dramatic conflicts. For the adult it is a commentary and revelation on the mind and behavior of mankind in all its frauds and attempts at honesty, its fatuous and earnest struggles to live in some kind of amity and its preposterous posturings. It is fierce satire with rich meanings for every age and circumstance; it is pure fantasy and startling reality that explores and exposes the frailty of man. Included in this volume are Swift’s bitterly ironic comedies *A Tale of a Tub* and *The Battle of the Books*. (*Spring 1951*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in light greenish blue (172) and deep purple (224) on coated white paper with stylized left profile of Gulliver in deep purple with his eye represented by sailing ship and Lilliputian looking up at him from lower left; lettering in reverse and deep purple, background in light greenish blue. \n\n> Front flap reverts to 212a text.

And who better embodies all the quixotic zeal of the book missionary than Professor Roger Mifflin as he rides through the countryside with his caravan of culture? Pegasus, hitched to his wagon-load of books, carries him and the liberated Helen McGill to adventures and a romance as charming as any on the shelves of his wandering library. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1917. ML edition (pp. [1]–190) printed from Doubleday, Doran (and subsequently Lippincott) plates with Morley’s preface, “A Letter to David Grayson, Esq.,” omitted and the dedication omitted in the first printing. Publication initially announced for August 1931. Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1955.  \n\n*Parnassus on Wheels* was the second of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s books—*The Haunted Bookshop* was also in the Sun Dial Library—and settled on *Parnassus on Wheels*. Publication was announced for August 1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so great,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to bring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML wrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new printing they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had been sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged with Lippincott.  \n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished after the United States entered the Second World War. *Parnassus on Wheels* sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles—and he had two books in that category. *Human Being* (334), which lasted just over five years in the series, outsold *Parnassus on Wheels* by nearly 300 copies.  \n\n#### 213b.

(*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Katherine Mansfield’s sharp perceptions of significant detail, her vivid strokes of characterization and her ability so sensitively to merge reality with unreality give to her short stories the qualities of a remembered experience rather than those of a tale merely well told. In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for truth so evident in her life and work. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–255) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1931. *WR* 2 May 1931. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint contract with Knopf in October 1929 for *The Dove’s Nest*, paying a \\$500 advance. *The Garden Party* was not considered because an inexpensive reprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML bought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to cancel the contract for *The Dove’s Nest* so that the ML could include the more popular title. The ML increased the advance to \\$700 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when the ML increased its list price to \\$1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947).  \n\n*The Garden Party* had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There were printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an additional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies during the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June 1938). *The Garden Party* sold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern Library during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 214b.

(*Spring 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> André Gide combines a rich and supple imagination with a conscience that tolerates no squeamishness in the disclosure of the most personal intimacies. The unspeakable has no existence for him; his service to his own truth is constant and uncompromising. Of the thirty distinguished volumes he has published, many of them rare and unobtainable because of their revelations, *The Counterfeiters* is his only novel, and he has avowed in his Journal: “Without reserve, I want to pour into it everything.” The translation is complete and unexpurgated. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nBussy translation originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1931. *WR* 23 May 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1946. *The Counterfeiters* with *Journal of the Counterfeiters* published spring 1962 (see 216.2).  \n\nCerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition of *The Counterfeiters*, offering a \\$700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a copy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a copy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to \\$300) was intended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf, 18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.  \n\nKnopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication date was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the following year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s *Lafcadio’s Adventures*, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in spring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for *The Counterfeiters* (Knopf to Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the final reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably similar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for renewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep *The Counterfeiters* in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any spectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to Knopf, 24 October 1939).  \n\n*The Counterfeiters* sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and Giant sales.  \n\n#### 216.1b.

Among the novels of that era a small handful seem assured of permanence. They are Thomas Mann’s *The Magic Mountain*, James Joyce’s *Ulysses*, Marcel Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, and—without question—André Gide’s *The Counterfeiters*. Dorothy Bussy’s excellent translation of *Les Faux-Monnayeurs* was first published in 1927. To this edition of *The Counterfeiters* has been added the first English translation (by Justin O’Brien, well-known authority on Gide and translator of the *Journals of André Gide*) of the daybook kept by Gide while writing the novel. This Journal of “The Counterfeiters” (*Journal des Faux-Monnayeurs*) supplies a unique view into the mind of a great novelist at work. (*Spring 1962*)  \n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1951, with *The Counterfeiters* printed from plates of the 1927 Knopf edition and *Journal of “The Counterfeiters”* printed from a new typesetting.

Also published in Vintage Books, February 1973.  \n\nSixteen years after the original ML edition was discontinued, *The Counterfeiters* was restored to the ML in a single volume with Gide’s *Journal of “The Counterfeiters*.” In 1971 the ML was paying royalties of 8 cents a copy to Knopf.  \n\n#### 216.3a.

New bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by Ernest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published July 1931. *WR* 15 August 1931. First (and only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.  \n\nThe ML paid Viking an \\$800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. The ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large for its format.  \n\nSales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other advance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six months of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to competition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger than the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in 1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches taller than the ML edition.  \n\nThe ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press owned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine* irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf suggested an allowance of \\$240 but emphasized that the decision was entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates (Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates, and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).  \n\n#### ***Fall***  \n\n",

This historical chronicle of the apostolic mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity. Its rich humanity and its stirring account of the tenacity of a race giving way to the inevitable make it a memorable book to readers of every shade of religious conviction and literary taste. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published September 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.  \n\nWilla Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to include in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright. Cerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s *My Ántonia* or *The Song of the Lark*, offering royalties of eight cents a copy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who was then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they approached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of *Death Comes for the Archbishop*, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.  \n\nThe ML paid Knopf a \\$4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML printings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies (December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934), 5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the ML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows: 14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).  \n\nAfter the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want any of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked Knopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of the contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock after the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf, indicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September 25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:  \n\nIn reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather, and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the contract? . . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).  \n\nKnopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from her point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June 1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. *Death* *Comes* *for* *the* *Archbishop* was listed in the ML’s spring 1937 catalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to Eayrs, 28 May 1937).  \n\nIn 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, published *Death Comes for the Archbishop* in its paperback series Vintage Books.  \n\n#### 219.2.

Two French missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese, knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe, using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the New Mexican way of life. “There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly quiet narrative. It is a severe, purely designed chalice of handbeaten silver, filled to the brim with the white essential wine of love. . . .” — *Saturday Review*  \n\nNew bibliographical edition published by Knopf, 1945.

Signed: Wuyts. (*Fall 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The Borgian era, with all its excesses of lust and murder, its monstrous villainies and strange benevolences, is here unfolded in a tapestry of unrestrained color and animation. Frederick Baron Corvo, that unpredictable celebrant of Black Masses and practitioner of bizarre literary heresies, depicts the unbridled licence of the 15th Century with a demoniacal vision and an incandescent brilliance of metaphor. *A History of the Borgias* throws new light on the myths and legends surrounding one of the vilest and most glittering reigns of human depravity. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *Chronicles of the House of Borgia* by E. P. Dutton, 1901, using sheets of the English edition. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the Leslie introduction added and the bibliography, appendices, and illustrations from the original edition omitted. (The ML table of contents erroneously lists appendices.) Published September 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1960.  \n\nThe ML edition was the first to be set in type and printed in the U.S. Leslie’s introduction, a general study of the life and work of Frederick Rolfe, “Baron Corvo,” originally appeared as the introduction to Corvo’s *In His Own Image* (Knopf, 1925) and was reprinted by arrangement with Knopf. The ML omitted several paragraphs of Leslie’s text and altered the sentence beginning, “*Hadrian VII* is Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” to “*Hadrian VII* with the possible exception of the Book on the Borgias is Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” (ML, p. xxi).  \n\nPrintings of the ML edition reached 36,000 copies by June 1954 (Woolf, *Bibliography of Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo*, p. 46). *A History of the Borgias* sold 2,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 220b.

Klopfer was unaware of the translator’s identity. He noted, “The book isn’t copyrighted in this country, but I cannot tell you who did the translation. It is passable” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, John Lane, The Bodley Head, 20 October 1931).  \n\nThe ML’s plates were also used for printings by Walter J.

Signed: illegible (possibly Art or Nat Falk). (*Fall 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The novel upon which William McFee’s reputation rests most securely is *Casuals of the Sea*. When it appeared, twenty years ago, he was hailed, with Joseph Conrad, as one of the two greatest story-tellers of the sea. Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against the forces of nature and man’s will. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916. ML edition printed from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new typesetting. Published November 1931. *WR* 5 December 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.  \n\nCerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in January 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly interested in *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, but McFee appears to have been opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf invited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s *Purple Land* (134) and indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the possibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels, *Casuals of the Sea* and *Command*, were in the Sun Dial Library, which the ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both novels, but in the end only *Casuals of the Sea* was added.  \n\nMorley’s introduction to *Casuals of the Sea* was originally for the Lambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.  \n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran a \\$1,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when there was a printing of 1,000 copies.  \n\n*Casuals of the Sea* sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.  \n\nWhen Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition of *Command* in 1933, Cerf responded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book, but [it] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished somewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de Graff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In 1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in *Casuals of the Sea* to McFee and sold him the plates for \\$70. The ML signed a new contract with McFee and paid him \\$70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to be applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the plates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a copy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).  \n\n#### 223b.

(*Fall 1931*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in strong yellow green (117) and black on pale yellow green (121) paper with 2-line title in strong yellow green highlighted in black and sandwiched between six strong yellow green bands, simulating a barrel labeled TONO BUNGAY, the quack cure-all about which the story revolves; borders in strong yellow green, other lettering in black. (*Fall 1931*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Since H. G. Wells wrote *Tono-Bungay*, his forays into prophecy and history have made him world famous. Yet it is doubtful whether his later fame was as firmly grounded as the first spontaneous outburst of acclaim given to *Tono-Bungay*. With its appearance, H. G. Wells forced immediate recognition as a major figure in contemporary English letters. Neither time nor all the subsequent writings of the prolific and indefatigable Mr. Wells has dimmed the sparkle and vivacity of this chronicle of chicanery and human credulity. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Duffield & Co., 1909. ML edition (225.1, pp. [*5-6*], [1]–460) printed from Duffield & Green plates. Published December 1931. *WR* 26 December 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nCerf expressed interest in *Tono-Bungay* in 1929 when he offered Duffield & Green a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated that the offer would stand indefinitely, and these appear to be the terms under which the ML edition was published two years later. The plates became the property of Dodd, Mead & Co. when Dodd, Mead bought Duffield & Green in 1934.  \n\nBy June 1936 ML printings totaled 12,000 copies and sales totaled 10,675 copies. *Tono-Bungay* sold 4,382 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 225.1b.

(*Spring 1959*)  \n\nAn internal RH memo (Regina Spirito to Manny Harper, 5 May 1945) indicates that new plates were being made for *Tono-Bungay* along with Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage* (199), Buck’s *The Good Earth* (266) and Maugham’s *Moon and Sixpence* (283). By eliminating running heads, printing more text on each page, and beginning new chapters on the same page as the ending of the preceding chapter, the total number of pages of *Tono-Bungay* was reduced from 460 to 400. Although Germany surrendered to the Allies the day before Spirito’s memo was written, the war with Japan continued for another four months. Publishers were subjected to increasingly severe paper rationing during the Second World War, and the crowded typesetting is typical of many books of the period. It is not clear why the table of contents is paginated xix–xii.  \n\nThe new typesetting of *The Good Earth* was also about 60 pages shorter than the earlier edition. *Of Human Bondage* was only 6 pages shorter, and the new typesetting of *Moon and Sixpence* was 27 pages longer.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nWells, *War in the Air* (1917–1924) 5  \nWells, *Ann Veronica* (1917–1934) 24  \n\n",

Each panel of this triptych is complete and self-contained, yet it links together three epochal periods of world history: the 4th century, the Renaissance and 18th century Russia. *Peter and Alexis* becomes the climax of the entire work and thus one of Merejkowski’s most absorbing novels. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Romance of Peter the Great* by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1906, in a different translation.

Discontinued 1 January 1941.  \n\nThe ML edition was published more than a year after its announced publication date. Guerney (as usual) took longer than he anticipated to complete the translation, and Cerf (as usual) expressed frustration and irritation at the delay. Cerf indicated hopefully in February 1931 that the translation was almost finished and that the book should be ready around the first of May (Cerf to Crowder, 11 February 1931). Ten days later he noted, “We have had a lot of trouble having the translation of this book completed” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). A letter in June indicated, “. . . at present we do not know when it will be finished and ready for publication” (ML to John D.

In Dostoyevsky’s mind, crime is its own punishment and retributive justice can never be as severe as the penalty the human soul can impose on itself.

The editors of the Modern Library unhesitatingly list it among the greatest novels of all time. That it ranks as one of the five best sellers in the entire series is a tribute to the taste of the American public. That the author is now in exile from his native land is a commentary on the Hitler regime that needs no amplification. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nLowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–900) printed from Knopf plates with table of contents consolidated from vols. 1 and 2, fly title omitted, and page numeral “xi” removed from the foreword. Published January 1932. *WR* 13 February 1932. First printing: 17,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1938.  \n\nCerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of *The Magic Mountain* in 1929, when he offered a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather than the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have to be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint contract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf did not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the standard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years (Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have not been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12 cents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the end the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular printers.  \n\nSales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883 copies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies (1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).  \n\nKnopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year term. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will be a \\$3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more revenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have the book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in October 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint contract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a large final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his appreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your attitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot of things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf to Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.  \n\nCerf never accepted the loss of *The Magic Mountain* and tried repeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical. In 1942, after Mann’s *Buddenbrooks* (285) had also been withdrawn from the ML, Cerf offered a \\$5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a copy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you” for permission to publish *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant. He added, “Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know why this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back than any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July 1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is just too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on any arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the necessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied: “I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow *Buddenbrooks* into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann title somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent the best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).  \n\n*The Magic Mountain* was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s acquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML in 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nMann, *Buddenbrooks* (1935–1940) 285  \nMann, Thomas, *Stories of Three Decades* (Giant, 1961–1973; 1979–1986) G97  \nMann, *Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man* (1965–1971) 577  \nMann, *Doctor Faustus* (1966– ) 582  \n\n",

Signed C. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The story of the vicissitudes attendant upon the publisher’s suppression, in 1901, of *Sister Carrie* is the history of America’s emergence from the fog of suspicion and fear of realism in the novel. On the score of his uncompromising fight, Theodore Dreiser must be regarded a pioneer and liberator. His *Sister Carrie* pointed the tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown internationally famous. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired the Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W. Dodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and Boni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. [*1*]–557) printed from Dreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nDreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it was rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday, Page at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a reader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:  \n\n> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred of them. (p. vi)  \n\n[James L. W. West III](http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html) notes:  \n\nFrank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication. Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of Pennsylvania Library, 2000).  \n\nDoubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450 unbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456 copies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and Dreiser received royalties of \\$68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates that the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies of *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor & Company (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later purchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister Carrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.  \n\nThe ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a \\$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid \\$500 of the advance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates which had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited to Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML edition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania. Dreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing was required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions for the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s death the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser Papers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).  \n\nDreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was originally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s Note on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:  \n\n> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser, however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements covering the two-fifty edition [the trade edition published by Boni & Liveright in 1917], and it was only in February, 1932, after more attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.  \n\n*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the 1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies by the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of \\$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.  \n\n#### 230b.

On the score of his uncompromising fight against censorship and for the new and rising school of American naturalism, Theodore Dreiser earned the right to be regarded as a pioneer and liberator. His *Sister Carrie* was the forerunner of a tendency in American fiction for at least a quarter of a century and even today it remains a monumental achievement as a novel of great sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness.

(*Fall 1931*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9 April 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories* (27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision of the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been awaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short Stories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to scrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection that we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected with due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the fourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s collection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).  \n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to “Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.  \n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\n#### 232b. *Rothschild’s Fiddle* added (1936?)\n\nTitle as 232a.\n\nPp.

For their range and variety, for their acuteness of observation and for their simple humanity, these stories reveal the fullest powers of his genius. Tchekov’s unfailing insight into the lives of ordinary people, his ability to dramatize the most commonplace situations and his gentle humor made him not only one of the greatest of short-story writers but also one of the most beloved.

(*Spring 1932*)  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in deep purple (224) and black on gray paper depicting a barefoot man kneeling by a body of water and drinking; borders in deep purple, lettering in black. Signed: [Jacob] Burck. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\nOriginally published by Jonathan Cape & Harrison Smith, 1931. ML edition (pp. 1–380) printed from Cape & Smith plates. Published March 1932. *WR* 26 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Published in Vintage Books, spring 1967.  \n\nCerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the ML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your Modern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to take with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE FURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the time the book was published, in your list [Scott’s 10-page pamphlet, *On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,* was published by Cape & Smith in 1929]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will be a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us up.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few volumes. He requested Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* and any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books in which a Dostoyefsky [*sic*] influence was found. I have never read Dostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf, 15 April 1931).  \n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to include *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay Dying*, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type which had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s audience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the cost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in production and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House between 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for books without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was cheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the possibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year or so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be instructed to melt the type (Harter, *The Making of William Faulkner’s Books, 1929*–*1939*, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult for reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive reprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial publication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from the original publisher’s plates.  \n\nFaulkner’s next book, *Sanctuary*, had more commercial appeal. It was the only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were made. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback. The American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet Books—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight printings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies (Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on front cover).  \n\nIn his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he initially wrote *Sanctuary* for money. The introduction begins:  \n\n> This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea, because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been writing books for about five years, which got published but not bought. . . . \n> Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)  \n\nAfter sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job working the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between 12 and 4, I wrote *As I Lay Dying* in six weeks, without changing a word. I sent it to Smith [his publisher] and wrote him that by it I would stand or fall.” He continues:  \n\n>I think I had forgotten about *Sanctuary*, just as you might forget about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off. *As I Lay Dying* was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of *Sanctuary* until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* too much and I made a fair job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)  \n\nFaulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than the rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be reset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees Book Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the introduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like Burck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when E. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger format.  \n\nFaulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith & Haas. *Sanctuary* remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published together in a single volume.  \n\n*Sanctuary* sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Faulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the series. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML, followed by *Light in August* (429), *Absalom, Absalom!* (434), and *Sanctuary* (233), which sold 4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.  \n\n#### 233.1b.

It is a virile, challenging novel that cannot be ignored or set aside. *Sanctuary* arouses the most extreme enthusiasm or revulsion; it holds spellbound its most ardent admirers and bitterest foes from first sentence to last.

When Mr. Faulkner saw the galley proofs of that version of *Sanctuary*, he felt “that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it.” \n> He chose the latter course and did a thorough revision of the book, cutting some sections entirely and adding new ones, rewriting other sections in whole or in part, and rearranging the order of the narration. He thus succeeded in making it a book which “would not shame . . . too much,” as he put it, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, which had been published in the two preceding years. (*Inside of jacket blank; back flap lists Faulkner titles published in the ML through fall 1964.*)  \n\nThe letterpress plate for the 233.1c title page appears to have been used for 233.1d with the line for Faulkner’s introduction and the rule at the foot of the page removed and torchbearer H substituted for torchbearer D3.  \n\nThe memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from *Sanctuary* and *Absalom, Absalom!* was dated 14 November 1962 (Box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s *Light in August* was also dropped around this time. The earliest printing of *Sanctuary* without the introduction was in 1963 or 1964. Introductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, including *Sanctuary*, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—*Selected Short Stories*, *Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and *Pylon*—were new to the series. *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, had previously been combined in a single ML volume.  \n\n",

The fate of the novel itself is the highest tribute to its quality.

In *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy. The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last decade of the nineteenth century. (*Fall 1956*)  \n\nBibliographical edition originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1920. ML edition (pp. xxv–[xxxiv], [1] – [508]) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with running heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s Wessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format, 1979–86.  \n\nWhen plans were made to publish *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* in MLCE, Stein offered Weber \\$150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30 June 1950). Weber accepted but added:  \n\n> I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what, please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).  \n\nStein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920 edition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport, Tennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty of 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML format, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer. The ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the Harper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950). The map was included at Weber’s suggestion.  \n\n#### 234.2b.

(*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Generation after generation of Americans has been brought up on the poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. To him can be attributed a major share of what love for poetry great masses of our people cherish. Such poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great lyricists of our national literature. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.  \n\nLongfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his time. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when Longfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes substantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at Harvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death he received \\$4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice what he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained sufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin Co., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher, Ticknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced its edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott at Houghton Mifflin:  \n\n> A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we first noticed your announcement . . . [Longfellow is the] Poet of Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”  \n\nLinscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for which the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy acknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).  \n\nThe ML initially intended to base its edition on *The Poems of Henry W. Longfellow*, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library series. Linscott wrote again four days later:  \n\n> You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow” which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19 January 1932).  \n\nLinscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete Cambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.  \n\nAt this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant figure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537), intervened. He wrote Cerf:  \n\n> I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it [the Longfellow matter]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters. \n> Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, *et cetera*, or can you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February 1932)  \n\nBoth Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of Longfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to Linscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932). Linscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may have gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the circumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at present” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).  \n\nIn the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the copyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include nearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.  \n\nWhen the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who acknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best wishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML edition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a new typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that had entered the public domain since 1932.  \n\n*The Poems of Longfellow* and *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* (236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and Franklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for *The Poems of Longfellow* remained in use until the early 1940s.  \n\nCerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s, but it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. *The Poems of Longfellow* sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed services. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on to its first-quarter ranking.  \n\n#### 235.1b.

Printer, inventor, philosopher, diplomat, champion of liberty, he made his influence felt not only upon his own time, but upon every American generation. His wise maxims and shrewd observations have become national axioms. His *Autobiography*, as rich in material as it is engaging in style, is one of those rare documents that reveals both a rich personality and the crucial events that transpired during his lifetime. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nCerf originally planned to publish Franklin’s *Autobiography* by itself. Three months before publication he decided to add more of Franklin’s writings so the book would be a better value. Goodman, who suggested the additional contents, received \\$100 for his work on the volume.  \n\n*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* and *The Poems of Longfellow* (235) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and Longfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from this day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press unless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both the typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think that the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to William Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).  \n\nThe Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed pictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first printing are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained in use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive jackets the ML ever used.  \n\n*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* sold 5,569 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,468 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—a decline in real terms compared with the Second World War, when book sales of all kinds were booming, but enough to place it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.  \n\n#### 236.1b.

Signed: L. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving romance, *A Farewell to Arms*, have won acclaim from the critics, support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators. Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed, athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s strength. *A Farewell to Arms* is an exciting book, true to its time and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. [v–vii], [1]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half title used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.  \n\nThe ML offered Scribner’s a \\$6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf initially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931 publication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering \\$75 and indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January 1932).  \n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies (July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March 1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling 14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111 copies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *A Farewell to Arms* sold 12,287 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of *The Sun Also Rises*. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.  \n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of the Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *A Farewell to Arms* was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr., Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a \\$3.00 hardbound edition in March 1953 and a \\$1.65 paperback in 1962.  \n\n#### 237b.

(*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The devotees of the novels of Joseph Conrad divide their enthusiasm equally between *Victory* and *Lord Jim* (No. 186 in the Modern Library). Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the World War, *Victory* has steadily grown in prestige through almost a quarter of a century. New readers come upon it as a rare discovery and old readers return to it for the sheer enjoyment of its prose style and subtle characterization. *Victory* represents Joseph Conrad at the apex of his story-telling powers. (*Fall 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1915. ML edition printed from plates made from a new Doubleday, Doran typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published June 1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nCerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to *Victory*. In 1928 he offered an advance of \\$3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a royalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do appreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is unwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21 December 1928). *Victory* was included in the Sun Dial Library published by Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title included in the series. *Victory* was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial Library titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a \\$1,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.  \n\n*Victory* sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Lord Jim* (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales of *Victory* totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad was one of the ML’s best-selling authors. *Victory* sold 7,966 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the twelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. *Lord Jim* was the eighth best-selling title.  \n\n#### 238b.

(*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> A band of pirates captures a vessel bound for England that contains a miscellaneous cargo—including a group of children who have been driven from their home by a West Indian hurricane. The difficulties encountered by the well-meaning buccaneers with these incredible children provide the frame-work for one of the most unusual books in the Modern Library series—a shocking, nerve-tingling story that the reader will never forget. (*Spring 1937*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros., 1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July 1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1958.  \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated interest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his personal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself have bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk about a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he stated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in the Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and I have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the author’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint contract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a warm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the Modern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is released” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).  \n\nWhen the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed Klopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the Readers Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s president, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was available (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and convinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail order sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would like to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the option to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer to Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty remained from the \\$750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed in 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but without an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the ML could pay \\$250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club edition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).  \n\nIn 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in adding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349) to the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper director of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the ML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had textbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer replied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition from an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department wants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the Modern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956).  \n\n*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 239b.

A compilation which includes Marlowe, Dekker, Heywood, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Massinger and Ford must be a treasury to be cherished by every modern reader. It is a book that has won for itself a distinguished place on the Modern Library shelf. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published August 1932. *WR* 10 September 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969.  \n\nThe plays in the anthology were selected by Cerf. He asked George C. D. Odell of Columbia University what he thought of the selection and invited him to write the introduction (Cerf to Odell, 9 April 1931). Odell approved the plays but declined to write the introduction because he was on sabbatical in Paris. That fall Cerf invited a succession of scholars to write the introduction—Hardin Craig of Stanford University, Felix E. Schelling of the University of Pennsylvania, J. F. A. Pyre of the University of Wisconsin, and John Livingston Lowes of Harvard University. As one after another declined, Cerf doubled the fee from fifty to one hundred dollars. Esther Cloudman Dunn of Smith College accepted the assignment in February 1932 and received the \\$100 fee.  \n\n*Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays* sold 2,678 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. The ML sold over 70,000 copies of *Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays* by 1969 when *Drama of the English Renaissance*, edited by M. L.

Master of the scintillant epigram and electric repartee, he is nowhere so happy and felicitous as in his dramatic writings. In time his prose may grow faint in memory and his poetry may be given a somewhat less lustrous appraisal, but he will always be remembered as the creator of these inimitably urbane, ironic and effervescent comedies.

That genius is nowhere more apparent than in his plays, whose witty dialogue and paradoxical situations still have the power to charm, both on the stage and between covers. This volume contains one of his most perennially popular, *The Importance of Being Earnest*, whose satiric comments on English society and the clergy have never been surpassed; *Salomé*, considered shocking in its day, on which Richard Strauss’ opera is based; and three plays, *Lady Windemere’s* [*sic*] *Fan*, *a Woman of No Importance* and *An Ideal Husband*, which give full play to Wilde’s scorn for hypocrisy.  \n\nPrinted from offset plates photographically reproduced from an earlier ML printing.

The forty tales in this volume represent him in the fullness of his powers, when his vision, style and artistry were at their apex. These stories were chosen and translated by Michael Monahan, whose introduction is a bold commentary and an acute analysis of Maupassant’s work. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection combining two ML volumes originally published by Boni & Liveright: *Love and Other Stories* (72) and *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories* (8). Pp. [iii], i–xi, [*1*], 1–212 printed from plates of *Love and Other Stories*; pp. 7–251 printed from plates of *Mademoiselle Fifi and Other Stories*. Published spring 1932. *WR* 15 October 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1945 by *The Best Stories of Guy de Maupassant*, ed. Saxe Commins (383).  \n\nDespite the statement on the title page Monahan does not appear to be the translator of all the stories in the collection. He was credited as the translator of *Love and Other Stories* (1919); the ML edition of *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories* (1917) did not identify the translator. One story appears twice in the combined volume in different translations. “A Piece of String” (pp. 213–22) was added to *Love and Other Stories* by 1930. It was also included (in a different translation) as “The Piece of String” (pp. 23–31) in *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories*.  \n\nMaupassant’s *Best Stories* sold 6,269 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.

(*Fall 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The perpetual enchantment and all the magical and multi-colored pageantry of *The Arabian Nights* are offered here in Sir Richard Burton’s rendering for the delectation of adult minds. Shahrazad spins her tales without censorial interruption, and the spell that possessed King Shahryar and since then has possessed mankind is not broken, praise be to Allah, by discreet asterisks and decorous euphemisms. The tales in this volume were chosen because they are the most fascinating and representative of *The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night*. (*Fall 1937*)  \n\nOriginal ML selection. Published September 1932. *WR* 15 October 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.  \n\nThe title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text that there was no room for the torchbearer or for Cerf and Klopfer’s names in the imprint.  \n\nCerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on the title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not strictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation of “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and unabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the stories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional phrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I believe it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged” (Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML made three sets of plates, two of which were sold for \\$950 each to Walter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the book for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in September 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition in November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap borrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition, paying the ML a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).  \n\n*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling ML titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 244b.

It omits nothing and condones nothing of the abominations of the oldest profession in the world. The stark picture of a brothel and the prostitute’s way of life becomes by the artistry of Alexandre Kuprin an indictment more scathing and effective than all the moral indignation of vice crusaders and the periodical revelations of the police. *Yama* carries horror to a point beyond horror and into the realm of great realistic literature. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nGuerney translation originally published (“privately printed”) for subscribers only, 1922. New edition published by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, 1929, with additions, revisions, and corrections by the author, a foreword by Arthur Garfield Hays, and an author’s postscript. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting based on the 1929 edition. Publication scheduled for October 1932 but moved forward to September when Marx’s *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* (246) was postponed. *WR* 15 October 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1952.  \n\nGuerney’s introduction to the 1929 edition was revised for the ML.  \n\nThe ML paid Guerney a \\$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. The contract specified that royalties were to drop to 9½ cents after the first 20,000 copies. Cerf originally offered Guerney royalties of 9½ cents on all copies but increased the offer following negotiations with Guerney. The \\$800 cost of making new plates was split between Guerney and the ML. Guerney’s half was to be charged against royalties after sales passed 20,000 copies, and the plates were to remain the property of the ML (Cerf to Guerney, 17 February 1931).  \n\n*Yama* sold 2,700 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles.  \n\n#### 245b.

(*Fall 1932*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in deep reddish orange (36) and black on cream paper depicting Marx with marching workers in background; borders in deep reddish orange, lettering in black.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> With one-sixth of the habitable world governed by Marxian doctrines and with the rest of the world facing the possibility of a Communist social order, the writings of Karl Marx become more a modern revelation and prophecy than a mere economic interpretation of history. His *Capital and Other Writings*, judiciously and discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the shelf of the Modern Library. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of *Capital* and Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint of *The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of “Capital,”* edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L. Trask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML edition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until October because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.  \n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S. The ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L. Trask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is usually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and *Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.  \n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932). Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a Russian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p. xix).  \n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested, Declined” under 1933 for more information.  \n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack of an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*: “I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to Schuster, 8 February 1933).  \n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 with sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in the past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).  \n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s *Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.  \n\n#### 246b.

Only a few books have survived. Of these, *Three Soldiers* stands pre-eminent. It reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. *Three Soldiers* introduced a writer who has since become a major figure among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests securely. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\nOriginally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled for November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1963.  \n\nEight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday, Doran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern Library, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and Three Soldiers.” He asked how many copies *Three Soldiers* had sold in the trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial Library (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that the plates for *Three Soldiers* were too large for the ML’s format he contacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer* and *The 42nd Parallel*. *Manhattan Transfer* had sold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for *The 42nd Parallel* (Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those titles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin with *Three Soldiers* and added *The 42nd Parallel* (307) to the ML five years later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos Passos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.  \n\nFor *Three Soldiers* the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of \\$1,250 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his corrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know if I made more corrections in the *Three Soldiers* text than you can handle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were just going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was away when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked Cerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling corrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were. The introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was doing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf, undated).  \n\n*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from Doubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500 copies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20 August 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\nHoughton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.* (G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality paperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination agreement in June and instructed the production department to make no more printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June 1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock and asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to bring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick Moseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated that the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a year, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley, 22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if *Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was (Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January 1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that year.  \n\n*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after fall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the end of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The Buddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring 1969 after the oversight was discovered.  \n\n#### 248b.

All the hope and frustration, the idealism and iniquity, the sensualism and ascetism [*sic*] of an epoch come into a magical synthesis on Feuchtwanger’s enormous canvas.

(*Fall 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations. Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second only to the furore created by his own *Trilby*. Then as a play, it has been, since 1915, a perennial favorite. As an opera, with a score by Deems Taylor, it found a prominent place in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and, finally as a cinema, it has reached countless thousands of people. In its original form, it remains a book of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (*Spring 1937*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1891. New bibliographical edition published by Harper & Brothers with a 1919 copyright date; the new edition was probably published in the 1920s. ML edition (pp. [ii], v–vii, [1]–416) printed from plates of the later Harper edition. Published December 1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First printing: 7,450 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.  \n\nThe royalties that the ML paid to Harper & Brothers were based on sales, in contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number of copies printed. *Peter Ibbetson* was one of the few books in the ML printed on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary because of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first printing may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing of 8,000 copies and received 7,450.  \n\nWhen the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s that it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations and asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the wood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the plates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s balloon-cloth format.  \n\n*Peter Ibbetson* sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 250b.

(*Fall 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> How to make available to the contemporary reader all the beauty of thought, language and imagery of *The Divine Comedy* has been the primary consideration of the editors of the Modern Library in issuing this translated version of Dante’s masterpiece, complete and unabridged. After careful consideration of all the extant English translations and after consultation with the foremost university authorities, the Carlyle-Wicksteed rendering was chosen. It gives the entire scope, substance and spirit of *The Divine Comedy* to those numberless readers who cannot cope with the original. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in vivid red (11) and strong brown (55) on coated cream paper depicting Dante with an open book standing on a hillside overlooking the walls of a city, viewed through a border of stone portals; background within borders in vivid red with title and statement of responsibility for translation in reverse, other lettering in strong brown. Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1937; unsigned. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A. (*Fall 1937*)  \n\nCarlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by J. M. Dent & Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and subsequently in Vintage Books.  \n\nThe ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of reports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from Henry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the translation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice Firuski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the translation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by T. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber \\$60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on Dante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent of Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski, 28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering \\$75 for an introduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to Grandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.  \n\nCerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few paragraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932). Grandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using and knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the best translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher (Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an inferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the Temple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph by the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of the English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle, Thomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is clear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be readily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its scholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p. xiii).  \n\nThe Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s *Divine Comedy* the best translations have been followed: *Inferno*, by John Aiken Carlyle; *Purgatorio*, by Thomas Okey; *Paradisio*, by Philip H. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim) follow, in the main, the excellent notes for the *Inferno* and the *Purgatorio* by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr. Oeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the *Paradisio*” (251.1, p. 3; 251.2, p. xvii).  \n\nML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to the translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the translator of *Purgatorio*. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations were not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML printings until 1963/64 (251.2c).  \n\nShortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S. Singleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of *The Divine Comedy* for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working on a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled to be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the approval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after theirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances totaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took longer than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years later it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The Bollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and 1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary. By that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become moribund and had ceased adding new titles.  \n\n*The Divine Comedy* sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant titles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.  \n\n#### 251.1b.

Signed: L. (*Fall 1932*)   \n\n> Front flap:<br> The modern point of view, contemptuous of all the old canons of Victorian morality, beauty and love, is nowhere more brilliantly championed than in the novels of Aldous Huxley. Full of shrewd commentaries and stinging humor, his books are extravaganzas that satirize the world of today. The two novels by which he is best known, *Point Counter Point* (No. 180) and *Antic Hay*, are in the same temper. Both are as sophisticated as the age they reflect. *Antic Hay* is a novel for the enlightened modern. (*Spring 1936*)   \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1923. ML edition (252.1, pp. 7–350) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing: 6,000 copies.   \n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf invited Lewis Gannett to write an introduction to a forthcoming ML title of his choice. He selected *Antic Hay* as the most appealing but was disappointed with the \\$50 fee; he had assumed the ML paid more.   \n\n*Antic Hay* sold 3,427 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203) sold 7,733 copies—more than twice as many as *Antic Hay*—during the same period. *Antic Hay* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\nDoubleday, Doran sold its plates and publishing rights to Huxley’s older books to Harper & Bros. in 1939. Harper’s considered withdrawing *Antic Hay* and *Point Counter Point* from the ML, but Klopfer was able to negotiate new reprint contracts (see 203). New five-year contracts for the books were sent to Harper’s on 30 March 1939. The *Antic Hay* contract called for the ML to pay a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least 2,500 copies after three years.   \n\n#### 252.1b.

(*Spring 1954*)   \n\nNew bibliographical edition (252.2, pp. 3–328) printed from plates of the English edition published in 1923 by Chatto & Windus. It is not known whether Harper’s acquired the original Chatto & Windus plates or had duplicates made. In 1948 William H. Rose of Harper & Bros. wrote Klopfer that new plates were needed for *Antic Hay* and asked if the ML would share the cost (Rose to Klopfer, 7 June 1948). The plates were being used primarily by the ML, and Klopfer agreed to contribute \\$500 over a five-year period. During that time the ML paid an extra 2 cents a copy above the regular 10-cent royalty rate; any balance remaining was to be paid at the end of five years. The ML still owed \\$180 in 1953, so the ML appears to have sold 16,000 copies during that period (Rose to Klopfer, 23 July 1953).   \n\nHarper’s informed the ML in 1956 that they were planning to add *Antic Hay* to Harper’s Modern Classics but did not ask that the ML edition be withdrawn.   \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library:</span>   \nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (1930–1967) 203   \nHuxley, *Brave New World* (1956–1967) 485   \n\n",

(*Fall 1932*)   \n\nA. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co., 1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American branch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made from a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.   \n\nThe original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format. For its edition of France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163), published in 1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off the running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the headline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was one of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf considered doing the same for *Penguin Island* (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4 November 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The result was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages shorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.   \n\nThe ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the translator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years after the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of the title page of 253c, published in 1984.   \n\nThe ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s (an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939) but picked up in the 1940s. *Penguin Island* sold 4,876 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\nThe publication of *Penguin Island* brought the number of France’s works in the ML to five. *The Queen* *Pédauque* was discontinued at the end of 1933; by the end of 1942 *Penguin Island* was the only title by France in the series.   \n\n#### 253b.

A humorous critique of customs and laws, rituals and rites, its subject is human nature, but its characters are penguins in the mythical land of Penguinia. The story of the strutting penguins and their virtues and vices is not merely a burlesque allegory of French history, it is a satire of the history of mankind. With gentle yet biting irony, France challenges the Spencerian belief in the ultimate perfectability [*sic*] of man, though his irony reveals his sympathy for man’s weaknesses and his need for social institutions.   \n\nPublished fall 1984 at \\$6.95.

In it the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature has created a gallery of characters which, it is safe to predict, will remain unforgettable for generations. Leora, the indomitable comrade and wife; Gottlieb, the incorruptible scientist; Sondelius, the crusader against plagues; and Arrowsmith, the doctor in whom a holy flame is kindled— these are characters who give to the novel its immense power and its blazing indignation. (*Spring 1936*)   \n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1925. ML edition (254.1, pp. [iii], 1–448) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February 1933. *WR* 4 March 1933. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1952.   \n\nThe ML edition (254.1a) was larger than the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format so that it could be printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Publication of the ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film version starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the appearance of Lewis’s new novel *Ann Vickers.* The ML urged booksellers to feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement, *PW*, 14 January 1933, p. 98).   \n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset & Dunlap, which also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace plates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the original Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier & Son.   \n\n*Arrowsmith* sold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making *Arrowsmith* the thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153 copies ahead of Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*.   \n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *Arrowsmith*, Lewis’s *Babbitt*, and seven other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML’s contract for *Arrowsmith* had four years to run. Harcourt, Brace confirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the firm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to Klopfer, 28 April 1952).   \n\n#### 254.1b.

(*Fall 1933*)   \n\n> Front flap:<br> The anthologist does not live who can compile a collection of short stories and avoid loud protests for his omissions. In the field of the German short story the choice is so wide that an inclusion of all favorites would make a volume of encyclopedic bulk. This anthology puts forth a comprehensive group of short novels and tales, selected primarily because they are representative of the main currents of German literature and those great national figures—Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Zweig and others—who made it the world’s heritage. (*Fall 1934*)   \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1933. *WR* 29 April 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by *Great German Short Novels and Stories*, ed. Victor Lange (451).   \n\nThomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology of German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February 1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed responsibility for the anthology:   \n\n> It was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a considerable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He expressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract was duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still roaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled. At long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German authors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with the job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to gather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and exercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to the publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the wastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)   \n\nHitler came to power shortly before *Great German Short Novels and Stories* was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the volume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf, 17 April 1933).   \n\nWhen *Great German Short Novels and Stories* was being planned Cerf contacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s *Death in Venice*, offering a fee of \\$200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a Thomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been published in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf had published Kenneth Burke’s translation of *Death in Venice* as a separate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T. Lowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the out-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a \\$300 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.   \n\n*Great German Short Novels and Stories* sold 4,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.   \n\n#### 256b.

One hundred years after its first publication it still retains its original vitality and makes the world in which Becky Sharp and its many other memorable characters lived as meaningful as our own. Few, if any, novels in English give so comprehensive a picture of the structure of its society, ranging from the aristocracy, the gentry, the merchants, the military, the colonials and the bohemians to the lowly and the impecunious. *Vanity Fair* is a panoramic novel that makes a startling commentary on its own times and customs with wit and audacity and perception. It is one of the imperishable classics of English fiction. This volume is embellished by Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches. (*Spring 1951*)   \n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br> When it was written over one hundred years ago, Thackeray described *Vanity Fair* as “a novel without a hero.” If it did lack a central protagonist, his great work more than compensated for this deliberate omission with a gallery of memorable characters now known and beloved by readers of every shade of taste and opinion. To be able to issue *Vanity Fair*, with Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches, in a single volume of 784 [*sic*] pages, complete and unabridged, fulfills the first aim of the Modern Library: to make available the greatest book treasures of the past and present in a convenient and inexpensive form. (*Fall 1954*)   \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.   \n\nEarly in 1950 Stein contacted Gordon S. Ray, chairman of the English department at the University of Illinois and the preeminent Thackeray scholar in the United States, to see if he would be willing to write an introduction to the MLCE edition of *Vanity Fair* instead of Thackeray’s *History of Henry Esmond* (297) as previously arranged. Stein described the conversation in a memo to Haas:   \n\n> What came back over the telephone wire was a very blistering attack upon our edition of VANITY FAIR. He said that he uses the edition in his classes with reluctance and that he always apologizes to them for having to use it. His principal points of complaint are: \n> 1\\) Our edition is not based on the final text. \n> 2\\) Our edition does not include Thackeray’s own preface to the book. \n> 3\\) Our edition is full of typographic errors. \n> 4\\) We do not reproduce Thackeray’s own illustrations. \n> I am checking into the text of VANITY FAIR to find out exactly what is involved in producing a completely satisfactory book and will let you know within a few days what I turn up. Next Friday Ray will be in town and I have an appointment with him. Naturally I hope that I can at that time assure him that we will put out a completely satisfactory edition. At the moment the principal inexpensive editions of VANITY FAIR that are available are Modern Library, Everyman’s Library, and Great Illustrated Classics (Dodd, Mead, \\$2.50). Neither Harper nor Rinehart has an edition of VANITY FAIR available right now, but Rinehart does have one in preparation. It seems imperative therefore that we have our edition of VANITY FAIR in improved form available this fall (Stein memo to Haas, 10 February 1950).   \n\nRay indicated that the 1864 edition with revisions by Thackeray should be followed. Stein believed that the text of the 1933 ML edition followed Thackeray’s original text as published in parts, 1847–48. At first he hoped that the existing plates could be used for the new ML edition. He told Ray, “Naturally I don’t want our text to be one which does not have scholarly approval. I don’t know yet whether a collation or a resetting is our solution but we will do one or the other to bring the text completely in line with the 1864 version. Because of production costs I am not sure yet that the illustrations, vignettes and initial letters can be included in as moderately priced a book as we plan to have” (Stein to Ray, 28 March 1950).   \n\nIn the end the ML reset the text (Stein to Ray, 20 June 1950) and included eight of Thackeray’s illustrations along with facsimiles of the title page of the first edition and the wrapper of one of the original monthly parts. Earlier ML printings (258.1) included the two facsimiles and three of Thackeray’s illustrations.   \n\nRay appears to have declined Stein’s suggestion that he write an introduction to *Vanity Fair* instead of *History of Henry Esmond*, and Stein offered Joseph Warren Beach \\$200 to write the introduction. Beach replied that he would take on the assignment for \\$500 but later agreed to accept the amount offered (Stein to Beach, 25 January 1950; Beach to Stein, 27 January 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 27 February 1950).   \n\nThe ML’s goal, Stein told Beach, was to produce “an inviting edition that can be enjoyed by the American student as a novel as readable today as it was a century ago” (Stein to Beach, 23 May 1950). The Note on the Text stated:   \n\n> The present Modern Library edition of *Vanity Fair* is based on the 1864 edition, which represents the final revisions made by Thackeray, and is preferable to earlier editions as representing what Thackeray considered improvements. Certain obvious misprints in the earlier and later editions have been corrected. In the case of certain doubtful readings we have followed the Oxford edition of *Vanity Fair* edited by Saintsbury in 1908, but we have not always accepted Saintsbury’s emendations. A few of Thackeray’s own full-page illustrations, of which there were some forty in all, have been included—enough to give a notion of the quaint visual aids offered the reader of what Thackeray called “these histories in their gaudy yellow covers”; but considerations of expense make it impossible to include the still more numerous sketches at the head of each chapter or set into the text.

Since it is partially autobiographical, the poignancy of *Jane Eyre* is linked to the deathless interest and the heart rending pathos of the lives of the Brontës. (*Fall 1933*)   \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published August 1933. *WR* 2 September 1933. First printing: Not ascertained.   \n\n*Jane Eyre* was the first ML book to include descriptive text about the work on the jacket flap. Descriptive text about each ML title appeared on the front panel of the jacket from May 1917 through spring 1928. For the next five years (fall 1928–July 1933) ML jackets included information about the series as a whole on the front flap but nothing specifically about individual works. Saxe Commins, who joined Random House as editor in July 1933, wrote the flap text for *Jane Eyre* and subsequently published ML titles. As jackets of older ML titles were reprinted, he provided flap text about those works as well.   \n\nSales of *Jane Eyre* increased substantially during the Second World War. There were nineteen printings between 1933 and early 1944 for a total of 37,000 copies. Of these, 10,453 copies were sold during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing *Jane Eyre* in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, just above Thackeray’s *Vanity Fair*. It sold 3,502 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Vanity Fair*, with sales of 5,390 copies, retained a solid position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.   \n\n#### 260.1b.

The collared main-strokes to the capitals, bifurcated terminals, horizontal hatching, and formalized shadow effect are characteristic of the period, although the swash forms of the capitals and the inclusion of lower-case were then exceptional” (*Manual of Decorated Typefaces*, p. 54).   \n\n#### 260.2b.

Signed: [Ernst] Reichl.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> “*Three Lives*,” says the Saturday Review, “stands as a massive doorpost in the entrance to the latest and best in American literature.” The book has had a curious history. Readers who were baffled by Gertrude Stein’s later work were afraid to tackle it. Twice it was allowed to go out of print altogether. Each time, however, enthusiastic admirers created sufficient demand to warrant new printings. The emphatic success of Miss Stein’s autobiography must finally win for this splendid book the wide audience that is its due. (*Fall 1933*)   \n\nOriginally published by Grafton Press, 1909. Reprinted by Albert & Charles Boni, 1927. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–279) printed from Grafton/Boni plates. Published September 1933. *WR* 7 October 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941.   \n\nAfter Harcourt, Brace & Co. published Stein’s *Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* in 1933, Carl Van Vechten suggested that the ML bring out some of Stein’s earlier work. Cerf cabled Stein in Paris about a ML edition of *Three* *Lives* (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 101). RH subsequently became Stein’s regular publisher, and a warm friendship developed between Cerf and Stein.   \n\nThe ML acquired the plates and full publishing rights to *Three Lives*, and Van Vechten wrote a new introduction for the ML edition. Cerf informed Stein a month after publication that “the book is proving to be a tremendous success for us. It is causing more comment than any new Modern Library title in the past two years. The firm of R. H. Macy & Co., which has probably the largest book department in the world today, has bought the astonishing number of 1300 copies of this little book since publication day less than a month ago. The total sale to date is over 4500 copies” (Cerf to Stein, 23 October 1933).   \n\nSales appear to have dropped off in the later 1930s, and *Three Lives* was discontinued at the end of 1940. Cerf persuaded James Laughlin of New Directions to add *Three Lives* to their New Classics series in 1941. New Directions used the ML’s plates, including Van Vechten’s introduction, and paid the ML a \\$250 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf told Stein that she would receive \\$125 (her half of the advance) from the New Directions edition in the next year alone (Cerf to Stein, 17 September 1941).   \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>   \nStein, *Selected Writings* (1962–1971) 547   \nStein, *Autobiography of Alice B.

The avidity with which it was read when it was first issued in 1880 has never abated, and new generations of readers, surfeited with less glamorous fare, feast on this chronicle of the first days of Christianity with increasing delight. To them, as to their elders, *Ben Hur* is a fast-moving and absorbing tale, full of the color and pageantry of Rome at the height of its glory, and packed with action and excitement. (*Fall 1933*)   \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Brothers, 1880. New bibliographical edition (“Player’s Edition”) published by Harper & Brothers, 1901.

Published October 1933. *WR* 4 November 1933. First (and probably only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1941.   \n\nCerf initially offered Harper & Bros. a \\$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated that he wanted to publish *Ben-Hur* in October 1933 so the ML could have as much time as possible to sell its edition before the work entered the public domain in 1936 (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 12 May 1933). The advance was reduced to \\$1,000 in the contract dated 17 May 1933. The small type and dated nineteenth-century typography of the “Player’s Edition” plates made *Ben-Hur* one of the least attractive volumes in the series. The ML edition was not a success; copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder marking of a star stamped on the endpaper.   \n\nThe ML omitted the hyphen from the title on the jacket, half title, title page, biographical and bibliographical note, and lists of titles in the series. Ben-Hur is hyphenated throughout the text.   \n\n",

The astonishing brilliance of Lytton Strachey’s portraits illuminated the hidden facets of his subjects as well as the motives and tendencies of the era in which they lived. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s graphic and vivacious methods, and the present-day enthusiasm for biographical literature is directly traceable to his innovating technique. Strachey himself considered *Eminent Victorians* his finest work. (*Fall 1933*)   \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by G. P.

Discontinued 1970/71.   \n\nHarcourt, Brace acquired the rights to *Eminent Victorians* after publishing Strachey’s *Queen Victoria* (1921) and *Elizabeth and Essex* (1928). When Cerf expressed interest in a Strachey title for the ML, Alfred Harcourt replied that neither *Queen Victoria* nor *Elizabeth and Essex* would be available since the firm wanted to promote them as textbooks after a reprint contracts held by Blue Ribbon Books expired. He indicated that the ML could have *Eminent Victorians* in June 1933 when the Star Dollar Books edition published by Garden City Publishing Co. would be exhausted (Harcourt to Cerf, 27 September 1932). The following April he reported that the Star edition was out of print and that *Eminent Victorians* was available whenever the ML wanted it (Harcourt to Cerf, 21 April 1933). The original plates were too large for the ML’s format and Harcourt, Brace made new plates for the ML edition, for which the ML was billed \\$500. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy.   \n\n*Eminent Victorians* sold 2,967 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles.

Of these, the most notable were his acute sense of the past, a scholarship both accurate and spirited, and a vivid style. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s graphic and vitalizing methods, and the current enthusiasm for works of biography is directly traceable to his innovations.

One by one, the independent parts are being made available for Modern Library readers, all in the masterful translations of C. K. Scott Moncrieff. . . . *The Guermantes Way* is the third of the series. These novels should be read in their proper order, that their subtlety and depth may be savored to the full. (*Fall 1933*)   \n\nOriginally published in U.S. in two volumes by Thomas Seltzer, 1925; reprinted 1928 by Albert & Charles Boni. ML edition (pp. [*7*–*9*], 1–428; 1–395) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates in one volume with part titles added and headings “Part I” and “Part II” added to the table of contents. Published December 1933. *WR* 23 December 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.   \n\nFifteen months after the ML edition of *Within a Budding Grove* (194) was published Cerf wrote to Albert Boni about adding *The Guermantes Way* to the series in fall 1931 or spring 1932 (Cerf to Boni, 17 April 1931). Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set of *Remembrance of Things Past* would be undermined if individual volumes appeared in the ML too rapidly. Cerf approached him again a few months later with an offer that he hoped would entice Boni to release the work for publication in spring 1932. He offered an advance of \\$1,500 payable immediately, or \\$2,000 with half paid on signing and the balance on publication, against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Boni, 3 July 1931). The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year and specified that the ML edition could not be published before October 1933. The ML paid Boni a \\$1,500 advance with \\$750 payable on signing (Cerf to Boni, 23 November 1932).   \n\n*Swann’s Way* (166) was the only Proust title to achieve consistently good sales in the ML. *The Guermantes Way* sold 1,997 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth worst-selling title. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\n#### 264b.

The filth and the futility of war are pitilessly revealed, but even more is it a revelation of the debasement and glory of youth. Written with a fiery imagination and the keenest sensitiveness, it is none the less a book of the most spontaneous realism, and as such holds through the years a place by itself among the few important books produced by the World War.

Cumming’s [*sic*] ‘Enormous Room’ because, in my opinion, it is one of the most over-rated books of our time” (Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, to Cerf, 18 April 1928; Cerf to Baumgarten, 21 April 1928). He later changed his mind.  \n\nCummings’s bibliographer wrote in 1960: “Cummings’ ‘Introduction’, his father’s ‘Foreword’ and the restoration, under the direct supervision of the author, of the original manuscript text makes the ‘Modern Library’ edition . . . the most authoritative edition issued to date” (Firmage, p. 5).  \n\n*The Enormous Room* sold 2,749 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles.

Signed: VA [Valenti Angelo].  \n\n> Front flap:<br> It is not without reason that *The Good Earth* has been the most successful book since *Quo Vadis*, 38 years ago. Its immense popularity can be attributed to the humanity of the people who come to life in its pages and to the Biblical simplicity of its writing. It is a book that takes root deep in the heart of mankind. *The Good Earth* is more than a mere portrayal of Oriental life; it is the epic of man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by John Day Co., 1931. ML edition (266.1, pp. [1]–[375]) printed from Day plates with battered page numeral “375” removed. Published February 1934. *WR* 10 February 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1970.  \n\nThe ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major best-seller like *The Good Earth*, which headed the best-seller list for two years (1931–32). Grosset & Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher of hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap between its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint rights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933 about a ML edition of *The Good Earth*, he was told that it would be many months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf to Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January 1933). Arrangements were made later that year for *The Good Earth* to appear first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and shortly thereafter in the ML.  \n\nBuck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long letter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies to Her Chinese Critic” in the *New York Times Book Review* (15 January 1933).  \n\nThree months after Pocket Books published *The Good Earth* as a twenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this book holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many other editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our Modern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative sales figures for the Grosset & Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for the eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following: Grosset & Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH box 141, folder D1).  \n\nSales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War, reflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced interest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n*The Good Earth* was shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML published its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.  \n\nThe ML’s reprint contract for *The Good Earth* was terminated in July 1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies. Together with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML stock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.  \n\n#### 266.1b.

(*Spring 1946*)  \n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br> The great and lasting popularity of *The Good Earth* can be attributed to the simple humanity of the people who come to life in its pages. Written in 1930, this novel brought Pearl S. Buck to the admiring attention of the world and was influential, eighteen years later, in earning for her the Nobel Prize for Literature. She was the first and only American woman so to be honored. Author of many books since *The Good Earth*, Pearl S. Buck is almost always identified with and remembered by this epic of the soil. It is a novel that has taken root and has grown in strength with the passage of the years. Far more than a portrayal of Oriental life, *The Good* *Earth* is the ever-heroic story of man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world. (*Fall 1953*)  \n\nNew bibliographical edition published by Grosset & Dunlap, 1944/45, with a new foreword by the author. ML edition printed from a duplicate set of the plates used for Grosset & Dunlap printings.  \n\nAn internal RH memo (Regina Spirito to Manny Harper, 5 May 1945) indicates that new plates were being made for *The Good Earth* along with Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage* (199), Well’s *Tono-Bungay* (225), and Maugham’s *Moon and Sixpence* (283). It is not known whether the ML made duplicates of the Grosset & Dunlap plates or whether the two sets of plates were made at the same time.  \n\nThe new typesetting replaces Buck’s introduction with a one-page foreword by Buck dated September 1944. By eliminating running heads and increasing the lines of text on each page from 31 to 37, the new typesetting reduces the length of for Buck’s text by 61 pages.  \n\nThe ML plates are identical to those used by Grosset & Dunlap with the exception of the title page, the addition of the series title and a publisher’s note to the half title, and the addition of the RH device to the verso of the title page along with the following statement within a single-rule frame: “*Random House* <span class=\"smallcaps\">is the publisher of</span> | THE MODERN LIBRARY | <span class=\"smallcaps\">bennett a. cerf</span> | <span class=\"smallcaps\">donald s. klopfer</span> | <span class=\"smallcaps\">robert k. haas</span> | Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway Printing Company Bound by H.

Yet there was neither hesitation nor reservation in the choice of *The Maltese Falcon*. Its authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition (pp. [v], [xi]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934. *WR* 31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949.  \n\nHammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people who served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite a few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your private detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my colleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp. viii–ix).  \n\n*The Maltese Falcon* was originally published as a five-part serial (September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazine *Black Mask*. “The book was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two thousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the changes were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to have been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).  \n\nThere were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and fifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (*The Maltese Falcon*, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title page verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first in the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been examined.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version starring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period. The 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears to have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued in 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950). The ML remaindered 4,774 copies through the Harlem Book Co in 1952.  \n\n#### 267b.

(*Spring 1934*) *Note:* The fourth leaf of the first gathering (pp. vii–viii) has been cancelled and replaced by a newly printed leaf; the first gathering is normal in later printings. It is not known whether the original leaf was cancelled because of a printer’s error or a last-minute revision by Caldwell.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in vivid orange (48), moderate green (145) and dark grayish brown (62) on cream paper depicting vivid orange sun rising over moderate green fields; borders in vivid orange, title in reverse on three moderate green banners, other lettering in dark grayish brown.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> When the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, through its agent, John S. Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of *God’s Little Acre* on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case, declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.” The Modern Library now adds *God’s Little Acre* to its list as a serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp. [v], [1]–[311]) printed from Viking plates, which were subsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown & Co. Published April 1934. *WR* 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nCaldwell received \\$50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf to Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:  \n\n> Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them. I hope so. (p. ix)  \n\nThe hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition was realized most fully after the introduction of mass market paperbacks. The paperback edition of *God’s Little Acre*, published in 1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by Penguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its first nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern paperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million copies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).  \n\nThe biographical note and bibliography on p. [vi] were updated at Caldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27 December 1938). The plates and publishing rights to *God’s Little Acre* were transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall 1939 and passed to Little, Brown & Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged its printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one printing under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.  \n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted that the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934 and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12 cents a copy.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total sales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to James Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).  \n\n#### 268.1b.

The dedication, biographical note and bibliography, foreword, and appendix were omitted from the new typesetting at Caldwell’s request (Eleanor Pitt, Little, Brown, to Ruth Fenichel, 5 March 1957).

This edition contains thirty-nine reproductions from the original illustrations by “Phiz” and is complete in one volume. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1934. *WR* 12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971.  \n\nPublication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May. Norris’s *The Pit* (272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed until August. Delays in production of *The Pit* appear to have been primarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date of *David Copperfield* allowed the ML to benefit from anticipated publicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’s *Life of Our Lord*, which was written for his children and published by Simon and Schuster in May 1934.  \n\n*David Copperfield* sold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and forty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series. Thackeray’s *Vanity Fair* (258) outsold *David Copperfield* at both periods, but *David Copperfield* was Dickens’s most popular title in the ML. *The Pickwick Papers* (247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely made it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52. *A Tale of Two Cities* (284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43, was low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.  \n\n#### 269b.

Instead of bothering to discover phallic parables in every casual allusion, adult readers take the keenest delight in the nimble satire of this morality in behalf of monogamy and common-sense. *Jurgen*, thanks to the obscenity seekers, has become Cabell’s best-known novel. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1919. ML edition (pp. [iii–iv], [xiii]–368) printed from McBride plates with the expanded foreword first included in the eighth McBride printing. Published July 1934. *WR* 28 July 1934. Discontinued fall 1943.  \n\n*Jurgen* was one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure after they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a \\$5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice he offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’s *Cream of the Jest* or *The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck* (Cerf to Mr. [Guy] Holt, McBride, 29 July 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition of *Beyond Life* (104) two years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint editions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained strong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition of Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).  \n\nMcBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* (131) in 1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer for *Jurgen*, but the response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12 cents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to permit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least for the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and particularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so profitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way – this despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the sale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer to Rose, 27 March 1928).  \n\nGrosset & Dunlap published a reprint edition of *Jurgen* in its Novels of Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in publishing *Jurgen* in the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker, McBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed when the Grosset & Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months later, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we can get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset & Dunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset & Dunlap wrote McBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t directly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset & Dunlap to McBride & Co., 16 November 1933).  \n\n#### 271b.

Signed: VA [Valenti Angelo].  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Frank Norris lived to complete only two-thirds of his planned trilogy, *The Epic of Wheat*. *The Pit*, which is the second volume, created a national furor and established Norris as the first and one of the greatest realists in America. Today *The Pit* is not only a startling exposé of the machinations of stock gamblers in the fundamental necessity of life, but also an authentic picture of the frenzied struggle for power that marked the end of American pioneer days and the beginnings of its ventures in world markets. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1903. New bibliographical edition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML edition (pp. [v]–403) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934. *WR* 25 August 1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 31 December 1940.  \n\nRobert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary, was inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris in *Saturday Review of Literature* (27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML edition of Norris’s *McTeague* or *The* *Octopus* three years earlier (Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff sent copies of *The Pit* and *McTeague* for his consideration. He noted that *The Pit* had sold 189,455 copies in all editions while *McTeague* had sold 67,272 copies and *The Octopus* had sold 59,779 copies (de Graff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided that *The Pit* “should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July 1933). He appears to have been unaware that *McTeague* (57) was in the ML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni & Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.  \n\nThe plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition of *The Pit* were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would have to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would share the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think, making some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.). Meanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original plates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the Modern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios in small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty bad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you think, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent looking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing Co., 29 August 1933).  \n\nPublication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed until August; Dickens’s *David Copperfield* (269), originally scheduled for August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production of *The Pit* appears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end of April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to use” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was made to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928 Argonaut edition. *The Pit* appears to have been the first ML title printed by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but it would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and make new letterpress plates.  \n\nSales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing. *The Pit* was discontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first ML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nNorris, *McTeague* (1918–1922) 57  \n\n",

Signed: Newman.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> *The Great Gatsby* is a story of the fabulous 1920s, that incredible period in American history that ended in a crash from which we are all reeling still. The editors of *Time* Magazine report that Gatsby was the “first racketeer in United States fiction.” Countless novels and motion pictures have followed the pattern since, but *The Great Gatsby* remains the most brilliant and understanding portrait of the first mad days of the bootleg era. It is by all odds Scott Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the development of American literature can afford to overlook. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934. *WR* 29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939.  \n\nMaxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML edition of *The Great Gatsby*. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to announce the forthcoming publication of *Tender Is the Night*, which appeared initially as a serial in *Scribner’s Magazine*, and added: “If it goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why don’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by Gertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter of *The Great Gatsby* and wrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it had brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was “creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see Tanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted to publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald \\$50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934). Including his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of \\$300 from the ML edition.  \n\nFitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our series” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf about the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off writing it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of the approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week. He appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs of the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the corrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the introduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).  \n\nThe ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original introductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni & Liveright era, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction to *South Wind* (114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition of *Mrs. Dalloway* (168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of this genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction to *The Great Gatsby* was one of the worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future printings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like the preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and incoherance [*sic*], two qualities which the story that succeeds it manages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to reassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to Fitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared, “The preface *is* incoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but simply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).  \n\nA 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is inscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in Tryon [North Carolina]” with the additional annotation at the top of p. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington, London; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the ML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of Maxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s own hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv &lt;modlib@thuban.owu.edu&gt;, 10 November 2011).  \n\n*Tender Is the Night*, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published in April 1934, five months before the ML edition of *The Great Gatsby*. By 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent Cerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition of *Tender Is the Night* if he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now are essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the correspondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the preceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he wrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity . . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than one in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads them to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell Perkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishing *This Side of Paradise,* *The Great Gatsby*, and *Tender Is the Night* as an omnibus volume in the ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli, *Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald*, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).  \n\nSales of *The Great Gatsby* were disappointing. The ML edition sold about 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal enthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest sellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott Fitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, 31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By the early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition of *The Great Gatsby* was selling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).  \n\nThere was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 after *The Great Gatsby* was discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are stamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as remainders.  \n\n",

Veblen’s examination of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on pecuniary culture is one of the masterly critiques of our socio-economic development. The new point of view and method elaborated by Veblen riddled the whole structure of economics as a pseudo-social science and created instead an entirely original set of economic categories, based on changing industrial conditions rather than an inflexible system formulated from so-called eternal principles. \n> Its irony, its rich accumulation of evidence and, above all, its boldness of interpretation have kept *The Theory of the Leisure Class* a vital work through the years.  \n\n",

Heywood Broun calls it “the most moving and admirable book about Southern Negroes that I have ever read.” (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by George H. Doran Co., 1925. ML edition (pp. [5]–196) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates, including the decorative line drawings by Theodore Nadejen. Published October 1934. *WR* 10 November 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941.  \n\nThe inclusion of *Porgy* in the ML was inspired by the forthcoming production of Gershwin’s *Porgy and Bess*. The *PW* advertisement announcing the ML’s fall 1934 list stated, “The Theatre Guild production of ‘Porgy’ this Fall, with George Gershwin music, will center new attention on this book” (*PW*, 11 August 1934, p. 407). The Theatre Guild had hoped that *Porgy and Bess* would be ready for the fall 1934 season (Alpert, p. 78), but the premier was delayed until October 1935, a full year after the appearance of the ML edition.  \n\n",

The original publishers wisely issued it in a picture wrapper without a single word of description, and let the public discover its beauties for itself. Canadian in setting, this haunting story, written by a French wanderer, has gone far beyond the boundaries of America, and has become one of the treasures of the world’s narrative literature. Did you enjoy *Green Mansions*? Try *Maria Chapdelaine*, then! (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nBlake translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1921, with large initials in blue at the beginning of each chapter. Reprinted with drawings by Wilfred Jones, 1924, using the original text plates and a second set of plates containing illustrations and different large initials printed in grayish yellow. Reprinted with introduction and notes by Carl Y. Connor in Macmillan’s Modern Readers’ Series, 1929, with large initials from the illustrated edition added to the text plates to allow for one-color printing and illustrations omitted. ML edition (pp. [xix]–288) printed from Modern Readers’ Series plates with Connor introduction and notes omitted. Published November 1934. *WR* 1 December 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.  \n\nKlopfer offered 8 cents a copy for *Maria Chapedelaine* in 1926 with an advance of \\$400 against the first 5,000 copies, but Macmillan was planning to include it in their Modern Readers series (Klopfer to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 5 October 1926). In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon Phelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to all of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we could sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell themselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML paid Macmillan a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada.  \n\nThe ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used for Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some arrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML edition in that format (David Mason, Fine & Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN; undated.)  \n\n*Maria Chapdelaine* sold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title. In 1952, two years after the ML edition was discontinued, 3,494 copies were remaindered through the Harlem Book Co.  \n\n#### 276b.

Cerf wrote Kronenberger in 1932 and 1933 asking when the anthology would be ready. When Kronenberger indicated in November 1933 that he would deliver the manuscript the following week, Cerf replied: “The Board of Directors of the Modern Library has passed a resolution unanimously to the effect that the Anthology will be much more welcome in this dignified sanctum than the compiler thereof. The book had better be good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933).

Published February 1935. *WR* 9 March 1935. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1951.   \n\nThe ML paid Knopf a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The ML secured reprint rights in December 1934 after offers in 1932 and 1933 had been rejected. Cerf told Knopf that *Growth of the Soil* would make a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he exclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!” (Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when the ML increased the list price to \\$1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947). *Growth of the Soil* sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.   \n\n#### 279b.

John Reed wrote this eyewitness account of the Bolshevik Revolution as reportage, as personal history, as propaganda, but also as raw history. Published in 1919, and written before the rise of an official Communist version of these events (Trotsky here still stands beside Lenin, and Stalin is nowhere to be found), it still retains its value as history; but more important than this, it helped create an image, a myth, of the Bolshevik Revolution which was enormously influential in America, in other countries where the book was widely circulated, and in Communist Russia itself, where it was translated by Lenin’s wife and introduced enthusiastically by Lenin. \n> The present edition of *Ten Days That Shook the World* has a new introduction by Bertram D. Wolfe, author of *Three Who Made a Revolution*, which relates this important work to our current knowledge of the Russian Revolution. (*Fall 1960*)  \n\nPrinted from newly set plates that were also used for a paperback edition in Vintage Books. Vintage and ML editions published fall 1960.  \n\nThe plates used for 280.1 had become badly worn when the ML decided to bring out a new edition. Wolfe received \\$1,000 for his introduction. Reed’s notes were shifted from the appendix to the end of each chapter. Wolfe suggested the addition of an index.  \n\n",

The glowing beauty of her work, its insight, its vividness and lyrical flow give to this chronicle of the American soil a distinction shared by few novels of our time.

So I made terms with my conscience and my publisher: ‘If you’ll let me off revising I’ll write an introduction instead; that will only take a few hours, the other would take weeks’” (p. vii). *Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems* sold 2,403 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the bottom quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.  \n\n#### 282b.

Freiman contacted Doubleday, Doran to determine whether it was willing to supply new plates or at least pay part of the cost (Freiman memo to Haas, 13 November 1944). Doubleday, Doran agreed to reset and replate both titles at its own expense as long as the ML agreed to keep them in print and promote them aggressively for at least ten years (Cedric R. Crowell, Doubleday, Doran, to Commins, 2 January 1945). The new plates were delivered to the ML’s printers in December 1945. The ML instructed Parkway Printing Co. to dispose of the old plates and use the new ones for all future printings (Regina Spirito to Bill Simon, Parkway Printing, 13 December 1945).

(*Spring 1952*)  \n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br> It is now almost a full century since *A Tale of Two Cities* was published, yet it still stands as one of the best of all the historical novels written during that time. New generations of readers have obtained their first understanding of the meaning of the French Revolution as a social cataclysm and a human drama from the pages of this novel. They have participated in its blood-stirring events not by following the career of notable and spectacular personages, but by identifying themselves with Sydney Carton, the Defarges and the other obscure people who lived and died during the reign of terror. (*Fall 1953*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial on coated white paper with multicolored illustration of a public execution with the severed head of a guillotined man being held aloft to a crowd of soldiers and others; lettering in black. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A rewritten text. (*Spring 1956*)  \n\nWagenknecht received \\$150 for the introduction (Stein to Wagenknecht, 24 January 1950). Despite the addition of the new introduction and bibliography, the number of leaves is identical to 284b. This was accomplished by omitting the biographical note (which was superseded by the new introduction), the first part title (which was added at the head of chapter 1 and mysteriously appears as well at the head of the title page), and the ML lists at the end of the book. In addition, pp. 395–96 were adjusted with minor resetting to accommodate the last three lines of text that appeared on p. 397 in earlier printings.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library:</span>\nDickens, *Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club*(1930-1970) 247; (Illus ML, 1943-1951) IML 4\nDickens, *David Copperfield* (1934-1971) 269\nDickens, *Our Mutual Friend* (1960-1970) 524\nDickens, *Bleak House* (1985- ) 641\n\n",

His fame rests chiefly on two novels, *The Magic Mountain* and *Buddenbrooks*. For more than three years, *The Magic Mountain* (#200) has maintained its position as one of the five best sellers on the Modern Library list. With the addition of *Buddenbrooks* to the series, it is safe to predict that it will take rank with its illustrious predecessor as a book of immense popular appeal. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nLowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Alfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. [*7*]–389; [1]–359) printed from Knopf plates. Published October 1935. *WR* 2 November 1935. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.  \n\nThe ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third printings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The reprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an eighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a \\$1,200 advance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining copies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of Knopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies (or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing under the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML reported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the bindery and that *Buddenbrooks* would be completely out of stock within a few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty statement in February 1941 indicated a payment of \\$70.92, reflecting sales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nMann, *Magic Mountain* (1932-1938) 229\nMann, *Stories of Three Decades* (Giant, 1961-1973; 1979-1986) G97\nMann, *Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man* (1965-1971) 577\nMann, *Doctor Faustus* (1966- ) 582\n\n",

As a play, a musical comedy, a weekly radio feature for three years, and, in its latest version, an operatic film, *Show Boat*, like the river it celebrates, rolls on forever. Now in the Modern Library series, Edna Ferber’s famous chronicle of the Mississippi summons a new audience to Captain Andy Hawks’ floating palace of entertainment. Jerome Kern, the well-known composer, provides a foreword. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1926.

Cerf replied that nothing could be done during the coming season. “Our Fall Modern Library list already includes THE GREAT GATSBY, PORGY, and LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL, and that is more than enough Americana for this one installment!” (Cerf to Longwell, 9 April 1934). *Show Boat* appeared in the ML the following year and was discontinued five years later. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.  \n\n",

Edward Newton in the most fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* made it the unanimous choice of the editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to be welcomed into the series. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\nOriginally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression published by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. [*7*], [*16*]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a black-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the Atlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and printed with the text. Published December 1935. *WR* 14 December 1935. First printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was still selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24 August 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just returned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we had a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that time I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library edition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to you and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about it” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he would be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25 February 1935).  \n\nThe Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf initially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he wanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of \\$750 against royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay only 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after which the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think that Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure that every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale of at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the book is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the pages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).  \n\nCerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the \\$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset “would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result may not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough to suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The Polygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of \\$792 for making the plates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented \\$400 for plate work, including all halftones, and \\$392 for press work. The cost of reprints (make-ready and press work) was quoted as \\$296 for 5,000 copies or \\$408 for 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).  \n\nNewton received \\$50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf invited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant not only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but special attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words, the new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new review of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to Newton, 25 April 1935). ",

The actual murder of a member of a revolutionary circle by his fellow conspirators first gave Dostoyevsky the idea for the book in which he turned against the radicals and socialists with whom he had earlier identified. As Avrahm Yarmolinsky observes in his Foreword, “*The Possessed* testifies to the fact that Dostoyevsky was not without some insight into the nature of the upheaval from which he was separated by nearly half a century.” Revolution, however, is not the sole theme of this novel, rich in insight, imaginative power and strongly drawn characters, which ranks with Dostoyevsky’s major works.  \n\nPublished fall 1977 at \\$6.95.

Of the score of distinguished books from her pen, none so completely reveals her powers as a novelist. None depicts so poignantly and unforgettably the social history of the South.

During that time it has made a permanent place for itself in the world’s literature beside such books as *Gulliver’s Travels* and *Don Quixote*. To the Russian, whatever his political allegiance may be, *Dead Souls* is more than a satire that flays the weakness of the Slavic character; it is the enduring symbol of a people that neither tyranny nor revolution can change. Gogol’s masterpiece lends new distinction to the Modern Library list. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nConstance Garnett translation originally published in U.S. as vols. 1–2 of *The Collected Works of Nikolay Gogol* by Alfred A. Knopf, 1923. ML edition (290.1, pp. [7]–275; [5]–265) printed from Knopf plates with page numerals removed from translator’s preface. Published March 1936. *WR* 28 March 1936. First printing: 5,000 copies. Superseded 1965 by Guerney translation (290.2).  \n\nHerschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co., asked in 1931 why *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead Souls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to it. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf, undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). The ML edition was published five years later.  \n\nThe ML edition (290.1) was translated by Constance Garnett. Garnett was named on the title page of other classics of Russian literature published in the ML before the 1960s. The only clue to the translator’s identity in *Dead Souls* is the copyright notice on the verso of the title page, where she is identified as “Mrs. Edward Garnett.” Odets received \\$50 for the introduction (Cerf to Odets, 16 January 1936).  \n\n*Dead Souls* sold 3,557 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.

Confronted with an embarrassment of riches in making a choice among so many novels, this selection was made because it most completely embodies the spirit and substance of Henry James’ unique gifts. The recognition given him by discriminating readers during the last part of the nineteenth century promises to be renewed in the twentieth. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1881. ML edition (291.1, pp. [*7*]–[428]; [*1*]–[438]) printed from Houghton Mifflin plates. Published April 1936. *WR* 25 April 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissued 1983.  \n\nWhen *Daisy Miller & An International Episode* (60) was discontinued in 1934, the ML was left with a single James volume, *Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* (189). Klopfer then contacted Houghton Mifflin: “It occurred to me that it is just about time for us to get a decent Henry James title in the Modern Library.” He expressed interest in *The Portrait of a Lady* or *The Tragic Muse* provided the plates fit the ML’s format and offered royalties of 10 cents a copy (Klopfer to Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 6 June 1934). Linscott replied that nothing could be done for a year. Houghton Mifflin had just concluded “a long and difficult negotiation” with the James family to bring out a less expensive edition of *The Portrait of a Lady*, and Ferris Greenslet, general manager of the trade department, did not want to undertake another campaign just then (Linscott to Klopfer, 11 June 1934).  \n\nThree years after the ML edition was published, Linscott showed Klopfer the Houghton Mifflin sales figures for *The Portrait of a Lady* for the preceding twelve years (Linscott to Klopfer, 23 May 1939). The figures illustrate the effect of the ML edition on sales of the original publisher’s edition: 510 copies (1927), 509 copies (1928), 400 copies (1929), 402 copies (1930), 309 copies (1931), 192 copies (1932), 112 copies (1933), 155 copies (1934), 158 copies (1935), 93 copies (1936, when the ML edition appeared), 82 copies (1937), 89 copies (1938).  \n\n*The Portrait of a Lady* sold 4,308 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales increased by the early 1950s. It sold 5,345 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it thirty-ninth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.  \n\n#### 291.1b.

Stein offered Millett \\$200 to write an introduction of 3,000–5,000 words (Stein to Millett, 28 June 1950). Millett submitted an essay two-and-a-half times the length requested and indicated that Stein could cut it (Millett to Stein, 3 October 1950). The first part was a sketch of James’s life and works, the second part provided an account of the writing of the novel and James’s opinion of it at various times, and the third part consisted of a critical discussion of the work in light of James’s own criteria and the expectations of the modern reader. Both Stein and Linscott (who had moved to RH from Houghton Mifflin in 1944) were enthusiastic about the introduction but thought it had to be cut. Stein suggested leaving part 3 largely as it stood, cutting part 1 from 3,000 to 1,000 words, and eliminating most of part 2. He urged Millett to publish the entire essay in a journal like *Kenyon Review* or *Sewanee Review* (Millett to Stein, 3 October 1950; Millett to Stein 12 October 1950; Stein to Millett, 25 October 1950).  \n\nMillett does not appear to have published the complete version of his essay. His introduction to the ML edition is the only entry by Millett recorded in Marion Richmond, “Henry James’s *The Portrait of a Lady*: A Bibliography of Primary Material and Annotated Criticism,” *Henry James Review* 7 (Winter–Spring 1986, pp. 164–195).  \n\n#### 291.2a.

Leavis as the greatest achievement in the whole of James’s work, *The Portrait of a Lady* explores a theme and moral dilemma that captivated James’s imagination: the perilous allure of the older European civilization and its impact on the American character. Through the finely drawn figure of Isabel Archer, “a certain young woman affronting her destiny” in Europe, and his mastery of interpersonal relationships to objectify her maturing moral sense, James has produced a triumph of psychological realism that fulfills his own demands of the art form by being both “interesting” and “amusing.” In an exquisite prose style—sensitive, subtle, and perfectly controlled—*The Portrait of a Lady* is one of the most enduring representations of women in Western literature, and ranks as one of the finest novels written in the English language. \n> *The Portrait of a Lady* was first published in 1881.

Signed: illegible.  \n\n> Front flap: <br> The only quarrel among Trollope enthusiasts revolves around the preference between *Barchester Towers* and *The Warden*. The editors of the Modern Library serve both factions by including the two novels in a single volume, not so much to placate the embattled Trollopians, but because *Barchester Towers* is, by the author’s own intention, inseparable from *The Warden*, and is its sequel. A. Edward Newton, author of *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* and founder of The Trollope Society, contributes a glowing introduction to this volume. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1936. *WR* 16 May 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nCerf wrote to Newton after the announcement of ML’s spring list: “I am amazed and delighted at the interest that has been evinced at the mere announcement of the first Trollope title in our Modern Library series. We have announced the book for May publication, but it seems if we can get it ready five or six weeks before that time, we may be able to bag a few big school orders for the book. Accordingly, I would esteem it a tremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in the course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of February. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get all the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January 1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML edition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date of the 25th of the month.  \n\nThe Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily accessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped that an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It appeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER TOWERS are published under the patronage of <span class=\"smallcaps\">The Trollope Society</span>” (p. [iv]). Klopfer expressed the hope that the ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer to Newton, 12 March 1936). But sales were disappointing and no further works by Trollope were added to the series until *The Way We Live Now* (639) appeared in 1984.  \n\n*Barchester Towers & The Warden* sold 3,196 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 292b.

Haight declined on the grounds that he didn’t have time, but he strongly urged that George Eliot’s *Middlemarch* be added to the ML and indicated that he would write an introduction to that (Haight to Stein, 26 January 1950). Haight suggested that Stein contact his colleague Chauncey B. Tinker, but Tinker also declined, as did Mary Ellen Chase (Stein to Tinker, 26 January 1950; Tinker to Stein, 27 January 1950; Stein to Chase, 27 January 1950).

The translations were chosen for their fidelity and for their retention of the gay and ebullient spirit of Quintus Horatius Flaccus. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published June 1936. *WR* 27 June 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nKraemer, a professor at New York University, proposed the Horace volume. He asked for an advance of \\$100 and royalties at the standard sliding scale for trade books of 10 to 15 percent (Kraemer to Cerf, 20 June 1935). Cerf agreed to the advance but indicated that the ML could only pay royalties of 5 percent (Cerf to Kraemer, 25 June 1935). Kraemer accepted these terms. *The Complete Works of Horace* reprinted 29 pages from *Horace and English Verse* translated by Alexander Murison, which was copyrighted by Longmans, Green & Co. in the British Empire but not in the United States. Cerf requested permission to use the material, but Longmans, Green wanted a fee of twenty guineas. This was more than Cerf was prepared to pay, so the ML used the material without permission. He told Longmans, Green that the ML would confine distribution to the United States and Canada. Longmans, Green asked its Canadian office to stop imports into Canada. T. F. Pike of the Longmans, Green Toronto office wrote to Hugh Eayrs of the Macmillan Co. of Canada, the ML’s Canadian distributors, so that he could “advise London my duty has been done” (Pike to Eayrs, 30 November 1936). Eayrs passed his letter along to Cerf.  \n\n*The Complete Works of Horace* sold 2,730 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 44,171 copies by spring 1958.  \n\n#### 293b.

Signed: Cassens.  \n\n> Front flap: <br> No writer of our time has so vividly dramatized the living spirit of revolution, nor so completely identified himself with the struggle for a new social order as André Malraux. *Man’s Fate*, dealing with the 1925–1927 uprising in China, is, indeed, more than a novel of the fierce conflicts that tore a vast country asunder; it is a revelation of man’s courage and heroism in the face of imminent annihilation. Winner of the Goncourt Prize for 1933, *Man’s Fate* established André Malraux as one of the leading novelists of France and the world. (*Fall 1936*)  \n\nChevalier translation originally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934, two years before Random House acquired the firm. ML edition (294a, pp. [*7*]–360) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Smith and Haas edition with page numerals “v–vi” removed from contents pages; 294b–c (pp. v–360) printed letterpress from Smith and Haas/RH plates; 294d printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Smith and Haas edition. Published September 1936. *WR* 26 September 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74. Published in Vintage Books, February 1969.  \n\n*Man’s Fate* was the first Smith and Haas title added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer absorbed the firm in April 1936.  \n\nThe Smith and Haas edition measured 8⅜ x 5¾ inches with a type page of 6⅜ by 3⅝ inches. The plates were far too large for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch format. To include *Man’s Fate* in the series the ML would either have to reset the text and make new letterpress plates or photograph a clean copy of the Smith and Haas edition, reduce the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography. The quality of offset lithographic printing in the 1930s was inferior to letterpress and the cost of each print run was higher, but photographing an existing book was significantly cheaper than making a new typesetting. There were at least two printings of 294a from offset plates, including a September 1939 printing of 3,000 copies.  \n\nThe introduction of the larger ML format in fall 1939 made it possible, with uncomfortably narrow margins, to use the original letterpress plates for subsequent ML printings (294b–c). With a top margin that averaged about ¼ in. (6 mm), letterpress printings in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s were not examples of fine bookmaking. The ML reverted to offset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing dropped below that of letterpress. *Man’s Fate* is the only ML title to have been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress, and again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are photographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making printings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of comfortable margins and freshness of the type.  \n\nThe ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or to Gallimard, the French publisher of *La Condition humaine*.  \n\n*Man’s Fate* sold 3,376 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Man’s Hope* (G56), Malraux’s other novel in the ML, sold 2,143 copies during the same period. *Man’s Fate* did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 294b.

(*Fall 1960*)  \n\nChevalier’s introduction was written for the Smith and Haas edition. Its rhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the 1950s:  \n\n> In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks, no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading, working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .\n > There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3) \n > Those of us who demand this can now point to *Man’s Fate* and say: ‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).  \n\nChevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer hearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it was made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the hearings.  \n\n#### 294d.

Both were acclaimed by discriminating critics but at first met with an apathetic public response. Years later they came into their own as two of the most popular novels of our time. Today *Maurice Guest* is ranked, among musical novels, with *Jean Christophe* and *Evelyn Innes*, and has grown so steadily in esteem that it is surpassing Henry Handel Richardson’s best-selling novel, *Ultima Thule*. (*Fall 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by P. R. Reynolds, 1908, and Duffield & Co., 1909, probably using printed sheets or duplicate plates of the English edition published by William Heinemann, 1908. New bibliographical edition published by W. W. Norton & Co., 1930. ML edition (pp. [1]–566) printed from Norton plates. Published October 1936. *WR* 31 October 1936. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.  \n\nA ML edition of *Maurice Guest* was suggested by at least two people. The ML’s traveler for the Middle West passed along a bookseller’s suggestion for the novel (James L. Crowder to Cerf, 1 October 1934), and W. W. Norton appears to have suggested a ML reprint. Cerf expressed reservations about its sales potential: “May I ask you on what terms you will be prepared to let us publish MAURICE GUEST in the Modern Library this Fall? I agree with you that it is a fine book, but am a little doubtful as to just how big a seller it would be” (Cerf to Walter Norton, W. W. Norton & Co., 2 January 1936).  \n\nHenry Handel Richardson was the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson. Commins identified the author as Henrietta Richardson in the first draft of his biographical note and indicated that “Handel” had been taken from the name of the composer. Norton asked Cerf to omit the reference since neither Norton nor Heinemann, her English publisher, had ever made Richardson’s identity public. He also pointed out that she had been married for over thirty years to an important figure in English letters (the philologist John George Robertson) and was no longer Miss Richardson (Norton to Cerf, 28 July 1936). Commins left in the reference to “Miss Richardson” but omitted information about to her real name.  \n\nThe ML edition was not a success. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.  \n\n",

Conversion, repentance, mysticism, hopes of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter are studied with boldness, sympathy and the unbiased common sense of science. The result is a book that has become a living force in religious literature, for believer and non-believer alike, and has contributed to maintain William James’s status as the greatest American philosopher. (*Fall 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published in New York and London by Longmans, Green & Co., 1902. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1936. *WR* 21 November 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.  \n\nThe ML paid Longmans, Green an advance of \\$500. The ML’s reprint rights were limited to the U.S. since Longmans, Green in London retained rights to the Canadian market (Klopfer to Walter Jefferay, Longmans, Green, 26 May 1936). The original royalty rate has not been ascertained but was probably 10 cents a copy. In 1958, shortly before *The Varieties of Religious Experience* entered the public domain, Klopfer inquired whether a reduction in royalties would be appropriate (Klopfer to Longmans, Green, 14 February 1958). In 1970 the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.  \n\n*The Varieties of Religious Experience* sold 6,519 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It ranked in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 with sales of 5,390 copies. *The Philosophy of William James* (119) did not sell as well as *The Varieties of Religious Experience*. It sold 5,378 copies during the 1942–43 period, placing it near the bottom of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during 1951–52.  \n\n#### 296b.

Such writers as Balzac, Nietzsche, Zola, Dowden, André Gide and Lytton Strachey acclaimed it. *The Charterhouse of Parma* finds a distinguished place in the Modern Library series. With *The Red and the Black* (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (*Fall 1936*)   \n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni & Liveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of *The Works of Stendhal*.

Discontinued fall 1943.   \n\nArthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to secure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the reprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an introduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured Cerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to Cerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline; *The Charterhouse of Parma* went to press without an introduction, and sales were disappointing.   \n\nTotal printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March 1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold copies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth format, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in the larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information about Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears under “General” in the chapter for 1939.)   \n\nWartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading matter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to drop *The Charterhouse of Parma*, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to other titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in fall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among academics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by George Mayberry in the *New Republic* (8 November 1943, p. 661):   \n\n> An Open Letter \n> The Modern Library, Inc., \n> New York City. \n\n> Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August 15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for comment. \n> One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed. \n> You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness. \n> May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up remaindered copies at Macy’s. \n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">George Mayberry</span>   \n\nCerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by Mayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,” *New Republic*, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):   \n\n> Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma” from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken? \n> The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in 1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year, when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for somewhere between four and five years. [*This statement was not strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time*.] \n> May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial period in actual sales. \n> Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s “The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library. Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The Charterhouse of Parma.” \n> BENNETT A. CERF   \n\nMayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:   \n\n> [I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep “such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the Modern Library. —G.M.]   \n\nIntellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation of *The Charterhouse of Parma* became a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little magazine *Pharos* published a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry Levin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the publishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against their country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s masterpiece *The Charterhouse of Parma* because they thought they were unable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature as *Life with Father* and *Rebecca*” (*Pharos*, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).   \n\nLevin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which consisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”: “. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English, in spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in America, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal has received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).   \n\nJames T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization of publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in recent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their stock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing? Some Observations on the Future of Books,” *New Directions* 9, 1946, p. 13).   \n\nWhen Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality” or “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a claim to the intellectual audience by making *The Charterhouse of Parma* his first title.   \n\nIn 1999, fifty-six years after *The Charterhouse of Parma* was discontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by Richard Howard. That edition, in paperback, was in print as of 2016.   \n\n#### 298b. Title page reset (1940)   \n\nTHE | CHARTERHOUSE | OF PARMA | BY STENDHAL | (HENRI BEYLE) | WITH A STUDY OF M.

What are the effects? Ferdinand Lundberg’s factual biography reveals, with unchallengeable documents, the record of a life without parallel in our time. Now his book appears, complete and unabridged, in the Modern Library series, with a new foreword that includes what has occurred between the date of the last edition and the moment of going to press. (*Spring 1937*)   \n\nOriginally published by Equinox Cooperative Press, 1936.

Published February 1937. *WR* 27 February 1937. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1942.   \n\nThe ML paid Equinox Cooperative Press royalties of 10 cents a copy. Heywood Broun, to whom the book is dedicated, agreed to write an introduction to the ML edition but does not appear to have submitted it. In the end Lundberg wrote the introduction himself, updating the work with an account of Hearst’s activities from June 1936 to January 1937. The Appendix (pp. 391–92), which discusses Al Capone’s influence in calling off a threatened strike by the *Chicago Tribune*’s drivers and provides additional information about the American Metal Co., does not appear in the Equinox edition.   \n\nThe ML edition was printed by the Polygraphic Co. of America following the specifications for its offset printing of Newton, *Amenities of Book-Collecting* (287). The plates cost \\$245; presswork for 6,000 copies was \\$294 (C. J. Herold, Polygraphic Co. of America, to Commins, 30 December 1936).   \n\nThere were two additional printings of 5,000 copies (April 1937) and 2,000 copies (September 1939). Like other ML titles printed from offset plates at this period, the *First Modern Library Edition* statement (p. [ii]) is retained in later printings. The three ML printings can be distinguished by the list of titles printed inside the jackets: spring 1937 (246 titles); fall 1939 (265 titles).   \n\n",

Despised as a weakling and considered an idiot because of his physical infirmities, Claudius survived the intrigues and poisonings of the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and the mad Caligula to become emperor in A.D. 41. *I, Claudius*, written in the form of Claudius’ autobiography, unfolds a panorama of startling events in this scandalous era. Violence, blasphemy, incest, black magic and vice flourish with a fine disdain for the good opinion of history in a book that is one of the classics of modern fiction, and the best fictional reconstruction of Rome ever written.   \n\nNew typesetting originally made for Vintage Books, 1961.

Unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> To judge by the avalanche of biographies, memoirs and critical works which have appeared since his death, no writer of our time has had a more profound influence on his contemporaries than D. H. Lawrence. Among his own novels, *Sons and Lovers* (No. 109) and *The Rainbow* (No. 128) have maintained his reputation as the grand inquisitor into the dark labyrinths of the human soul. Now *Women in Love* takes its place by their side in the Modern Library series as the third of his novels dealing with the physical and mystical urgency of love. (*Spring 1937*)   \n\nOriginally published in New York by Thomas Seltzer in a “privately printed” edition of 1250 copies for subscribers only, with 50 copies signed by Lawrence, 1920. Trade edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, published in U.S. by Seltzer, 1922; publishing rights and plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [xi]–548) printed from Seltzer/Viking plates. Published April 1937. *WR* 24 April 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.   \n\nLawrence’s foreword was originally published in 1920 as an advertising leaflet for Seltzer’s first printing of *Women in Love* (Roberts, p. 39). The acknowledgment on p. [v] of the ML edition states, “The manuscript of the Foreword for this volume is in the possession of the Stanford University Library. It is published here by courtesy of Gelber, Lilienthal, Inc., of San Francisco.”   \n\n*Women in Love* sold 4,736 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the same period the ML editions of *Sons and Lovers* (99) and *The Rainbow* (138) sold 6,808 copies and 3,565 copies respectively. *Women in Love* sold 3,313 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it ninety-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.   \n\n#### 302b.

(*Spring 1946*)   \n\n> Front flap revised:<br> During his brief but stormy and prolific writing career and in the years following his death in 1930, D. H. Lawrence stirred up many fierce literary controversies. An avalanche of biographies, memoirs and critical works showed how much partisanship and antagonism he inspired among his contemporaries. Now, in the perspective of a quarter of a century, three of his novels, *Sons and Lovers* (No. 109), *The Rainbow* (No. 128) and *Women in Love* (No. 68), offer the best testimony to clarify his position as a writer who explored the darker labyrinths of the human soul. *Women in Love*, particularly, is characteristic of Lawrence’s work dealing with the physical and mystical urgency of love.

Many critics in fact believe that it is the most profound investigation of his lifelong preoccupation with the relationships between the sexes and between man and nature. The story of two sisters, Ursula and Gudrun, and their love affairs with Birkin and Gerald, it contrasts the two relationships—Gudrun and Gerald’s, which is icy, sterile and doomed; and Ursula and Birkin’s, which is fruitful and transcendent.   \n\nPublished fall 1977 at \\$5.95.

Designed by Paul Galdone, July 1937; unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> Long before *Of Mice and Men* became a best-seller and thrust its author into the national limelight, John Steinbeck had built a solid reputation upon his novel, *Tortilla Flat*. This carefree tale of the exploits of three lovable rogues won the unanimous praise of critics and reading public alike. Now it is included in the Modern Library series, partly as a tribute to the novel’s own enchantment and partly because John Steinbeck has earned the right to a place in a library of the foremost writers of our time. (*Fall 1937*)   \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Covici, Friede, 1935; publishing rights and plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. v–[317]) printed from Covici, Friede (later Covici, Friede/Viking) plates. Published September 1937. *WR* 25 September 1937. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.   \n\nSteinbeck’s foreword begins: “When this book was written, it did not occur to me that paisanos were curious or quaint, dispossessed or underdoggish. They are people whom I know and like, people who merge successfully with their habitat. . . . Had I known that these stories and these people would be considered quaint, I think I never should have written them” (p. [i]). When he submitted the foreword he told Cerf, “It is the only thing I want to say. If it won’t do—throw it out and have someone else do it. This is not a clever introduction” (Steinbeck to Cerf, undated but probably June 1937). He also asked that the ML edition be dedicated to Susan Gregory of Monterey. The dedication was retained in later Viking printings.   \n\nSubsequent printings of the ML edition include the following: 3,000 copies (August 1938); 3,000 copies (July 1939); 5,000 copies (December 1939); 2,000 copies (July 1941); 6,000 copies (December 1942). *Tortilla Flat* sold 13,432 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the fourth best-selling title in the regular series and thirteenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. The unusually strong sales of *Tortilla Flat* at this period may have been stimulated by the release of the 1942 film version starring Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr.   \n\nDuring the same period *The Grapes of Wrath* (341) ranked in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 9,495 copies. *Of Mice and Men* (311) and *In Dubious Battle* (322) were in the second quarter with sales of 7,020 copies and 6,028 copies respectively. By the early 1950s (November 1951–October 1952) *The Grapes of Wrath* was the only Steinbeck title among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.   \n\n#### 304b.

He was disturbed by the response to this portrait of a group of carefree *paisanos* in a Monterey slum, writing two years later that “I shall never again subject to the vulgar touch of the *decent* these good people of laughter and kindness, of honest lusts and direct eyes, of courtesy beyond politeness.” If today, Steinbeck’s own view of Danny and his friends seems to some shallow and condescending, that is a measure of the time in which he wrote and the impact of his writing on the change in our attitudes. Steinbeck tells this story with warmth and liveliness, and it remains a document of a period when even this glimpse of a different slice of life could be considered shocking.   \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>   \nSteinbeck, *Of Mice and Men* (1938– ) 311   \nSteinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* (1939–1971) 322   \nSteinbeck, *Grapes of Wrath* (1941–1959) 341   \n\n",

When the ML edition was announced, Robert Linscott of Houghton Mifflin told Klopfer that his firm was “rather daunted” by the news. Houghton Mifflin had thought that the ML was giving up its collection and would have abandoned *The Works of Thoreau*, an 872-page volume edited by Henry Seidel Canby, if it had known the ML was going ahead. The Houghton Mifflin collection included selections from Thoreau’s journals, which were still protected by copyright and had not been available to the ML. Linscott offered to lease the plates of Canby’s volume to the ML within eighteen months if the ML gave up its volume (Linscott to Klopfer, 7 July 1937). Klopfer replied that the ML had changed its plans as much as it could when the conflict was discovered and expressed the hope that the two books would not interfere with each other (Klopfer to Linscott, 8 July 1937).   \n\nWhen the Viking Portable Thoreau appeared in 1949, Brooks Atkinson told Cerf that it was “such a good job that your Modern Library Thoreau volume is behind the eight-ball.” He suggested replacing the selections from *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers* on pp. 301–436 with the complete work (Atkinson to Cerf, 4 March 1949). Commins replied that he hoped Atkinson would allow the ML edition to remain unchanged. The complete text of *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers*, he noted, would add 200 pages to the collection, at a resetting cost of around \\$2,000; changing the page numerals from p. 437 to the end would cost an additional \\$200 or \\$300 (Commins to Atkinson, 1 April 1949). The ML never acted on Atkinson’s suggestion.   \n\n*Walden and Other Writings* sold over 6,000 copies by early 1939 (Cerf to Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). It sold 11,558 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ninth best-selling title in the regular ML. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,694 copies, making it the regular ML’s thirty-second best-selling title.   \n\n#### 305b.

Thoreau spent his life listening to “a different drummer,” and in following his belief that the individual could lead a life of simplicity and independence apart from social organization and material civilization, he anticipated one of the major themes of contemporary America. His writings communicate his thoughts and offer us his personal vision of life as well as its tranformation [*sic*] into a practical working philosophy on which he based his life style. \n> This volume contains the full text of *Walden* as well as the essays *Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Life Without Principle*, and many of the famous nature studies. The editor, Brooks Atkinson, has contributed a penetrating critical and biographical introduction.   \n\nThe offset plates for the text, contents pages, and introduction were photographically reproduced from a printing of 305a or 305b. Atkinson’s introduction is repaginated to correspond with 305c but the place and date of composition (omitted from 305c) is restored.

Designed by Paul Galdone, July 1937; unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> The mastery with which Virginia Woolf has achieved such novels and books of essays as *Mrs. Dalloway* (No. 96), *To the Lighthouse*, *The Common Reader* and *A Room of One’s Own* has at last brought her the public tribute of having a national best-seller in *The Years*. *To the Lighthouse* is in Mrs. Woolf’s best vein, quiet [*sic*] evocative, full of the interplay of human emotion. In addition, its autobiographical *note* throws light upon her own family, one of the most illustrious in England. (*Fall 1937*)   \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1927. ML edition (pp. [5]–310) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published September 1937. *WR* 25 September 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1948.   \n\nTotal ML sales of *To the Lighthouse* were 38,000 copies (Kirkpatrick, *Virginia Woolf*, p. 31). *To the Lighthouse* sold 3,203 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Mrs. Dalloway* (168) sold 4,271 copies during the same period.   \n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *To the Lighthouse*, *Mrs. Dalloway*, and seven other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had only a few copies of *To the Lighthouse* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take two months for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June and 28 June 1948).   \n\n#### 306b.

Designed by Paul Galdone, July 1937; unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> When the completed trilogy, *U. S. A.*, of which *The 42nd Parallel* is the introductory novel, will have been published in the Modern Library, John Dos Passos will have gained the distinction of being represented by four titles in the series. *Three Soldiers* (No. 205), his war novel, has been in active demand for years. Following the publication of *The 42nd Parallel*, *1919* and *The Big Money* will be issued in successive seasons. By this plan, John Dos Passos’ original intention of maintaining the unity of the three novels will be fulfilled. (*Fall 1937*)   \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Brothers, 1930; rights subsequently acquired by Harcourt, Brace & Co. ML edition of *The 42nd Parallel* printed from plates made from a new Harcourt, Brace typesetting with revisions by the author. The plates were subsequently used for the one-volume edition of *U.S.A.* published by Harcourt, Brace in January 1938 and reprinted in ML Giants in 1939. Published 10 November 1937. *WR* 13 November 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940 after the ML published *U.S.A.* as a Giant (G42).   \n\nThe ML signed a contract with Harcourt, Brace to publish *The 42nd Parallel*, *Nineteen Nineteen*, and *The Big Money* in the regular ML in the fall seasons of 1937, 1938, and 1939 (Cerf to Dos Passos, 23 June 1937). The ML appears to have offered a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for each volume. Cerf indicated after signing the reprint contract, “I am really delighted that we are going to have these books in the Modern Library. John Dos Passos is exactly the kind of author that we can sell in this series” (Cerf to Donald Brace, 13 May 1937).   \n\nHarcourt, Brace reset *The 42nd Parallel*, incorporating corrections of a large number of typographical errors submitted by Dos Passos. The ML edition was the first printing from the new typesetting. Dos Passos had also made extensive revisions for the ML edition of *Three Soldiers* (248).   \n\nCerf asked Dos Passos to write a short foreword to the ML edition of *The 42nd Parallel*, noting that he believed his foreword to the ML edition of *Three Soldiers* (248) “materially helped the sale of the book.” He offered the usual \\$50 fee with the apology that the ML couldn’t afford more but enclosed a ML list and invited Dos Passos to select any books he wanted (Cerf to Dos Passos, ibid.). Dos Passos eventually selected about a hundred titles. He promised to send a short introduction and noted, “I’m not quite sure whether this is the time to spill the fact that the narratives will be collected into a one volume novel under the name of *U.S.A.* or not” (Dos Passos to Cerf, 4 July 1937).   \n\n>The introduction to the ML edition, dated July 1937, begins:  <br> *The 42nd Parallel* is the first volume of *U. S. A.*, a long narrative which deals with the more or less entangled lives of a number of Americans during the first three decades of the present century. The volumes that follow are called *1919* and *The Big Money*. \n> In an effort to take in as much as possible of the broad field of the lives of these times, three separate sequences have been threaded in and out among the stories. Of these *The Camera Eye* aims to indicate the position of the observer and *Newsreel* to give an inkling of the common mind of the epoch. Portraits of a number of real people are interlarded in the pauses in the narrative because their lives seem to embody so well the quality of the soil in which Americans of these generations grew. \n> This method was used with the idea of coping with the particular job in hand rather than from any generalized theory about novelwriting [*sic*]. In fact I don’t think any such theory holds water. The shape of a piece of work should be imposed, and in a good piece of work always is imposed, by the matter. That’s more or less of a commonplace of a considerable body of literary criticism.   \n\nThe ML later renegotiated the reprint contract so that the trilogy could appear as a Giant rather than separate volumes in the regular ML. *U.S.A.* (G42) was published as a Giant in February 1939, and *The 42nd Parallel* was discontinued as a separate volume in fall 1940.   \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>   \nDos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (1932–1963) 248   \nDos Passos, *U.S.A.* (1939–1962) G42   \n\n",

Originally, it contained analyses of the weird cases of Lizzie Borden, Benjamin Nathan, Captain Nash, Mabel Page and others. In the Modern Library edition two world-renowned cases are added, those of Bruno Hauptmann and the insurance murder of the almost indestructible Michael Malloy, with an essay, “Do We Execute Innocent People?” (*Spring 1938*)   \n\nOriginally published by the Macmillan Co., 1924. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with illustrations omitted and three chapters added: “Malloy the Mighty,” “Hauptmann and Circumstantial Evidence,” and “Do We Execute Innocent People?” Published February 1938. *WR* 12 February 1938. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.   \n\nThe plates of the Macmillan edition were too large for the ML’s format. The added chapters in the ML edition were originally published in *The New Yorker*: “Malloy the Mighty” (23 September 1933), “Hauptmann and Circumstantial Evidence” (9 March 1935), and “Do We Execute Innocent People?” (22 June 1935). The Appendix is reprinted from the Macmillan edition and includes sources and acknowledgments for the first five chapters only.   \n\n*Studies in Murder* sold 3,713 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.   \n\n#### 309b.

Walter D. Edmonds has re-created all its lost glories in a book that is remarkable as a contribution to American folklore and fascinating as a novel of adventure. The dramatized version of *Rome Haul*, under the title of *The Farmer Takes a Wife*, enjoyed great success on the stage and screen. In the Modern Library series it will enlist a new army of enthusiasts. (*Spring 1938*)   \n\nOriginally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1929.

Three-line statement on front panel: “*A New Masterpiece*” | *The strange and disturbing drama of* | *two men and a woman*.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> Genuine compassion for his vagabonds and human flotsam gives the breath of life to John Steinbeck’s novels and makes them idylls of the lower depths. *Of Mice and Men* is Steinbeck at his compassionate best; it is a story movingly and forcefully told and with overtones of soaring beauty. Its first success as a national best-seller and its subsequent triumph in dramatic form have helped to place John Steinbeck in the company of the first prose writers of America. (*Spring 1938*)   \n\nOriginally published by Covici, Friede, 1937, and subsequently by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [5]–186) printed from Covici, Friede/Viking plates. Published February 1938. *WR* 5 March 1938. First printing: Not ascertained.   \n\nCerf and Klopfer arranged the ML reprint with Covici, Friede, which had been Steinbeck’s publisher since the publication of his fourth novel, *Tortilla Flat*, in 1935. The close working relationship between Steinbeck and his editor Pascal Covici was comparable to those between F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway with Maxwell Perkins at Charles Scribner’s Sons. Covici, Friede failed shortly after *Of Mice and Men* appeared in the ML. The firm was acquired by Viking Press, Covici became a Viking editor, and Steinbeck became a Viking author. Arrangements for the second ML printing were made with Viking Press in October 1938.   \n\nThere were four ML printings between October 1938 and September 1942 totaling 10,000 copies. Steinbeck’s first book with Viking Press, *The Grapes of Wrath*, sold 430,000 copies in less than a year and was the best-selling work of fiction for 1939 (Madison, pp. 306–7; Hackett and Burke, p. 127).   \n\nWhen *Of Mice and Men* was published in the ML it had to compete with a 39-cent reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books. Lewis Miller, the Random House sales manager, told one of the sales representatives: “Bennett felt strongly that the book deserved a place in the Modern Library, no matter what other editions were to be had” (Miller to Rosengren, 24 January 1938).   \n\n*Of Mice and Men* sold 7,020 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales of all four Steinbeck titles in the ML totaled 35,975 copies during this period. *The Grapes of Wrath* was the only Steinbeck novel among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\n#### 311b.

Sustained by the hope of someday owning a farm of their own, these two itinerant laborers arrive to work on a ranch in central California. George, who is short-tempered, relies on Lennie’s great physical strength for protection and in turn tries to keep his feeble-minded friend out of trouble. But in the end, Lennie’s fundamental weakness leads to the inevitable tragedy that Steinbeck so poignantly explores in this spare, poetic novel.   \n\nPublished spring 1979 at \\$5.95.

Today, as much as ever, his doctrines influence the way of life of the most populous nation on earth. A completely new English text has been prepared for the Modern Library edition of *The Wisdom of Confucius* under the editorship of Dr. Lin Yutang, the foremost interpreter of ancient and modern China in America today. (*Spring 1938*)   \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1938. *WR* 9 April 1938. First printing: Not ascertained.   \n\nSeveral months before *The Wisdom of Confucius* was published Cerf wrote to a publishers’ representative in New Zealand, “I call your particular attention to the Confucius volume, edited by Lin Yutang. I think this will prove one of the most popular titles we have ever had, and we expect about three times the normal advance sale on it” (Cerf to Nash & Kissling, 17 November 1937). Cerf’s prediction was correct. *The Wisdom of Confucius* was one of the ML’s best-selling titles. In 1942 it was the third best-selling title in the series.   \n\nWhile working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough to think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on Confucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and besides the introduction, it will be principally the work of translating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript will be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January 1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s financial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He received \\$300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April 1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a flat fee or was an advance against royalties.   \n\nLin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did not read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the collection appears to have been challenged. In 1939 Random House paid \\$250 for all rights to Miles Menander Dawson’s *The Conduct of Life (The Ethics of Confucius)*, originally published by International Press in 1915.   \n\n*The Wisdom of Confucius* sold 12,000 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it seventeenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. Sales declined by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 4,036 copies, making it sixty-first out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.   \n\n#### 312.1b.

His Introduction clarifies for the Western reader the great ethical teachings of Confucius.   \n\nIn 1945 the word “Jewish” was removed from the following sentence: “[Confucius] could sing and be extremely polite, but he also could hate and sneer with the hatred and contempt of a ‘real man,’ which was shared by Jesus in his hatred of the Jewish scribes” (p. 27, line 16). Freiman asked that the word be eliminated from the plates of both the regular ML and Illustrated ML editions (Freiman to Parkway Printing, 21 May 1945).   \n\n*The Wisdom of Confucius* was shifted from ML 7 to ML 306 in fall 1959 when the six-volume Shakespeare was renumbered ML 2–7.   \n\n####  312.2.

It aimed at political order by laying the basis for it in a moral order, and it sought political harmony by trying to achieve the moral harmony in man himself. . . . Fundamentally, it was a humanist attitude, brushing aside all futile metaphysics and mysticism, interested chiefly in the essential human relationships, and not in the world of spirits or in immortality. The strongest doctrine of this particular type of humanism, which accounts for its great enduring influence, is the doctrine that ‘the measure of man is man,’ a doctrine which makes it possible for the common man to begin somewhere as a follower of Confucianism by merely following the highest instincts of his own human nature, and not by looking for perfection in a divine ideal.”   \n\nPublished spring 1977 at \\$4.95.

He considered *Lust for Life* the most presentable book the ML had published, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also regarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and appearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar reprint published by Grosset & Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8 February 1939).  \n\nThe ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It sold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML titles. Adjusted for 18 months, 1951–52 sales exceed those for 1942–43 by fewer than 100 copies; the ranking of *Lust for Life* in the third quarter of ML sales during 1942–43 reflects the increase in demand for books of all kinds during the Second World War.  \n\nPocket Books, Inc., published *Lust for Life* as a 25-cent paperback in 1945. The film version of Stone’s novel starring Kirk Douglas, released in 1956, probably led to an increase in sales of the ML edition, but sales figures for the mid-1950s are not available.  \n\n#### 317b.

Without the slightest sacrifice of accuracy or clarity, every campaign, every innovation, every change of leadership of the entire conflict on land and sea and in the air is covered completely. This volume is identical with the original edition and includes the unabridged text, with full maps. *The War in Outline* is even more than a history; it is also a prophecy of what may happen during the war now threatening the world. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1936. ML edition (pp. v–285) printed from RH plates with list of maps on p. [xvii] revised to reflect the omission of two folded maps and the use of a third map on the endpapers. Published February 1939. *WR* 18 February 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1946.  \n\n*The War in Outline* was an abridgment of Liddell Hart’s *History of the World War, 1914–1918* (Little, Brown, 1935), which was originally published in 1930 as *The Real War* (Little, Brown, 1930). The abridgment reduced the text from 635 to 285 pages.  \n\nWhen the RH edition of *The War in Outline* was published Cerf wrote to Eugene O’Neill, who had lent him an earlier book by Liddell Hart: “I was so deeply impressed by that book that I swore that one day we’d get something by Hart [*sic*] for Random House. This is one time anyhow that a dream came true!” (Cerf to O’Neill, 21 September 1936). Cerf does not appear to have realized that Liddell Hart was a compound surname. The author’s forenames, Basil Henry, were omitted from the title pages of Random House and ML printings and also from the jacket, and *The War in Outline* was entered under “Hart” in ML lists and catalogues.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 2,481 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it among the thirty worst-selling titles for that period. Random House offered to sell the plates to Liddell Hart after the ML edition was discontinued (Emanuel Harper to Liddell Hart, 31 October 1947).  \n\n#### 318b.

(*Spring 1939*)  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1939. *WR* 8 April 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1958.  \n\nGeoffrey Keynes’s “Life of Izaak Walton” is reprinted from the Nonesuch Press edition of Walton’s complete works (*The Compleat Angler, The Lives of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, Herbert & Sanderson, with Love and Truth & Miscellaneous Writings*), published in 1929 in 1100 copies, 500 of which were distributed in the U.S. by Random House. The ML edition includes none of the illustrations from the Nonesuch Press edition, but both 319a and 319b retain Keynes’s reference to “the portrait by Jacob Huysman, from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved” (p. 12); a footnote indicates that the portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The revised “Life of Izaak Walton” in 319c omits the words, “from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved.” Keynes also refers to a pastel portrait of Walton by Edmund Ashfield. A footnote in 319a and 319b states, “Now in the possession of Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York”; the footnote in 319c reads, “Formerly in the possession of the late Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York” (p. 12).  \n\nThe ML edition sold 2,617 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing *The Compleat Angler* in the fourth quarter of ML titles during that 18-month period.

Izaak Walton’s classic is a book to be treasured by readers of every age and inclination—fishermen and nonfishermen. It is the compleat balm for troubled minds and a refuge of quiet in a noisy world. (*Fall 1954*)  \n\nKeynes’s “The Life of Izaak Walton” (pp. 3–13) was revised and reset in 1948. The printing with the spring 1949 jacket is probably the first from the reset plates. The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s mother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed Keynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton, survived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of Stafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A footnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter from Arthur M. Coon of Cornell University in *The Times Literary Supplement* (25 December 1937).  \n\nThe fall 1952 printing of the jacket was the last in three colors. The fall 1954 jacket in two colors (black and strong green) may have been a response to rising costs of color printing or declining sales of *The* *Compleat Angler*. The ML edition of *The Compleat Angler* was discontinued at the end of 1957.  \n\n",

In order to add an increasing number of admirers to those who have been acclaiming this book in its more expensive format, the editors of the Modern Library include it in the series. The felicity of writing, the charm and dramatic power of these tales, their dignity and beauty, create a spell for readers of every shade of interest. Dorothy Canfield contributes an illuminating introduction. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934, two years before the firm was acquired by Random House. ML edition (pp. v–420) printed from Smith and Haas/RH plates with decorative borders omitted from part title pages and part titles printed in black gothic type instead of red. Published April 1939. *WR* 8 April 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Published in Vintage Books, September 1972; restored to ML, 1980.  \n\nThe 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format was used because the original plates were too large for the ML’s standard balloon cloth format. Even with the larger format the margins of the printed pages are uncomfortably narrow. The switch from letterpress to offset lithographic printing in the 1960s allowed the type page of 320c to be reduced photographically from 160 x 98 mm to 146 x 90 mm. This allowed larger margins, but the substantial reduction in type size made the text harder to read. A happy medium is achieved in 320d. The format is increased to 7½ x 4⅞ in., and the type page has been increased photographically to 155 x 88 mm. However, the volume is an early example of perfect binding rather than sewn, and it is not unusual to find copies today that are falling apart.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 7,154 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing *Seven Gothic Tales* near the top of the second quarter of ML titles during this 18-month period. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. In contrast, sales of Dinesen’s *Out of Africa* (447), published in the ML in April 1952, placed it near the top of the second quarter of ML sales for the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 320b.

Since then, *Tales* has established itself as a classic. By using modern perceptions within the framework of the old Gothic tale, Baroness Blixen created, as one of her early critics wrote, “a book of unique atmosphere . . . a book bringing the psychological insight of a Henry James to the material of a Northern Boccaccio . . . a book of extraordinary fantasy that yet takes us intimately into a vivid variety of human lives.”  \n\nPublished spring 1980 at \\$5.95.

Since then Clifford Odets has extended and solidified his reputation as the most brilliant playwright of the younger generation. Each of his plays reveals an impressive development of his dramatic gifts.

Both were Random House authors.  \n\nThe trade edition of *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* was published primarily for sale to libraries. The same plates except for the half title and title page were used for printings of the ML and trade editions. The plates were designed for the ML’s larger format that was introduced in fall 1939; they would have been too large for the ML’s balloon cloth format that remained in use through spring 1939.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 4,819 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles.

The most notable dramatist to emerge from that adventure in the theatre was Clifford Odets. In the Spring of 1935 his first play, *Waiting for Lefty*, was produced and it created a sensation, both as a *tour de force* and as a drama of substantial theme and sharply drawn character. Since that first production, Clifford Odets has extended his reputation with other plays of distinction. This volume includes the complete texts of the following plays: *Waiting for Lefty*, *Awake and Sing*, *Till the Day I Die*, *Paradise Lost*, *Golden Boy*, and *Rocket to the Moon*.

(181 x 123 mm) with cream endpapers and Blumenthal binding. Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* and Six *Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) and were the first titles to be published in the ML’s larger 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format after it was adopted for all ML titles and the first to appear in the newly designed Blumenthal binding.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in brilliant greenish yellow (98) and black on coated white paper with multicolor illustration of itinerant fruit pickers—men, women, and children—walking along a road followed by a truck carrying more workers; lettering in reverse on black panels above and below the illustration; backstrip in brilliant greenish yellow with lettering in black. Illustration signed at lower right: [Valenti] Angelo.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Everyone who has been stirred by John Steinbeck’s *The Grapes of Wrath* must turn to *In Dubious Battle* to discover the source from which his most famous book drew its strength and deep humanity. In all his novels Steinbeck is preeminently the story-teller. In *In Dubious Battle* he is at the crest of his powers as he dramatizes the plight of men and women fighting for their lives. A common cause animates their struggle, and their heroism makes the narrative soar from climax to climax. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published by Covici, Friede, 1936; new bibliographical edition published by Viking Press, August 1939. ML edition (pp. [*7*]–343) printed from Viking plates. Published September 1939. *WR* 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nThe ML secured exclusive reprint rights to *In Dubious Battle* shortly before the publication of *The Grapes of Wrath* in 1939 vastly enlarged Steinbeck’s audience. An earlier reprint had been published by Blue Ribbon Books in October 1937, but it sold poorly and was out of print by November 1938. Lewis Miller expected the success of *The Grapes of Wrath* to stimulate interest in all of Steinbeck’s books (Miller to Crowder, 11 July 1939). In a memo to the sales force he urged the travelers to open their sales talks with *In Dubious Battle*:  \n\n> We got the sole reprint rights before GRAPES OF WRATH leaped to best-sellerdom and very lucky, too, for I am convinced it would have been more advantageous to the Viking crowd to have given the book to Grosset as well as to us. We would in that case have shared the market and perhaps not a big share either. If Grosset had IN DUBIOUS BATTLE they would get an advance of 20,000 to 25,000 copies, in my judgment. We are looking for an 8,000 to 10,000 advance on the strength of the fact that this brand new army of Steinbeck readers is now wide open for his past work. Every bookstore you call on has sold good quantities of GRAPES OF WRATH and that’s the market for IN DUBIOUS BATTLE. . . . Remember that IN DUBIOUS BATTLE does not take up much room and you have got to get at least a 25-stack if you expect the public to see it. We want 25’s, 50’s and 100’s. If a dealer buries this title on a shelf in 1’s and 2’s, we are licked before we start. (RH Box 153, Sales folder)  \n\nThe ML distributed a four-color display poster to bookstores that described *In Dubious Battle* as “a long, full, satisfying novel that deals with the same kind of characters and the same background as THE GRAPES OF WRATH” and launched a \\$7,500 advertising campaign that featured *In Dubious Battle* along with Steinbeck’s other ML titles, *Tortilla Flat* and *Of Mice and Men* (*PW*, 5 August 1939, p. 351). A special discount was offered for combination orders of all three Steinbeck titles: 41 percent for 50 copies, 40 + 5 percent for 100 copies, and 44 percent for of 250 copies. The 40 + 5 percent discount was normally reserved for the ML’s biggest customers, such as Brentano’s, Macy’s, and Marshall Field & Co., who obtained ML books (list price 95 cents) for 55 cents instead of the 57 cents paid by booksellers who got a straight 40 percent discount. Booksellers who received this discount were expected to promote the series aggressively.  \n\n“You can see the leverage you get with such a schedule,” Miller told the travelers. “You may get a dealer who can buy only 25 IN DUBIOUS BATTLE and you now have got a wedge to get 25 assorted out of the other two. And so on, up the scale” (RH Box 153, Sales folder). He also reminded them, “In selling this title don’t overlook the point that, because the book will be bound in stiff covers, it lends itself admirably to lending library use in addition to over-the-counter sales” (Miller to Consolino, 31 July 1939).  \n\n*The Grapes of Wrath* led the 1939 best-seller list and remained one of the ten best-selling fiction titles in 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29). Sales figures for the ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* are not available for 1939 and 1940. The ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* sold 6,028 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles—but by then *The Grapes of Wrath* itself was available in the ML. *In Dubious Battle* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 322b.

Full-bodied, broadly humorous, this swift-paced classic is a biting commentary on the pretenses and foibles of eighteenth-century England, and is as fresh and vivid today as it was when written. It is doubtful if its array of characters has ever been surpassed in English fiction for brilliance, economy and variety.

Moriarty suggested Howard Mumford Jones, a professor of English at Harvard. When Cerf contacted Jones he explained that the ML could “only pay \\$50 for forewords because of the small margin of profit on which the library is operated. On the other hand, there are no stipulations whatever as to the length of the foreword or contents thereof” (Cerf to Jones, 8 June 1939). Jones suggested George Sherwood of Columbia University as better qualified, but after a second letter from Cerf he agreed to write the introduction himself.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 2,823 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles.

(*Not seen*)  \n\n> Flap text rewritten:  <br> Fielding himself described *Joseph* *Andrews* as a satire “in imitation of the manner of Cervantes.” Its original purpose was to heap ridicule on the then popular romantic heroine of Samuel Richardson’s *Pamela*. But the novel grew beyond its first intention and became more than a mere parody. In its own right it earned the status of one of the major works of fiction of the mid-eighteenth century and was the forerunner of Fielding’s masterpiece, *Tom Jones* (Modern Library No. 185). Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on the pretenses and follies of English society, *Joseph Andrews* is a novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired. (*Spring 1954*)  \n\nPublished initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.  \n\nWhen *Joseph Andrews* was included on the first list of titles to be published in MLCE, Stein offered Jones \\$75 to add a bibliography and invited him to look over the introduction to see if he would like to make any changes (Stein to Jones, 27 January 1950).

Such a novel is *Hear, Ye Sons* and it is revived at a moment when persecution of a defenseless minority is spreading all over the world.

It is a novel alive with the spirit of tolerance. (*Fall 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published by Longmans, Green & Co., 1933. ML edition (pp. [*7*], vii–306) printed from Longmans, Green plates.

Fineman indicated in 1938 that reprint houses had been asking for the book for several years but that he had held off, hoping that it would appear in the ML. He added that if the ML did not want it he would let it go to another reprinter (Fineman to Cerf, 26 December 1938). Cerf replied two days later that he wanted to publish *Hear, Ye Sons* in fall 1939 and invited Fineman to write a new preface (Cerf to Fineman, 28 December 1939). “A Belated Preface” (pp. [i–v]) was written for the ML edition.  \n\nThe ML edition of *Hear, Ye Sons* sold poorly and was discontinued after two years and two-and-a-half months, making it the shortest-lived ML title.

Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s pretensions and his discomfiture, you will relish this rich portrait of a New England family with its background of rigid Puritanism. The tone throughout this novel is gentle, compassionate and ironic; its total purpose and achievement is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a passing but still warmly human American way of life.

In it he recounts the age-old plight of the man of integrity who must struggle alone against the evil forces of prejudice and reaction. With an unerring insight into the Jewish spirit, Mr. Lewisohn reveals the nobility of a people reflected by one of its sons in the modern world.

Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place.

When it first appeared, in 1924, critics everywhere acclaimed it as a brilliant novel which upheld the highest traditions of English fiction. In the intervening fifteen years, it has established itself with the general public as a twentieth-century classic. Its subtle characterizations, its deep understanding of the Eastern mind, and its serene spirit make it a story to be cherished by a world from which all tranquillity seems to have departed.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1949.  \n\nCerf tried to include *A Passage to India* in the ML shortly after he and Klopfer acquired the series (Cerf to Alfred Harcourt, 10 March 1926). Harcourt, Brace was agreeable but decided to ask Forster’s permission. Nine months later Harcourt reported, “The upshot of our correspondence with him is that we are forced to the decision not to sell this book to The Modern Library for next year” (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 11 December 1926). *A Passage to India* did not appear in the ML until thirteen years later.  \n\nShortly after the Second World War, Harcourt, Brace launched its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for *A Passage to India* and eight other titles, including works by Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 3,300 copies of *A Passage to India* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948). *A Passage to India* sold 6,654 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.

They have emphasized the religious and literary qualities of the Book of books, and have made it easy to read and understand. The historical background of each book is traced in simple and succinct commentaries, and the very arrangement of the books themselves, in the probable order of their writing, throws new light on the development of religious thought. *The Short Bible* is a boon to those who seek its essential truth and beauty. (*Fall 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by University of Chicago Press, 1933. ML edition (pp. v–[549]) printed from University of Chicago Press plates. Published September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1969/70.  \n\n*The Short Bible* was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed to secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s *The Complete Bible: An American Translation* (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they wanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a \\$5,000 advance for *The Complete Bible* ($3,000 on signing and \\$2,000 one year after publication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think we could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to Donald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the University of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of *The Complete Bible* was premature, Cerf offered a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *The Short Bible* (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939). Shortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean to run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became Acting Manager of the Press.  \n\nCerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting *The Complete Bible*. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with Goodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the complete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to the Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from California he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and Goodspeed had decided against a ML edition of *The Short Bible*. He reported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . . you and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up the Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until we can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant edition of the *Complete Bible*. I told him that we both understand full well that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but if we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to guarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of our contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December 1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).  \n\nLewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead with *The Short Bible*. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell well, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML rejected it, and that whichever firm got *The Short Bible* would have a “toe-hold” on *The Complete Bible*. He recommended that the ML secure *The Short Bible* on the understanding that it would get *The Complete Bible* if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and Klopfer’s concern that a ML edition of *The Short Bible* might injure their chances of getting *The Complete Bible* if it sold poorly but concluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23 February 1940).  \n\nCerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three days later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for *The Short Bible* was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After signing Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a reprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given the first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this edition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).  \n\nTwo years later Cerf offered a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights to *The Complete Bible*. Hemens replied that it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be different the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to Cerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that many readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have the complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really impressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). *The Complete Bible* never appeared in the ML.  \n\nThe text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted and abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago Press jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and appealing than that of the original edition.  \n\nThe ML edition of *The Short Bible* sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional printings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and printings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January 1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML titles.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \n*The Holy Bible*, illus.

In C. S. Forester’s happiest vein, this fabulous tale maintains from first page to last its breathless excitement. An asthmatic steam launch carries a timid Cockney and a maidenly English missionary on a river in Central Africa to the adventure of their lives. Romance triumphs over fate, tropical heat and whizzing bullets. *The African Queen* is a story to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime. (*Fall 1940*) \n\n> Front flap reset with last sentence revised:  “*The African Queen* is a story of high adventure and suspense, to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime.” (*Fall 1959*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Little, Brown & Co., 1935, with the last four chapters of the British edition omitted. ML edition (pp. [1]–275) printed from Little, Brown plates with the last four chapters restored. Chapters 16–19 (pp. 276–[308]) printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies.  \n\nCerf had never read *The African Queen*. He asked Little, Brown for a copy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about an hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that it was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years before the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.  \n\nForester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters omitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the foreword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in writing another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the end of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end without calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was called for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and it was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I really appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked of its last two [*sic*] chapters. . . . So it is with very great pleasure that I welcome this reissue of *The African Queen* for the opportunity it gives me of presenting the book in the form in which I first pictured it” (p. [*8*]).  \n\n",

(*Fall 1962*)  \n\n*Jacket A (ML 88):* Pictorial in strong pink (2) and dark blue (183) on light gray (264) paper depicting an outdoor fountain with cacti, gourd pots and a tree with foliage in strong pink; lettering in dark blue.  \n\n>  Front flap:<br> The few, exquisitely wrought tales written by Katherine Anne Porter have firmly established her reputation as one of the masters of the short-story form. Critics have vied with one another in lavishing their praise for the crystalline quality of her prose, and her public has grown in ever-widening circles, until now the devotees of her writings include the most discriminating readers in America. *Flowering Judas and Other Stories* takes an honored place on the Modern Library shelf as a collection of short tales worthy of the illustrious company of great writers already represented in the series. (*Fall 1940*)  \n\n*Jacket B (ML 284):* Pictorial in pale green (149), deep red (13) and black on cream paper with illustration from jacket A reduced in size and printed in deep red and black at lower right with portion of design uncolored; lettering in black on background printed in pale green at top and deep red at foot. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A through second sentence; third sentence replaced by the following: <br> *Flowering Judas and Other Stories* and *Pale Horse, Pale Rider* (Number 45) are the two collections of tales by Katherine Anne Porter in the Modern Library. Both rank high in the honored company of world-famous writers of short stories represented in the series. (*Spring 1953*)  \n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1935. ML edition (pp. [*9*]–285) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published September 1940 as ML 88. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1950; restored spring 1953 as ML 284. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a \\$250 advance, and Porter received \\$25 for her introduction. In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was pleased that *Flowering Judas* was to be included in the series. She wrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I hope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a buyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library a God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have more.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly, a kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book; authors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little on the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8 May 1940).  \n\nThe ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier that year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book sells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of letting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).  \n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was terminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400 copies of *Flowering Judas* in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it would take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued in fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s *Light in August* (429), which was published in the series shortly after *Flowering Judas* was discontinued.  \n\nHarcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including *Flowering Judas* in Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring 1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and assigned *Flowering Judas* a new number (ML 284). Some copies of the 1946 ML printing that remained in the warehouse were sold in the spring 1953 jacket.  \n\n#### 333b.

No one could have thought so who had read HUMAN BEING. –*Christopher Morley*”); backstrip with same textured background as front panel with torchbearer and title in reverse; author, ML number, publisher, and frame around title in black. Designed by Paul Galdone, June 1940; unsigned.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> Writing of *Human Being*, Edna Ferber said: “It is a glorious book, a wise and deeply understanding book. It has a touch of God in it, and the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, *Kitty Foyle*, as well as those who have yet to experience their first acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of *Human Being*. (*Fall 1940*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights subsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp. [*5*–*7*], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a correction requested by Morley. Published October 1940. *WR* 12 October 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.  \n\nThe suggestion to include *Human Being* in the ML came from Morley himself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):  \n\n> Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little to see myself represented in there only by *Parnassus on Wheels*; a worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look at it now. \n> I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in *Human Being*, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person; a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.  \n\nCerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be represented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I don’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be added; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley backlist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern Library” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted that he had never read *Human Being* and asked Morley to send him a copy (Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he still thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general interest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think that a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was able to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf to Morley, 30 August 1939).  \n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing *Human Being* in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would prefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf agreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob [Haas] and I still think it is a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and the huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to Morley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition corrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.  \n\n*Human Being* sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that category. *Parnassus on Wheels* (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was the second worst-selling title.  \n\nThere was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By February 1944 sales of the ML edition of *Human Being* exceeded 6,000 copies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nMorley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (1931–1954) 213 ",

Adapted from Ernst Reichl’s jacket for the original RH edition. The original jacket is signed “REICHL” in sans-serif capitals along the lower right margin. The reduction in size of the ML jacket is achieved by cropping the side and lower margins, resulting in the omission of his name. \n\n> Front flap:<br> When this volume first appeared in 1934 under the Random House imprint, William Saroyan’s meteoric flight across the literary skies was begun. For a book of short stories, it had an unprecedented success and was an augury of his continuing national fame. Since then William Saroyan has maintained his position among the foremost writers of America. Winner of the Drama Critics Circle award and also winner, but scorner, of the Pulitzer Prize for *The Time of Your Life*, he has achieved quite as sensational a name for himself in the field of the drama as in the short story. (*Spring 1941*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1934. ML edition (pp. [vii–x], 9–270) printed from RH plates with running heads removed to accommodate the ML’s smaller format and with page numerals 7–8 removed from the table of contents, which was revised to include Saroyan’s preface to the ML edition. Published January 1941. *WR* 25 January 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948. \n\n*The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* was one of the first trade titles published by Random House. Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to design trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the plates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such as the removal of running heads. \n\nThe ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML titles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the ML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was out of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print and that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to Saroyan, 5 April 1949). \n\n",

Signed: Galdone. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The perennial success of *Les Miserables* in the Modern Library has induced the editors to add Victor Hugo’s companion masterpiece, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, to the series. Adult readers of every taste and opinion turn back to these monumental novels of the Romantic School for escape [+and excitement] and solace, and new generations receive their first introduction to the world of good books by the discovery of such [+pulse-quickening] novels as *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*. Young and old are rewarded by a story that stirs the heart and kindles the imagination. (*Spring 1941; [Fall 1953]*) \n\nAnonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. and other publishers. ML edition (pp. [5]–416) printed from Burt plates with the table of contents reset. Published January 1941. *WR* 25 January 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nThe anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on the first printing of Hugo’s *Notre-Dame de Paris* (1831) and does not include three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in December 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and Book Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation used by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and Book Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and 5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not “augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The three added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been misplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be included in the 1832 printing (Hugo, *Notre-Dame de Paris*, translated and edited by John Sturrock [London: Penguin Books, 2004], pp. 26–29). \n\nThe absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill That), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the printing press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the public expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during the world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan pagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of the human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious symbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own monument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191). \n\nWhen the ML reprinted *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* in 1996 as part of the “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous and incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and 1971. \n\n*The Hunchback of Notre Dame* sold 4,004 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. Hugo’s *Les Misérables* (G3) was in first quarter of ML titles at both periods. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nHugo, *Les Misérables* (Giant, 1931–1973, 1980– ) G3 \n\n",

Published January 1941. *WR* 25 January 1941. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nThe ML presented the National Home Library Foundation with a complete set of ML books in print in exchange for the free use of its plates. The first printing of the ML edition failed to acknowledge the Foundation. It included instead the following statement, adapted from the National Home Library Foundation edition: “Acknowledgment is made, with thanks, for the aid received from the *Carnegie Corporation of New York* in making possible this edition of *The Federalist*” (p. [iv]). The ML removed the title leaf of remaining copies of the first printing and tipped in a new title leaf which acknowledged the National Home Library Foundation on the verso (338a<sub>2</sub>). \n\nThe ML edition sold 7,782 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML titles.

Mittell of the National Home Library Foundation informed Klopfer shortly after publication that the ML should have thanked the Foundation and that the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation would have to be removed. Klopfer agreed to rip the title leaf out of every copy in stock and tip in a corrected leaf with the acknowledgment, “The publishers are indebted to the National Home Library Foundation for making this edition possible and wish to thank them for the courtesy extended in the use of their plates” (Klopfer to Mittell, 27 February 1941; Mittell to Klopfer, 4 March 1941). A sizable portion of the first printing appears to have been distributed before the cancellation and replacement of the title leaf. Copies of 338a<sub>2</sub> are notably harder to find than copies of 338a<sub>1</sub>. \n\nAfter Mittell’s death in 1942 his widow offered to sell the National Home Library Foundation plates to the ML.

Cerf wanted to include William Butler Yeats’s one-act play, *Cathleen ni Houlihan*. He initially offered a flat fee of \\$50 to include the play, then increased the offer to a \\$100 advance against royalties of 1 percent of the list price. Mrs. Yeats did not reply to his letters. The Synge estate granted permission to include *The Playboy of the Western World* and *Riders to the Sea* for a \\$200 advance against a 2 percent royalty. The Synge estate received the entire amount even though Random House, as Synge’s U.S. publisher, might have claimed half of it; the advance exceeded the total 1939 royalties for the RH edition of Synge’s *Complete Works* (Cerf to Denis Synge Stephens, 15 October 1940). Lady Gregory’s *Spreading the News* was obtained for a flat fee of \\$25. \n\nThe ML edition sold 3,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the fourth quarter of ML titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. \n\n",

As a fictional account of a migration unique in American history, it will endure as a magnificent work of literature. *The Grapes of Wrath* is the novel by which John Steinbeck achieved his greatest fame. It is one of four of his books on the Modern Library shelf. The other three are *Tortilla Flat* (No. 216), *Of Mice and Men* (No. 29) and *In Dubious Battle* (No. 115). (*Spring 1954*) \n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1939. ML edition (pp. [*7*]–619) printed from Viking plates. Published October 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1959. \n\nThe Viking Press edition led the best-seller list in 1939 with sales of 300,000 copies (Hackett and Burke, p. 127). The ML paid Viking Press a \\$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for non-exclusive reprint rights. There was a ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1942; later printings included 4,000 copies each in May 1943 and June 1944. \n\nThe ML edition sold 9,495 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing *The Grapes of Wrath* in the middle of the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales declined to 3,964 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it toward the bottom of the first quarter of titles. \n\nIn Chapter 30 (the last chapter) of Viking Press printings, the number of lines per page increases between the fifth printing (May 1939) and ninth printing (September 1939). The first page of Chapter 30 (p. 593) of the ninth printing has one more line than early printings; lines are shifted forward throughout the chapter, with the result that the last page of text (p. 619) has only four lines—five fewer than the fifth printing. The reason for the shift has not been determined. The plates used by the ML reflect the later configuration of Chapter 30. \n\nThe ML’s reprint contract appears to have been terminated in 1958 when Viking Press published *The Grapes of Wrath* in its quality paperback series, Compass Books. The Modern Library edition was discontinued at the end of 1959.

The most important of the Socratic dialogues, the *Republic* is concerned with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But above all, the *Republic* is an attempt to define “justice”; by imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers. \n> The text used here is the classic Jowett translation, complete and unabridged, with notes and marginalia for the student, scholar, and general reader alike. \n\nPublished fall 1982 at \\$7.95.

The first printing is on thicker paper than most of the later printings, and there is no list of titles inside the jacket. \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), moderate yellow (87) and black on cream paper with drawing of a fort and cannon in black and moderate greenish blue against moderate yellow background; lettering in black except last two words of title in moderate greenish blue outlined in black. Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition with a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot of the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML jacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the Bemelmans drawing on the title page. \n\n> Front flap:<br> What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ *My War with the United States* fulfils that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a reprint edition. \n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. [3], [5]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published October 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948. \n\nThe verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement, “Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway Printing Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The ML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset department before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that specialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its standard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible that Parkway subcontracted the job. \n\nThere are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a ML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were printed from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset printing. \n\nThe jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and the inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings of the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring 1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so they could be included in later offset printings of the jacket. \n\nThe ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl Harbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings are on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to enhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset lithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of wartime paper shortages. \n\nThe ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and Giant titles. \n\n",

This injustice to his reputation has been completely revised since his death by a new estimate of his place among the world’s great story–tellers. Now he is as much admired for his vigor and warmth and unfailing sense of the dramatic as for his irrepressible humor. *The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner*—thirty-five in all—represent, in John Chamberlain’s opinion, “The full measure of the talent of the man who is pre-eminently our best short story writer.” (*Fall 1941*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except in black, vivid orange (48), light yellow (86) and gold with inset panel in black instead of vivid orange.

Cerf had tried to get Lardner’s stories for the ML on several occasions before Scribner’s agreed to a reprint edition. He noted in spring 1941 when he requested permission to include the book in the fall, “It is a glaring omission on our list and it has been commented on so many times that I am getting tired of hearing it” (Cerf to Max Perkins, 1 May 1941).

Whether his predictions were accidental or based upon an occult foreknowledge, they are frequently uncanny in their accuracy. His book of oracles is having a tremendous vogue at present, partly because of the wide variety of interpretations that can be made from his prognostications, but mainly because it makes fascinating reading when related to the catastrophes announced daily while the world is in crisis. This edition [±volume], edited by Charles A. Ward, gives special emphasis to prophecies of contemporary events and those immediately ahead. (*Fall 1941; [Fall 1954]*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Scribner & Welford, 1891; published with Supplement by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1940. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the frontispiece from the 1672 London edition omitted from the Supplement. The 1940 Scribner printing places the Supplement after the index and paginates it separately from the rest of the text; the ML edition places the Supplement before the index. Published February 1942. *WR* 14 February 1942. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML edition of *Oracles of Nostradamus* was published two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The decision to include Nostradamus had been made before the United States entered the war. Cerf commented, “We put that title in, possibly with our tongues in our cheeks, because people seem to be interested in predictions of a strange character” (“Of Men and Books: Critic John C. Frederick, guest Bennett Cerf, in a Radio Conversation over the Columbia Broadcasting System,” *Northwestern University on the Air* 2, no. 16 [16 January1943], p. 4).\n\nWhen the United States declared war on Japan on 8 December 1941 and recognized a state of war with Germany and Italy three days later, the future looked dark and the outcome of the war was uncertain. *The Oracles of Nostradamus* became one of the Modern Library’s best-selling titles. It sold 16,043 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. Only five ML titles—Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage* (199) and Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228) in the regular series, and *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* (G37), James T. Farrell’s *Studs Lonigan* (G39), and *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* (G59) in the Giants—sold more copies during this period.\n\n*The Oracles of Nostradamus* did not rank among the 100 best-selling regular ML titles in 1951/52.\n\n#### 346b.

Fujita “ml” symbol in brilliant blue below front panel text; title and Fujita torchbearer on spine in vivid orange yellow.\n\n> Front flap:<br> The oracles of the sixteenth-century astrologer Nostradamus have exerted a great influence over the minds of men in every century since his death, and in times of war, famine, and political upheaval are read with increasing curiosity. The delphic character of the oracles makes it difficult to identify correctly each country and person described—but the disturbing accuracy of the few clearly dated prophecies has given Nostradamus added authority. \n> The interpretive work of Charles Ward, which makes up the body of this volume, was completed in 1891. To it has been added a supplementary section of oracles, literally translated from the French, and un-interpreted, whose application to the twentieth century again arouses amazement at the uncanny foresight of Europe’s most famous seer.\n\n",

Its unforgettable story of the individual soldier in the stress of actual battle has never been surpassed, and its truth and reality are just as gripping under the conditions of aerial and tank warfare today as they were under the circumstances of musket and cavalry charges of the Civil War. *The Red Badge of Courage* is a notable addition to the Modern Library series because of all war books it remains through the years one of the most permanent. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by D. Appleton & Co., 1895. New bibliographical edition published by Appleton, 1925, with essay on Crane by Max J. Herzberg. ML edition (pp. v–[267]) printed from Appleton-Century plates. Published February 1942. *WR* 14 February 1942. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nCerf tried to secure reprint rights to *The Red Badge of Courage* as early as 1928, when he offered a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928), but Appleton refused to grant permission. The copyright status of the novel was unclear. Alfred A. Knopf had included it in a 12-volume limited edition of Crane’s works published in 1925. In the early 1930s, when Knopf was considering including it in an omnibus edition of Crane’s works, his lawyers concluded that it was in the public domain. Cerf told Knopf that he planned to offer Appleton a \\$600 advance against royalties of 6 cents a copy and would probably publish it in the ML without permission if Appleton rejected the offer (Cerf to Knopf, 2 December 1932). Neither Knopf nor Cerf went ahead with their plans. When the ML published *The Red Badge of Courage* ten years later it was by arrangement with Appleton-Century and printed from Appleton plates. The ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy.\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,660 copies during the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML titles. The release of John Huston’s film version in 1951 appears to have boosted sales. The ML edition sold 7,418 copies between November 1951 and October 1952, making *The Red Badge of Courage* the19th best-selling title in the series.\n\n#### 347.1b.

Stein, who edited Modern Library College Editions, wanted to add several stories by Crane to the volume, in part because he thought it might forestall Rinehart & Co. from bringing out a competing edition in their paperback series for the college market (Stein to Stallman, 11 July 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 28 August 1950). Stallman suggested “Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,” “The Open Boat,” “An Episode of War,” “The Upturned Face,” and “A Mystery of Heroism.” Stein hoped to secure permission to include the stories for a flat fee, but Knopf insisted on a royalty. Appleton-Century-Crofts was charging a 2-cent royalty for the use of their plates for MLCE printings. Adding the stories would have increased the royalty for MLCE printings to 4 cents a copy and also added to the cost of the regular ML edition. Haas indicated that this was too much, and plans to include the stories were abandoned (Haas to Stein, 30 August 1950).\n\n#### 347.1c.

He was the first American writer to depict the horrors of war, the ambiguities of courage, and the absence of heroic illusions among soldiers. In addition, *The Red Badge of Courage* is a brilliantly structured work that illuminates the nature of the artistic imagination: Stephen Crane did not experience the war first hand, but through the powers of empathy and projection he has given us an unparalleled and unforgettable picture of the Civil War stripped of romantic glorification.\n\n#### 347.2.

(*Spring 1942*)\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in a red, white and blue motif on coated cream paper, with upper panel in moderate blue (182) with light bluish gray (190) areas suggesting clouds and one deep red (13) star and lettering in black (author in full capitals, title in hand-drawn open-face letters); lower panel with line drawing of a small town street with shops, parked cars and a church against alternating horizontal stripes in cream and vivid red (11) fading to light yellowish pink (28) at right. Signed: Galdone.\n\n> Front flap:<br> The first American to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, Sinclair Lewis is now represented in the Modern Library series by two of his most memorable novels—*Arrowsmith* (No. 42) and *Babbitt*. His portrait of George F. Babbitt, realtor, is so firm in the minds of all English–speaking people that the name has become incorporated into the language as a permanent word. Readers of every language into which *Babbitt* has been translated regard it as Sinclair Lewis’s masterpiece and have created from it a conception of an American type of the prosaic but always human business man. (*Fall 1941*)\n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1922. ML edition (pp. [*7*]–401) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February 1942. *WR* 14 February 1942. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1949.\n\nThe first Harcourt, Brace printing, published in September 1922, exists in two states, with the second state containing two corrections on p. 49 (“Lyte” instead of “Purdy” in line 3, “any” instead of “my” in line 5). Three more corrections were made in the second printing, one correction (“for” instead of “against” on p. 392, line 1) was made in the third printing, and eleven more corrections were made in the fourth printing, making the fourth printing “the most authoritative version of the work” (John Hersey, “Note on the Texts,” *Main Street & Babbitt* [New York: Library of America, 1992], p. 883).\n\nHarcourt, Brace anticipated strong sales and made a duplicate set of plates, probably before *Babbitt* was published. The duplicate plates incorporate the corrections in the second state of the first printing but not those in the second, third, or fourth printings, which were made between October and November 1922. The duplicate plates or shells, which appear to have been made in July 1922, were held in reserve.\n\nWhen the ML negotiated reprint rights in 1941, Harcourt, Brace melted the original plates, which had become worn, and provided the duplicate plates to the ML for its printings. ML printings, as well as later printings in Harbrace Modern Classics (1950) and other reprint editions, revert to the text of the second state of the first printing, and do not include the corrections made in the second, third, and fourth printings (Matthew J. Bruccoli, “Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis’s *Babbitt*,” *Studies in Bibliography* 11 (1958): 263–68; available online at [http://www.bsuva.org](http://www.bsuva.org/). For the next fifty years all American printings—including the paperback edition in Signet Classics (1961)—appear to have omitted the corrections made to the text in the third, fourth, and fifth Harcourt, Brace printings. The corrections were restored in the Library of America edition of *Main Street & Babbitt* (1992) but many subsequent editions, such as the Bantam paperback published in 1998, continued to be set from flawed earlier printings.\n\nTo secure *Babbitt* Cerf agreed to a three-year reprint contract, after which Harcourt, Brace had the right to cancel the contracts for the ML editions of both *Babbitt* and *Arrowsmith*, with the cancellations to be effective on the same date. He told Harcourt, “I shall be curious to see just how the Pocket Book [mass market paperback] edition of ARROWSMITH affects both your edition and ours of that book!” (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 31 July 1941).\n\nLewis became a RH author in 1939 when he followed his editor Harry Maule from Doubleday to Random House. *Arrowsmith* (243) had been in the Modern Library since 1933, but Lewis wanted to have more of his books in the series. Maule conveyed the good news that *Babbitt* would be added to the series: “Bennett and I thought you might be interested to know that, through some complicated horse-trading, he has finally gotten BABBITT for the Modern Library. I don’t begin to understand the convolutions by which he was able to do this, but he thinks this time it will stick” (Maule to Lewis, 1 August 1941). Lewis was “extremely glad” (Lewis to Maule, 12 August 1941). *Dodsworth* (348) became his third title in the series in 1947.\n\nThe ML edition of *Babbitt* sold 5,807 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in October 1942 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in March 1943.\n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace launched its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, for the burgeoning college market in 1948, it served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for all of Lewis’s titles in the ML (*Arrowsmith*, *Babbitt* and *Dodsworth*) as well as five other Harcourt, Brace titles by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 4,000 copies of *Babbitt* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948). The Harbrace Modern Classics edition of *Babbitt*, printed from the same plates used by the ML, was published in 1950. *Dodsworth* was reprieved; it was never included in Harbrace Modern Classics and the Modern Library edition remained in print until 1970.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\nLewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933–1952) *254*\nLewis, *Dodsworth* (1947–1970) *400*\nLewis, *Cass Timberlane* (1957–1970) *499*\n\n",

Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and profound in its understanding, this story of crime and punishment belongs to no season; it has established a permanent place for itself among the unquestionably important books of our time. Far more than a social document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by whites, it is the story of a hunted human being doomed by forces within and outside himself to be what he is until his very last breath. (*Spring 1942*)\n\n*Jacket A2:* As jacket A1 except in medium gray (265), medium yellow (87), and black.\n\n> Front flap revised with opening sentence replaced by two new sentences and other changes: \n> The publication, in 1940, of Richard Wright’s first novel, *Native Son*, was hailed with high critical praise and with enthusiasm by general readers. But this story of crime and punishment belongs to no season. Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and scrupulous in its search for understanding of the forces that lead to tragedy, this novel is far more than a social document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by whites. It is the drama of a haunted human being doomed by the tensions within and outside himself to be what he is until his very last breath. (*Fall 1954*)\n\nOriginally published by Harper & Bros., 1940, with an introduction by Dorothy Canfield Fisher. The Harper plates were available to the ML but were too large for its format; the ML edition was printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March 1942. *WR* 14 March 1942. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.\n\nCerf expressed interest in a ML edition shortly after *Native Son* was published (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 11 April 1940). Hoyns promised to talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted that Grosset & Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright and for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied that it should be possible for both Grosset & Dunlap and the ML to do the book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on these reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new titles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit of everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940).\n\nThe following year Cerf wrote to Wright hoping to secure his support for a ML edition. He indicated that he wanted to publish *Native Son* in spring 1942 and invited Wright to write an introduction if a ML edition could be arranged (Cerf to Wright, 12 August 1941). Wright did not reply and Cerf wrote again on 3 September 1941. Wright does not appear to have replied to this letter either. In the end the ML reprinted the Fisher introduction from the Harper edition.\n\n*Native Son* sold 7,046 copies during the during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\nHarper’s informed the ML in 1956 that its College Department wanted to include *Native Son* and Richard Hughes’s *High Wind in Jamaica* (239) in Harper Modern Classics, a clothbound series aimed at the textbook market (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper’s, to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Harper’s was willing to allow both titles to remain in the ML, but Klopfer decided to drop them when the stock on hand was exhausted. “They’re not strong enough titles to hang on in competition with your own cloth-bound edition” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956).\n\n",

For a clearer understanding of the role England has played in the world during the last century one has but to study the career of the Prime Minister who shaped her policy. Certainly no writer of of [*sic*; second “of” removed by spring 1952] our time has interpreted the man and his period more faithfully or plainly than André Maurois. His book has a special timeliness at the moment of gravest danger to the British Empire.

The twenty-four stories in this volume represent all her prose work, including her O.

Probably designed by Joseph Blumenthal.\n\n> Front flap:<br> Among philosophers Santayana has earned the tribute of being considered the dramatist of ideas. His many-faceted wisdom, the vast range of his intellectual curiosity and the graceful flow of his style explain why he is one of the most widely read poet–philosophers of modern times. The best and most characteristic of Santayana’s writings in prose and verse are assembled in this volume of 650 pages. Irwin Edman, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, who is responsible for the selection, contributes a brilliant Introductory Essay. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published with Edman’s introductory essay by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for November 1942 but published in September. *WR* 26 September 1942. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1952.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939, but Scribner’s does not appear to have been ready to authorize an inexpensive reprint (Whitney Darrow to Cerf, 17 July 1939). Three years later the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of \\$1,000 against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased to 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available and in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format. Scribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to recover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman edited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional payment for the ML edition.\n\nThe suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came initially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had edited *The Philosophy of William James* (119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former student of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James volume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar collection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the volume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was interested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than \\$250 (Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926). Cerf told him to go ahead, then wrote three months later to cancel the project, noting that he wanted the book but was afraid that Scribner’s would not give the necessary permissions (Cerf to Kallen, 29 November 1926; Cerf to Kallen, 3 March 1927). That summer Cerf indicated to Joseph Ratner, who had written on Santayana’s behalf to inquire about progress on the project, that the collection was out of the question for the time being because of the large number of permissions that would have to be secured from Scribner’s. “We are convinced that just as soon as we approached them on the subject they would turn us down and proceed on such an anthology on their own . . .” (Ratner to Cerf, 8 June 1927; Cerf to Ratner, 11 August 1927). Scribner’s published *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,405 copies by 1 November 1943. Scribner’s published a new and greatly enlarged edition of *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1953 and may have terminated the ML’s reprint contract in anticipation of the appearance of that edition.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\nSantayana, *Sense of Beauty* (1955–1970) 478\n\n",

Told with a fiery intensity and with a magical evocation of the splendors of its Oriental background, this love story stirs the imagination. Its appeal is for everyone who has ever dreamed of far places and the excitement of strange encounters. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by the Century Co., 1921.

Winters, Century Co., to Cerf, 29 September 1930). When the ML edition finally appeared it sold 6,622 copies in its first year, but interest in Byrne was beginning to wane. After *Messer Marco Polo* had been in the series for four years, Cerf indicated that the sales records showed a steady decline. “Evidently Byrne’s books don’t mean very much to readers of today” (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 9 January 1947).\n\n####  356.2. Text reset (1954?)\n\nTitle as 356.1.\n\nPp. [i–iv] v–vi, [1–2] 3–154.

In its own field it is a classic in the tradition of Plato’s *Republic*, Thomas More’s *Utopia* and William Morris’s *News from Nowhere*. Today, while a new world is in the making and everyone is venturing guesses as to its reorganization, this novel is a visionary’s guide to our own future. Its inclusion in the Modern Library series gives new emphasis to the perennial timeliness of Bellamy’s masterpiece. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by Ticknor & Co., 1888. New edition with revisions in the text and the addition of the author’s postscript published by Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1889, to which the Broun introduction was later added. New bibliographical edition without the Broun introduction published by Houghton, Mifflin, 1941. ML edition (pp. [v]–vi, [1]–276) printed from plates previously used for the 1941 Houghton, Mifflin edition with Broun introduction restored. Publication announced for November 1942. *WR* 31 October 1942. First printing: Not established. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML edition was published shortly before *Looking Backward* entered the public domain. By reprinting *Looking Backward* with the permission of Houghton Mifflin and paying royalties of 10 cents a copy, the ML was able to establish its edition in the marketplace before other potential reprinters.\n\n*Looking Backward* sold 10,019 copies by 1 November 1943, placing it high in the first quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 357b.

Here for sustenance in a moment of trial are: Boethius, the sixth-century Roman statesman who offers the consolatory gifts of philosophy; Thomas à Kempis, fifteenth-century German mystic whose book of simple devotional meditations has been an inspiration to Christians of all denominations; Sir Thomas Browne the seventeenth-century English physician whose faith was as sympathetic as it was imaginative. (*Spring 1943*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published February 1943. *WR* 13 March 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nThe Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple Classics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of *The Imitation of Christ* is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M. Dent, 1910). The text of *Religio Medici* probably derives from *The Religio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne* (Everyman’s Library, 1906). \n\nEdman received a \\$500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for his work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000 words that would include discussions of the three individual works. When it arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind of introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the Modern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942). \n\nCerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of Boetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of Chicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical Library was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new one (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942). \n\nJ. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland, noted that *Religio Medici* was on the Index and warned that its inclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised using a different translation of *The Imitation of Christ*. “If you could use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a Protestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this would make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio Medici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November 1942). \n\nEckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his opinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the fact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough literate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point of view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral viewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman to Commins, 11 November 1942). \n\nThe ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943. \n\n",

Written with a deep intensity of emotion, it carries the reader headlong in its current to its final dramatic climax. The spirit of the dead mistress of Manderley hovers over the story, dominating the living until, in the end, her sinister spell is broken forever. As a novel, *Rebecca* won the immediate favor of the reading public and maintained a leading place on the best-seller lists for several seasons.

In addition to the ML they were used by Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press, Blakiston Co., Book League of America, and International Collector’s Library. The 360.2 plates reduced the length of the book by 100 pages by using smaller type and squeezing forty lines of text (five more than 360.1) to the page, thus significantly reducing printing costs. Both sets of plates used by the ML had been designed for full-sized books and in the ML’s compact format produced a type page with uncomfortably narrow margins. \n\n",

The eleven stories that were finally included represented our own idea of a happy compromise: two of them were Overton’s choice and nine of them were ours. Now Grant’s remaining two have been scrapped, along with two of our own, and five new ones substituted. I wish that Grant were here to forgive me. He would say again, I know, “It’s your Library, boys; you know what you want to put into it!” \n> Of the twelve stories in this new edition, my favorite four are “Heart of Darkness,” “The Apple-Tree,” “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” and “The Red Pony,” but the other eight are not far behind them.

It mixes the great with the trivial; long stretches of it seem only pedantic categorizing; other stretches seem rather obvious. The whole is poorly proportioned and badly joined. Between the oases of insight there are desert wastes of pedestrian analysis.” Commins feared that the passage would discourage prospective readers (Commins to Lerner, 25 November 1942); Lerner agreed and it was omitted. \n\nThe ML edition sold 4,319 copies by 1 November 1943. \n\n#### 362b.

Then it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Literature, and ever since has been winning new favor in the eyes of judges of enduring American fiction. This story of New York before it became of age captures the spirit of the metropolis and preserves for us the social history of an era, in the decade of the 1870’s, when elegance and gallantry were on display on gas-lit Fifth Avenue.

Published March 1943. *WR* 13 March 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nThe merger between D. Appleton & Co. and the Century Co. took place in 1933, ten years before the ML edition was published. \n\nThe first ML printing includes all the textual variants noted by Garrison (pp. 230–31) as having been incorporated in the third, fourth, fifth, tenth, and twenty-first Appleton printings except p. 26, line 25, where a semi-colon rather than a comma follows “gone out.” The semi-colon is retained in the 1953 John Lehmann printing, from which the 1967 ML edition (363.2) is reproduced, and in the Library of America edition of *The Age of Innocence* and three other Wharton novels (1985). \n\nGrosset & Dunlap printings from Appleton plates were available in the 1920s and 1930s, first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Popular Copyright Series and subsequently in its Novels of Distinction series (Garrison, p. 235). \n\nThere was a second ML printing of 1,500 copies in July 1943. \n\nThe ML edition sold 4,168 copies by 1 November 1943. Garrison (p. 236) cites a letter that refers to a projected first ML printing of 7,500 copies; given the timing of the second printing and the sales achieved by November 1943 a first printing of 5,000 copies appears more likely. \n\n#### 363.2.

ML edition (263.2, pp. [1], [3], 7–287) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Lehmann edition. The first six lines of the ML title page are reproduced from the Lehmann title page; the 2-line Lehmann imprint is replaced by torchbearer J and the ML imprint. \n\nWyndham’s Introductory Note (Lehmann ed., pp. 5–6) is omitted from the ML edition despite the retention of the title-page statement “With an Introductory Note by | FRANCIS WYNDHAM”. The biographical note on pp. [5–6] of 363.2 is reset and slightly revised from 363.1. \n\nThe ML’s reprint contract was terminated in 1968, possibly because of a reprint edition published that year by Charles Scribner’s Sons. It was estimated that the 6,700 copies of the ML edition then in stock would last about three years. \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n",

Given the leading place on the list as Numbers 1, 2 and 3—Tragedies, Comedies, and Histories and Poems—these volumes of over 1,200, 1,100 and 1,100 pages are scrupulously faithful to the highest standards of scholarship.

Signed: St. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1944*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for November 1943. *WR* 30 October 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nThe ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from *The Complete Works of Shakespeare*, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904), and its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20 vols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and Oxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its text publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text, Commins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the request that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to William T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943). \n\nAt least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the *New Republic*, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very agreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be congratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an omission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right to know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who has done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer, “Editions of Shakespeare,” *New Republic*, 10 January 1944, p. 57). \n\nThe drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated graphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the *Tragedies*, red for the *Comedies*, blue for the *Histories and Poems*). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis Miller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the original jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the second printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25 August 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the proof stage: \n\n> The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is altogether too important a property to be so handicapped. \n> Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets, so that while they are held together by a common thread of recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in other colors. \n> I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam Goldwyn, and give me what I want. \n\nThe length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML to keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World War. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the fall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by different jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the only printings during the war. \n\nThe war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but it took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from wartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be three or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted because of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to Mr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation, which made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95 cents and break even, was an additional complication. \n\nThe Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time each volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume set. \n\n#### 364b.

He wrote to Cerf, “It is impossible to do the Shakespeare in the Modern Library and break even so I have hit on the brilliant scheme of doing the Comedies, Tragedies and Histories in two volumes each, numbered 1 and 1A, 2 and 2A, 3 and 3A. I think we can produce 15,000 sets of these books for October 1st delivery. We can make our normal margin of profit and I think we can sell a good chunk of them this Fall. It will be years until we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the meantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume sets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The printing order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21 May 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July. \n\nEach volume was sold individually. An unfortunate result of splitting the Shakespeare volumes was that the notes and glossary were in the second volume of each two-volume set. \n\n#### 364c.

All three Shakespeare volumes were projected for inclusion in the Illustrated ML but only the *Tragedies* (IML 14) and *Comedies* (IML 15) were published. \n\nThe numbering of the six Shakespeare volumes changed to ML 2–7 in fall 1959 because new business machines acquired by Random House could not handle number-letter combinations. The shift made it necessary to assign new numbers to four other ML titles. *The Modern Library Dictionary* (509) moved from ML 4 to 1, Douglas’s *South Wind* (114) from ML 5 to 304, Ibsen’s *Six Plays* (490) from ML 6 to 305, and *Wisdom of Confucius* (312) from ML 7 to 306. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nShakespeare, *The Tragedies of Shakespeare* (Illustrated ML, 1944–1945) \nShakespeare, *The Comedies of Shakespeare* (1 vol., 1943–1947; 2 vols. 1947–1971; Illustrated ML, 1944–1945) \nShakespeare, *The Histories and Poems of Shakespeare* (1 vol., 1943–1947; 2 vols., 1947–1971) \n\n",

Signed: W.S. [William Sharp]. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The Day family has become a part of our national tradition, and life without Father Day would be very nearly unthinkable. With him, it has been a joy, and sometimes even a trial, but always an enriching and heartwarming adventure. *Life with Father*, as a play, has broken records for continuous performances, and has established itself as a modern American classic. In book form, Clarence Day’s family album is aglow with the spirit of what all of us like best to remember of our own past. (*Spring 1944*) \n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1935. ML edition (pp. [*5*], v–258) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for February 1944; published 17 March 1944. *WR* 25 November 1944. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956. \n\nThe ML paid Knopf a \\$6,000 advance of which \\$2,254 remained unearned in spring 1954. Sharp received \\$75 for the jacket. Freiman wrote him: “Our one regret is that we cannot afford to pay you a fee closer to the true value of your work” (R. A. Freiman to Sharp, 18 November 1943). \n\nLindsay and Crouse, the authors of the Foreword, had written the play based on Day’s book. In November 1943 the play was beginning its fifth year on Broadway; it eventually ran over seven years to become the [longest-running non-musical play on Broadway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_longest-running_Broadway_shows). \n\nCompeting with the ML edition was a reprint edition published in 1943 by Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press. \n\n",

His major work, *Creative Evolution*, embodies his chief contribution to the study of reality as life and change. Influential among philosophers and popular among general readers because of its persuasive argument and vivid illustrations, this book has achieved permanence in the literature of philosophical speculation. It takes an honored place in the Modern Library series as a work of enduring vitality and ever–renewing meaning to succeeding generations of thoughtful readers.

Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nThe ML paid Holt a \\$750 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Cerf first approached Holt he noted, “I have never read Bergson’s CREATIVE EVOLUTION. I am taking Irwin Edman’s word on this one” (Cerf to William Sloan, Holt, 15 March 1943). He offered an advance of \\$1,000 on the assumption that the ML would be able to print from Holt plates, but Sloan discovered that the plates had been melted as part of the war effort. Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with the plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that composition and plates would cost at least \\$500 and suggested reducing the advance from \\$1,000 to \\$750, to which Cerf agreed. Edman received \\$250 for the Foreword (Commins to Edman, 2 December 1943). \n\n#### 368b.

The constant demand for this collection of songs and lyrics and the insistent requests for *The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám* have led the editors of the Modern Library to add the Fitzgerald masterpiece to the Palgrave anthology. The poet and compiler were contemporaries, and the works by which they will always be known appeared within two years of each other. This long-cherished volume is introduced by one of the foremost anthologists of our time, Louis Untermeyer. (Spring *1944*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.

Publication announced for spring 1944. *WR* 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1957. \n\nWatkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s *Anthology of American Negro Literature* (1929) included short stories, selections from novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and autobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories, essays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection represents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s Negro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the Negro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind about his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp. xi–xii). \n\nFor poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have been published in this field: *Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro Poetry for Young Readers*, by Arna Bontemps; *Book of American Negro Poetry*, by James Weldon Johnson; *Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse by Negro Poets*, by Countee Cullen; *Negro Voices, An Anthology of Contemporary Verse*, by Beatrice M. Murphy; *Negro Poets and Their Poems*, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from novels he recommends “that the following novels be read: *Their Eyes Were Watching God*, by Zora N. Hurston; *Home to Harlem*, by Claude McKay; *The Blacker the Berry*, by Wallace Thurman; *My Lives and How I Lost Them*, by Countee Cullen; *These Low Gro*unds, by W. E. Turpin; *Blood on the Forge*, by William Attaway; *Black Thunder*, by Arna Bontemps; *Native Son*, by Richard Wright, and *The White Face*, by Carl R. Offord” (p. xiii). \n\nKeneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to *The Negro Caravan*, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee (Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that *The Negro Caravan* has been highly influential in establishing a canon of African-American literature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that endures. He does not believe the same is true for the *Anthology of American Negro Literature* (1944).

Disbelief does not lay ghosts, nor do the tests of science exorcise them. Stairs creak in the dark with the tread of unseen visitors; cemeteries send up midnight apparitions; and headless horsemen ride in the moonlight. \n> In this completely revised edition of *Famous Ghost Stories*, Bennett Cerf has included such classics of the supernatural as “The Beckoning Fair One,” “The Willows,” “The Supper at Elsinore,” and “The Phantom Rickshaw.” (*Fall 1944*) \n\n> Front flap reset with the following phrase added to the last sentence: <br> “and many other tales of terror and ghostly phenomena.” (*Fall 1959*) \n\n*Jacket B1:* Fujita non-pictorial jacket in deep yellow (85), strong purplish red (255) and black on coated white paper; “Famous” in deep yellow, “Ghost” in reverse, “Stories” in strong purplish red, and other lettering in reverse. \n\n> Front and back flaps:  <br> Perhaps no literary genre has as valid a claim to time-proven distinction as the ghost story; from the ages when men huddled around a fire and exchanged tales to hold back the night, to this day when science is beginning to probe the reaches of man’s mind, the ghost story has held a place of honorable speculation. Whether we scoff or believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling fascination. \n> Bennett Cerf introduces this selection of notable ghost stories that reflect the best of the form. Included are such shiveringly famous tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home, Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human imagination. \n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Best Ghost Stories* (67), which had been in the ML since 1919. Publication announced for spring 1944. *WR* 5 August 1944. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nCerf commented in *SRL*: “Ever since I have had anything to do with the Modern Library, it has included one anthology which struck me as several degrees below par, and that is its collection of ghost stories. This summer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume. The first step in this process, duly recognized by the International Order of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb through all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of numerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library archives” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 28 August 1943, p. 17). \n\nEleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the anthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a flat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4 cents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy. \n\n*Famous Ghost Stories* (IML 17) was also published in the Illustrated Modern Library (1946) with illustrations by Hugo Steiner-Prag and William Sharp. \n\n#### 373b.

Written with the authority of seventeen years of first-hand observation of the revolutionary events in the great centers and remote provinces, it has become required reading for everyone who seeks to understand the role of China in the world today. The author has revised this edition and provided a new introduction and epilogue to bring it up to the present. (*Fall 1944*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1938. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with a new preface and epilogue. Publication announced for fall 1944. *WR* 3 February 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1953. \n\nThe Random House edition was out of print when Snow inquired about a ML reprint (Snow to Cerf, 10 November 1943). The original plates were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November 1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii). \n\nThe original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies. There were six printings of the ML edition with total sales of just over 27,000 copies (Commins to Harold R. Isaacs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 4 September 1956). \n\n#### 374b.

It contains, in addition, a special section, | pages 493 to 511, which brings the history up to the | presidential campaign of 1944. (*Fall 1945 jacket*) \n\n*Jacket A:* Pictorial in deep red (16), grayish olive (110), and black on pale orange yellow (73) paper with decorative illustration of an American eagle; in black and deep red; title in deep red, black, and grayish olive, other lettering in black. Statement at foot of front panel: “With a special chapter by the authors which brings the chronicle up to the summer of 1944.” \n\n> Front flap:<br> For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a concise and compact history of our country which would be both authoritative and eminently readable. In the vast literature of the nation’s development no book so completely and comprehensively fulfills these requirements as the work of Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager, both professors of history at Columbia University. They have provided for this edition a special section which brings their chronicle up to the immediate present. (*Spring 1945*) \n\nOriginally published as *America: The Story of a Free People* by Little, Brown & Co., 1942; reprinted in paperback as *The Pocket History of the United States* (Pocket Books, 1943). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with an added chapter on “The Second World War” (pp. 493–511). Published February 1945. *WR* 24 February 1945. \n\nCerf initially expressed interest in adding a concise history of the United States to the ML in 1940. He wrote to Frank Monaghan, an assistant professor of history at Yale: \n\n> I am crazy to have a clear, concise and up-to-the-minute history of the United States in our Modern Library and wonder if you would be interested in discussing with me the possibility of either writing the book yourself or at least collaborating on such a project. \n> You will be amazed to hear that there is no such book on the market. Thousands of refugees are clamoring for a short history of the country, written without bias and not as a textbook, priced within their reach. In addition, many thousands of native born Americans are more interested in their country today than has ever been the case before (Cerf to Monaghan, 30 October 1940). \n\nMonaghan was interested and described the book he envisioned: “It should have the epic sweep and the implications of Beethoven and Wagner, the salt and twang of a Woody Guthrie ballad. . . . It should be better than Green’s *Short History of the English People*” (Monaghan to Cerf, 24 November 1940). The contract, signed in February 1941, called for the manuscript to be delivered by 1 July 1942. The book was to be published initially as a Random House trade book followed by a ML edition. The contract called for payment of up to \\$1,500 in expenses; Monaghan would receive royalties for the trade edition at the standard sliding scale of 10% of the list price for the first 2,500 copies, 12½% for the next 2,500 copies, and 15% thereafter. Royalties for the ML edition would be 10 cents a copy. \n\nCerf reported in May 1941 that the announcement of Monaghan’s book “caused more enthusiasm than any publicity release that was ever sent out from this office” (Cerf to Monaghan, 1 May 1941). In September Monaghan indicated that the book was half written (Monaghan to Cerf, 22 September 1941). Monaghan received an additional advance of \\$500 in September 1942, but he had many other ongoing projects and the book was never completed. \n\nCerf’s last letter to Monaghan was dated 2 September 1943: \n\n> At the time we discussed the project I remember begging you not to take it on unless you were absolutely sure you could deliver. I impressed upon you the fact that if you couldn’t do the book in time, we would attempt to find somebody else who would. \n> Obviously I made a colossal mistake in judgment when I entrusted this book to you. Had you turned out nothing else since the time you signed the contract, I could have understood your failure to live up to your promise, but I have seen not only your work on Old New York, but that lengthy manuscript on the History of the World that you brought us yourself and that was obviously done on the time that you should have spent finishing the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. \n> It seems to me that the least that you could have done was to tell us that you couldn’t do the job as soon as you decided on taking up your other work, thus giving us the opportunity of finding somebody else to do what we wanted before other publishers beat us to the draw. \n> I simply cannot understand dealings of this sort (Cerf to Monaghan, 2 September 1943). \n\nShortly before Cerf wrote his final letter to Monaghan, Klopfer, who was serving in the U.S. Air Force, wrote to Cerf suggesting “a small illustrated book of the documents of democracy and our own history.” He noted that either Allan Nevins or Henry Steele Commager would do a fine job editing the volume (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p. 87). \n\nThe following month Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of Nevins and Commager’s history, titled *America: The Story of a Free People* in its original edition and *The Pocket History of the United States* in the paperback reprint (Pocket Books, February 1943). Cerf referred to it in *Saturday Review of Literature* as “the best short ‘History of the United States’ on the market” and noted that the Pocket Books edition had sold half a million copies (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 14 August 1943, p. 14). \n\nCerf offered Little, Brown a \\$2,500 advance for a ML edition, but Alfred McIntyre, the president of Little, Brown, indicated that it was selling too well for a ML edition to be considered. In any case, he added, Pocket Books controlled all rights to editions selling for less than two dollars (Cerf to McIntyre, Little, Brown & Co., 17 September 1943; McIntyre to Cerf, 20 September 1943). Cerf’s next step was to offer Pocket Books a \\$4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised to do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to Commager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months for everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an introduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer indicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and royalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962). \n\nSuccessive ML editions of *A Short History of the United States* sold over 100,000 copies prior to 1969. It sold 3,685 copies during November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles during this 12-month period. \n\n#### 376.1b.

It was 21 pages longer than 376.1a. The index, which was also completely reset, increased in length by four pages. \n\nIn Chapter 3, “The Conquest of New France and the Movement for Independence,” the sentence “The second era had for its most prominent feature the missionary activity of a band of devoted men, representing the Franciscans, the Recollects, the Ursulines, and above all the Jesuits” (376.1a, p. 64, line 19), was changed to “activity of a band of devoted people” (376.1b, p. 64, line 19). The change from “men” to “people” reflected the realization that the Ursulines were a teaching order of nuns. \n\nA revised Pocket Books edition containing the new chapter on the Second World War and additional revisions not in ML 376.1b was published in February 1951, but it retained the reading “a band of devoted men” (Pocket Books, rev. ed., 1951, p. 59). \n\nThe “new enlarged edition” (376.2) published in the ML in 1956 was photographically reproduced from the 1956 Pocket Books edition and reverts to the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.2, p. 59). The 5th edition of *A Short History of the United States* (Knopf, 1966), which was reprinted in the ML in 1969, also retains the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.3, p. 63). \n\n#### 376.2.

The authors, both professors of history at Columbia University, are among the most distinguished historians of our time and this book reflects throughout their authoritative knowledge and perspectives.

It also added a bibliography, an additional map (“War in Korea,” p. 532), and a revised index. All of the additions were retained in ML printings. \n\n#### 376.3.

Henry, the editors of this volume first chose those honored unanimously by anthologists and then added several of special interest. The most exacting present-day standards were applied as the final test of admission, with the result that this collection in the truest sense represents America’s favorite story-teller at his mellow, humorous and ironic best. It is with such stories as these that O. Henry earned a permanent place beside the world’s great masters of the short story. (*Spring 1945*) \n\n> Front flap revised:<br> The more than 600 stories written by O. Henry provided an embarrassment of riches for the compilers of this volume. Within the scope of a book of 338 pages, they were guided in their choice by the most exacting present-day standards of admission. The final selection of the thirty-eight stories in this collection offers for the reader’s delight those tales honored almost unanimously by anthologists and those which represent, in variety and balance, the best work of America’s favorite story-teller. They are tales in his most mellow, humorous and ironic moods. They give the full range and flavor of the man, born William Sidney Porter, but known throughout the world as O. Henry, one of the great masters of the short story. (*Spring 1957*) \n\nOriginally published by Sun Dial Press, an imprint of Doubleday, Doran & Co. 1945. ML edition (pp. v–338) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published April 1945. *WR* 5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\n*The Best Short Stories of O. Henry* was a joint venture between the ML and Doubleday, Doran. Van H. Cartmell, who collaborated with Cerf in the 1940s in editing four anthologies of plays that were published in ML Giants, was an associate editor at Doubleday, Doran and editor-in-chief of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary, Garden City Publishing Co. The Sun Dial Press edition appeared first, followed shortly by the ML edition. Doubleday, Doran made the plates, and the ML paid Doubleday a \\$2,000 advance (including \\$100 as a plate rental for five years) against royalties of 10 cents a copy. \n\nRay Freiman, the Random House art director, authorized Sharp to use full color in the jacket illustration. He also asked him to include a hansom cab in the background (Freiman to Sharp, 14 December 1944). \n\nThe ML printed 20,000 jackets in February 1945. The first printing was probably 20,000 as well. Royalties increased by 1971 to 14 cents a copy. *The Best Short Stories of O. Henry* sold 3,850 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. \n\n*The Best Short Stories of O. Henry* was shifted from ML 4 to ML 26 in spring 1959 when *The Modern Library Dictionary* (509) was published as ML 4. \n\n#### 377.2a. Text reset (c. 1959) \n\nTitle as 377.1. \n\nPp.

MAULE”) in black and reverse against moderate olive green (125) panel at top and statement, “Eighteen outstanding stories, including selections by Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Owen Wister . . . .” in reverse and “A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK” in black against moderate olive green panel at foot. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Here are eighteen stories which prove that the “Western” is literature as well as entertainment. In these exciting stories, from Bret Harte and Mark Twain to Walter Van Tilburg Clark, the reader will find outstanding contributions by the authors who broke the ground for innumerable other writers. This collection is designed to follow the development of the Western short story, and it captures the adventurous spirit of the cowboy, the two-gun man, the desert prospector, the gambler, the dance-hall girl, the cattle rustler, the miner, the builder and the nester—all pioneers of the American West. (*Spring 1945*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A in dark olive green (126) with new lettering for title and statement of responsibility in brilliant yellow (83) with “HARRY E. MAULE” in reverse; statement at foot as jacket A except “Eighteen outstanding stories, including selections by Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Owen Wister . . . .” in brilliant yellow. (*Fall 1946*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology; also published as *The Pocket Book of Western Stories* by Pocket Books, Inc., 1945. ML edition published April 1945. *WR* 5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\n*Great Tales of the American West* was a joint venture between the ML and Pocket Books, Inc. The Pocket Books edition, published in June 1945 and printed from plates made from a different typesetting, ran to 320 pages, forty pages shorter than the ML edition. It omitted Robert Easton’s “To Find a Place” (ML ed., pp. 331–61) but the content of the two editions was otherwise identical. The composition and manufacturing costs for each set of plates was split equally between Pocket Books and the ML. Maule, a RH editor, received a \\$250 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy on the ML edition. \n\nHal Borland’s review of the ML edition in the *New York Times Book Review* noted the absence of Will James, Andy Adams, and B. M. Bower. Maule had tried to get something by James but the estate was tied up with legal problems and had been unable to grant permission. Adams and Bower wrote no short stories and Maule did not want to include selections from novels. In a letter to Borland he noted, “There is another omission which we are correcting because the Modern Library feels that the permanence of the volume justifies the trouble and expense. Through a mix-up I failed to include a WOLFVILLE story by Alfred Henry Lewis but I am in touch with the estate now, and the next printing will have one” (Maule to Borland, 3 July 1945). \n\nNo story by Lewis was ever included. The inflation that followed the Second World War together with relatively slow sales of Maule’s anthology may have ruled out incurring additional costs for permissions, typesetting, and plate making. \n\nUnlike *Great Modern Short Stories* (361) and *Best American Humorous Stories* (380), *Great Tales of the American West* did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n",

Signed: Riki. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Howard Fast stands foremost among the younger generation of writers in America. His historical novels of the critical first years of the Republic have been notable for their insight and dramatic impact; their heroes are motivated by a deep but simple humanity, and their dedication to man’s struggle for liberty has made his books unique contributions to an understanding of the forces and personalities that shaped our nation. Carl Van Doren says: “Reading *The Unvanquished* is the next thing to having been on the scene at the time.” (*Fall 1945*) \n\nOriginally published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1942. ML edition (pp. [*7–10*], 3–316) printed from Duell, Sloan and Pearce plates with page numerals removed from table of contents and newly drawn maps added on pp. [*12–13*] to replace the endpaper maps of the original edition. Published fall 1945. *WR* 3 November 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1952. \n\nCharles Duell suggested a ML edition of Fast’s *Conceived in Liberty* in 1942. Cerf responded that it wouldn’t have a chance in the ML but that Fast’s recently published novel *The Unvanquished* would be a different matter (Duell to Cerf, 18 December 1942; Cerf to Duell, 24 December 1942). The reprint contract was signed two-and-a-half years later, in May 1945. \n\nFour years after *The Unvanquished* was added to the ML, Fast contacted Cerf about a rumor that the novel and his volume devoted to Tom Paine in ML Giants (G69) were being dropped from the series. Fast had joined the Communist Party in 1944 and in recent testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities had refused to reveal the names of contributors to a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War (“Howard Fast,” *Wikipedia*, accessed 27 July 2010). He wrote: \n\n> I do hope I am needlessly perturbed, but I thought it best to write you and ask whether the rumor that my books have been dropped from the Modern Library has any basis in fact. It came to me from several places in the industry that you were cleaning people like myself out of the Modern Library, and that two of the initial adjustments were THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE. \n> I don’t have to tell you that I find this most difficult to believe. Whatever our political differences have been—and they have been very considerable—I always considered you a person of independence and integrity. I cannot believe that any circumstances would cause you to give aid and comfort to the unspeakable group of people who both fear and hate books, and attack them. (Fast to Cerf, 7 December 1949). \n\nCerf replied: \n\n> The rumor you quote in your letter of December 7th to the effect that your books were going to be dropped from the Modern Library because “we were cleaning people like yourself out of the series” is 100% incorrect. I would be interested in learning where you heard this rumor. . . . \n> Your THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE were added to the Modern Library because we believed they belonged there. Any opinions that we may have of your political ideas, or you personally, do not alter those beliefs in any degree whatsoever. The only thing that will ever make us drop either or both of these books from the series is a drop-off in general sales so marked as to make their retention no longer desirable from a commercial point of view (Cerf to Fast, 9 December 1949). \n\n*The Unvanquished* was dropped from the ML in fall 1952, presumably because of poor sales. *The Selected Work of Tom Paine*, edited by Fast, coupled with Fast’s novel *Citizen Tom Paine* (G69), remained in ML Giants until 1970. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nFast, Howard, *Citizen Tom Paine*; *The Selected Work of Tom Paine*, ed.

His work on *Best American Humorous Short Stories* was not part of his regular responsibilities, and he received a \\$250 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy (Cerf to Linscott, 19 January 1945). Jessup’s anthology had an average sale of 1,500–2,000 copies a year before the Second World War. Linscott expected the revised edition to sell over 5,000 copies in the first year and then gradually decline to the same level as the earlier anthology. He predicted a total sale of 20,000–30,000 copies before it needed to be revised again (Linscott to R. Hawley Traux, *New Yorker*, 1 March 1945). \n\n*Best American Humorous Short Stories* sold 3,643 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. \n\n",

Contents as 381a except: [iv] Copyright, 1936, by Random House, Inc. (*Fall 1945*) *Note:* The correction in the copyright date was made because Hart’s introduction was initially written for the limited edition of *Two Years before the Mast* printed by the Grabhorn Press in San Francisco and published by Random House in 1936. \n\n*Jacket* *A:* Pictorial in dark blue (183) and medium gray (264) on coated cream paper with inset multi-color illustration adapted from the poster for the 1946 film version starring Alan Ladd and Brian Donlevy; lettering in dark blue on medium gray panels above and below illustration; all surrounded by dark blue background. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The test of time by which classics are proved has certainly been applied to Richard Henry Dana’s *Two Years Before the Mast*, for it is now just over one hundred years since it was first published. During that century it has constantly risen in the admiration of succeeding generations of readers, and today is as revered as a masterpiece of the literature of the sea as it ever has been in all its long history. It takes an honored place in the Modern Library series, introduced by James Hart of Harvard University. (*Spring 1945*) *Note:* There was a second printing. \n\n*Jacket B1:* Pictorial on cream paper in light blue (181), light yellow 86), light orange yellow (70) and black with inset illustration of clipper ship at dock and title and author in reverse against light blue background and series in black. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1946*) \n\n> Flap: <br> “James D. Hart of the University of California” fall 1948; “of Harvard University” fall 1954 sans serif type, later corrected (F55) \n\nML edition based on the text of the limited edition of 1,000 copies printed by Edwin and Robert Grabhorn in San Francisco and published by Random House, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published summer 1945 (publication originally announced for fall 1944 and then for spring 1945). *WR* 4 August 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nJames D. Hart, the author of the Foreword, had suggested a ML edition of *Two Years before the Mast* in 1935 and indicated that it would have a steady sale to schools and colleges (Hart to Cerf, 19 February 1935). Later that year Cerf offered Hart \\$75 to write an introduction to the Grabhorn Press edition with the understanding that the introduction could also be used in due course in a ML edition (Cerf to Hart, 12 November 1935). Hart also advised Edwin and Robert Grabhorn about the best edition to use as a copy-text when setting their edition. \n\nHart stated in his introduction to the Grabhorn edition, “The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life, and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote ‘twenty-four years after.’ To this have been added the concluding chapter of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p. [xiv]). The second sentence is altered in ML ed. as follows: “To this have been added the preface and epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p. [xiv]). The preface appears in both the Grabhorn and ML editions; the epilogue (titled “Concluding Memorandum” in the Grabhorn edition) appears on pp. 413–23 of the ML edition as part of “Twenty-four Years After.” The concluding chapter referred to in Hart’s introduction to the Grabhorn edition is omitted from 381a. The ML edition also omitted the penultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding chapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided incorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the events as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I shall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have been suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4). \n\nThe film of *Two Years before the Mast* starring Alan Ladd was released by Paramount Pictures in April 1945. It is possible that publication of the ML edition was postponed to coincide with the release of the film. \n\nThe last paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381a reads as follows: \n\n> The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote “twenty-four years after.” To this have been added the preface and the epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account. (p. xiv) \n\n*Two Years before the Mast* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n#### 381b. “Concluding Chapter” added (1954) \n\nTitle as 381a. \n\nPp.

(*Fall 1966*) \n\n*Jacket B2:* As 381a jacket B except flap text as jacket B except for last sentence. (*Fall 1954*) *Note:* The ML began using sans serif type on the flaps and back panel of jackets in fall 1953. When the jacket for *Two Years before the Mast* was reset in sans serif type, the ML’s printers appear to have copied the flap text from jacket A, and the last sentence reverts to “James D. Hart of Harvard University.” (*Fall 1954*). \n\n*Jacket B3:* As jacket B2 with flap text corrected to “James D. Hart of the University of California.” (*Fall 1955*) \n\n*Jacket B4*: As jacket B3 except on coated white paper. (*Spring 1957*) \n\nThe last paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381b is revised as follows: \n\n> The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote “twenty-four years after.” As preface and epilogue there have been appended the original opening of Chapter I and the Concluding Chapter of the first edition. These sections were omitted in later revisions but they have great value in giving further insight into the purposes of Dana’s book. (p. xiv) \n\nThe earliest printing examined with the Concluding Chapter (pp. 387–406) has a fall 1954 jacket, but the Concluding Chapter may have been added earlier. \n\n",

Printed in six colors. Designed by Nat Farmer; unsigned. \n\n> Front flap:<br> In the proud re-discovery of our past, Americans are turning with more and more enthusiasm to our first renowned national literary figure. Because Washington Irving’s writings retain their freshness and excitement, they are having a renaissance a century after they had reached the crest of their popularity during his lifetime. This comprehensive volume of 700 pages offers generous selections, each given in its entirety, from *The Sketch Book*, *Bracebridge Hall*, *Tales of a Traveller*, *The Alhambra*, *Wolfert’s Roost*, and the unabridged *Knickerbocker’s History of New York*. (*Fall 1945*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A in light brown and black on coated white paper with oval illustration and frame in black and white; all lettering in reverse on light brown background. Printed in four colors. (*Probably fall 1947 or spring 1948*; *Spring 1958* *examined*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1945. *WR* 17 November 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nCerf authorized Commins to prepare a volume of Irving’s writings for the ML in August 1944. Commins was to provide an introduction, and the length of the book was to be no more than 700 pages. Commins submitted a preliminary table of contents about seven weeks later, noting that he proposed to include Irving’s burlesque *History of New York* by Diedrich Knickerbocker in complete form. “First, it’s the best thing he wrote and his greatest fame rests on it. Second, and very important, it is a wonderful selling point to be able to say that we give the History complete and unabridged. . . . The History is hard to get outside conventional sets of Irving.” Commins received a \\$250 advance against royalties of 3 cents for every copy sold in the ML (Cerf to Commins, 17 August 1944, Commins to Cerf, 5 October 1944; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library). \n\nCerf announced the forthcoming publication of *Selected Writings of Washington Irving* in his “Trade Winds” column six months before the book was published. He stated, “The editors of the Modern Library expect it to be one of the most popular volumes in the entire series” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 12 May 1945, p. 17). \n\nJacket B was printed in four instead of six colors and appears to have been introduced in 1947 or early 1948. Ray Freiman asked Nat Farmer, the artist responsible for the original ML jacket, to devise a color scheme utilizing four colors, indicating that the ML could not afford six-color printing in 1947 (Freiman to Farmer, 9 May 1947). \n\n*Selected Writings of Washington Irving* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n",

The forty-five tales in the 550 pages of this volume represent the flower of his work, [+work in the field of the short story, each] chosen with the purpose of giving variety, balance and sustained interest [+to the whole]. These stories [±tales] are as vital and as applicable [±meaningful] today as they were when they were first written during the feverish ten years of Maupassant’s creative life [+, from 1883 to 1893]. (*Fall 1946; [Spring 1956]*). *Note:* Fall 1945 jacket not seen. \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A in vivid red (11) and dark blue (183) on coated white paper with lettering in reverse on vivid red panel at top, other lettering in reverse on smaller dark blue panel at foot, with a rule in reverse separating the panels. Front flap with spring 1956 text. (*Fall 1963*) *Note:* The elimination of a third color meant that the jacket was cheaper to print, but the inset backstrip panel with “DE MAUPASSANT” is unframed, making the backstrip less distinctive. \n\n> The flaps and back panel of the jacket are also printed in vivid red and dark blue. \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding *The Best Stories of Guy de Maupassant*, translated by Michael Monahan (1932). Published fall 1945. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\n*The Best Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* was originally entrusted to Aaron Sussman, a partner in the firm that handled Random House’s advertising, and Whit Burnet, the editor of *Story* magazine. They were unable to complete the volume, perhaps because Sussman’s advertising agency was reorganized in 1944 from Franklin Spier & Aaron Sussman to Sussman & Sugar. Commins took over the editing of the volume and received a flat fee of \\$300 for his efforts—the same amount that had been offered to Sussman and Burnet (Cerf to Commins, 26 January 1945; Saxe Commins Papers, Princeton University Library). \n\nCommins used the anonymous translations in *The Life and Work of Henri Rene Guy de Maupassant* (17 vols., M. W. Dunne, 1903) because they were in the public domain. The alternative was to use translations by several hands with many copyright complications (Commins to Alfred A. Knopf, 21 February 1950). \n\nCommins’s edition of *The Best Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nMaupassant, Guy de, *Best Stories*, trans.

A tremendous influence on subsequent writing, it is as meaningful for our generation as it was before, during and immediately after the French Revolution. The very voice of the enlightenment, it speaks with the same eloquence for every enlightened reader today. The inclusion of *The Confessions*, complete and unabridged, in the Modern Library series fulfills a long-cherished plan of the editors. (*Spring 1946*) *Note:* The jacket illustration is credited to Steiner-Prag on the front flap; Joseph Blumenthal was responsible for the typographic design. (*Spring 1946*) \n\nThe ML did not know the identity of the translator. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Scheduled for fall 1945; published February 1946. *WR* 9 February 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\n*The Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau* was scheduled for publication in fall 1945, and the verso of the title page of the first printing states “FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION, 1945.” However, its listing in *Publishers’ Weekly*’s “Weekly Record” of newly published books is in the issue for 9 February 1946, and there is a spring 1946 list of ML titles inside the first printing of the jacket. Publication may have been delayed by the wave of strikes that accompanied the return to a peacetime economy (*see* Neavill, “Publishing in Wartime,” *Library Trends* 55 [Winter 2007], p. 593; <http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/slisfrp/62>). Klopfer remarked later in 1946, “We are having the usual hellish time getting our books out and the situation amongst the suppliers is certainly no easier than it was at any time during the war” (Klopfer to Cerf, 14 August 1946). \n\nThe ML edition was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.

(*Spring 1951*) *Note:* *Darkness at Noon* had been a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1941. The wording of the jacket may have been revised to avoid the suggestion that it was a current selection. \n\n> Front flap revised with first sentence beginning “Few modern novels have stirred up” and the following sentence added at the end: “Recent history has provided corroborating testimony to his fictional critique of the ruthlessness of modern revolutionary procedures.” (*Fall 1956*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1941. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–267) printed from Macmillan plates. Publication scheduled for February 1946. *WR* 16 March 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. \n\nKostler wrote *Darkness at Noon* in German while living in Paris. The sculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was Koestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris separately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once she was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of *Darkness at Noon* with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August 2013). \n\nCerf initially wanted to publish *Darkness at Noon* in the ML in fall 1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I think it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do well with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12 January 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for fall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on the grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our relations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam, Macmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML edition in spring 1943, offering an advance of \\$500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942). \n\n*Darkness at Noon* was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club for June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years later, the ML jacket stated “*The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection*”; in the early 1950s the wording was changed to “*A Book-of-the-Month Club Selection*”. \n\n*Darkness at Noon* sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. \n\n",

Signed: VA [Valenti Angelo]. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Of the new generation of novelists, risen to prominence during the Second World War, no one stands higher than John Hersey. In *A Bell for Adano* he has given the first fictional, and so far the most eloquent, American interpretation of the struggle of democracy against fascism. He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world. (*Spring 1946*) \n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp. [1]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. *WR* 27 April 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956. \n\nThe ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a copy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when the ML increased its list price to \\$1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A Pocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945. \n\nHersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in place of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar rather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins: \n\n> For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began: “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.” \n> On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two things. \n> One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . . \n> The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men, when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones, when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii). \n\nCommins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever to appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November 1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in the Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not “consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere else” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf edition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint editions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more than thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued. \n\nCopies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of the volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and jacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author stamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and title printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is indicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used on ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as regular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for the use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown. \n\nThe ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n",

Signed: PG [Paul Galdone]. \n\n> Front flap:<br> For many years the editors of the Modern Library have tried to acquire the rights of publication of the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Now, by special arrangement with the Estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes*, complete and unabridged in one volume and comprising twenty-three of the greatest tales to come from the pen of the master, is offered as the classic in its field. Here for your mystification and delight are “The Red-Headed League,” “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” “The Five Orange Pips” and others of equal fame and favor. (*Spring 1946*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for February 1946. *WR* 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably 10,000 copies. \n\nCerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about including *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* in the ML. He offered a \\$2,500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and make new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a way of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 April 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred Cerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle Estate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being difficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a period of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible limitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes stories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944). \n\nKlopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with Watt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped its proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a three-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt to drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML would be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is included in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, pp. 195–98). He also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a \\$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was considering putting *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* into the Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that, although the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years and he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at ten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed to a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five years. \n\nVincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the ML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I would rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of the American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty corrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was published without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a first printing of 10,000 copies. \n\nThe ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. \n\n#### 387b.

The simple truth is that he is inimitable. He is [+original, he is] funny and he is profound; he is clever and he is surprisingly penetrating; there are always both rhyme and reason in his sensible nonsense. For this Modern Library edition, Ogden Nash has made his own selection of 165 of his most representative poems, each one a gem of humor and light-hearted wisdom. (*Spring 1946; [Fall 1956]*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A in vivid red (71) instead of strong orange and grayish brown (61) instead of light grayish brown. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A fall 1956.

Discontinued fall 1968, four years after Nash’s *Verses from 1929 On* (1964) was added to the ML. \n\nCerf first inquired about a volume of Nash’s poems in 1943, remarking: “We are veering more and more to the classics in the Modern Library, but we have to put in an occasional modern volume to keep up appearances” (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 1 October 1943). At that time Little, Brown did not want to authorize another reprint edition of Nash’s poems. Garden City Publishing Co. was doing well with its one-dollar reprint of *The Face Is Familiar: The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash*, and *The Ogden Nash* *Pocket Book* was scheduled to appear as a 25-cent paperback early the following year (McIntyre to Cerf, 2 October 1943). The Garden City reprint, published in 1941, eventually went through fifteen printings for a total of 172,500 copies; the Pocket Books volume had nine printings through January 1946 for a total of 765,000 copies (Crandell, pp. 58–60, 76). \n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy to Little, Brown & Co. In 1957 Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown noted that the ML was still paying royalties of 10 cents a copy although the retail price had been increased several times (Thornhill to Klopfer, 17 September 1957). Royalties appear to have been increased to 12 cents a copy. \n\n*The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash* sold 5,332 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n",

Considered by its author the most ambitious, by his critics the most perceptive and by his ever-growing circle of devotees his most highly sustained novel, it is given a distinguished place in the Modern Library series beside two of his widely read works: *The Portrait of a Lady*, Number 107, and *The Turn of the Screw*, Number 169. (*Fall 1946*) \n\n*Jacket* *B:* As 389.1 except deep reddish brown (41) in place of dark red and pale yellow (89) in place of yellowish gray on coated cream paper. (*Fall 1964*) \n\nOriginally published in two volumes by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1902. ML edition (381.1, pp. [1]–329; [1]–439) printed from Scribner plates in a single volume with title retained in the heading of v. 1, p. 3 and removed from the heading of vol. 2, p. 3; “Preface” printed from a new typesetting. Publication announced for September 1946. *WR* 16 November 1946. First printing: Not ascertained but probably 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1969/70. \n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a \\$400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the assumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML that *The Wings of the Dove* did not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve large reprint sales. \n\nJames’s Preface (pp. v–xxii) originally appeared in the New York Edition of *The Novels and Tales of Henry James* (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1907–17), in which *The Wings of the Dove* occupied vols. 19–20. The New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type. The ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s edition and made plates that were used for ML printings. \n\nFour years before *The Wings of the Dove* was added to the ML, Cerf admitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf to Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote, “According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a motion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the Dove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make a timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report, however, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is one of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than Faulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political dissertations” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, June 20, 1942, p. 20). \n\n*The Wings of the Dove* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1952–October 1952. In contrast, James’s *Portrait of a Lady* (1936) was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles, and *Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* (1930) was near the top of the second quarter. \n\n#### 389.2.

Signed: “brenner” at upper right. \n\n> Front flap:<br> In response to an ever-increasing number of written suggestions that there be a larger representation of the novels of Balzac in the Modern Library, the editors have chosen for inclusion in the series two of his most famous works of fiction: *Père Goriot* and *Eugénie Grandet*. In brand-new translations, the first by E. K. Brown of Chicago University, and the second by Dorothea Walter and John Watkins, this portion of the massive structure of the Human Comedy belongs among the world’s greatest novels of creative imagination and social criticism. (*Fall 1946*) \n\nOriginal ML translations. Publication announced for September 1946. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nE. K. Brown of Cornell University suggested that the ML needed a volume of Balzac in addition to *Droll Stories* (221), which he considered unrepresentative. “You have Stendhal, Flaubert and Maupassant, why not Balzac?” (Brown to Cerf, 26 March 1943). Cerf commissioned him to modernize existing English translations of *Père Goriot* and *Eugénie Grandet* and to write an introduction. Brown agreed to a fee of \\$300 and promised the manuscript within five months (Cerf to Brown, 25 August 1943). Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the Balzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the library which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four months later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were needed (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the existing translations were probably very bad and favored doing new translations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we pay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to advertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February 1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should tell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this point Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown, 10 February 1944). \n\nBrown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed work on the translation of *Eugénie Grandet*. In December he suggested John Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4 December 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent \\$300 each to Brown and Watkins. The financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and Brown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that \\$500 would be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he initially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being unreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually accepted the \\$300 fee. \n\n*Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet* did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n#### 390b.

Brown inserted three paragraphs of biographical information after the opening paragraph of the introduction. The additions to the introduction extended its length by a page, and the bibliography occupied an additional two pages. By using the blank page that followed the introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96 occupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to incorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length of the volume. The title page was completely reset, and Brown’s introduction was credited for the first time on the title page. \n\nBrown also supplied a list of errors and misprints that appeared on eight pages of the text. The plates were patched to correct the errors. \n\n",

It is a novel of living characters in an unforgettable setting, with a wisdom as simple as it is tender and a charm as natural as it is winning. The story of Jody Baxter and his pet fawn is American folklore at its best. *The Yearling* is a novel that stirs the heart with its understanding of boyhood and its love of life. (*Fall 1946*) \n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1938. New bibliographical edition with illustrations by N. C. Wyeth published as “Pulitzer Prize Edition,” 1939, and in Scribner Illustrated Classics for Younger Readers, 1940. ML edition (pp. 1–400) printed from offset lithographic plates photographically reduced from the 1939 Scribner edition with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September 1946. *WR* 4 January 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1954. \n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s royalties of 10 cents a copy on all copies sold over 30,000. The royalty on the first 30,000 copies appears to have been reduced or waived to cover the cost of making offset plates. Sales appear to have exceeded 30,000 copies since the ML paid Scribner’s royalties of \\$235 on sales of 2,355 copies sold after 30 October 1953 (Klopfer to Ruth Riggs, Scribner’s, 16 July 1954). \n\nThe ML’s reprint contract was limited to six years. After receiving a report of sales through October 1953 and noting that *The Yearling* was included on the ML’s spring 1954 list, Whitney Darrow of Scribner’s reminded Cerf that the book was supposed to have been dropped from the series by October 1952 (Darrow to Cerf, 19 April 1954). Klopfer replied that *The Yearling* had stayed on the spring 1954 list by mistake and as a result it had not been necessary to remainder any copies. He assured Darrow that it was out of stock and would be replaced on the fall list by Aristotle’s *Rhetoric & Poetics* (Klopfer to Darrow, 20 April 1954). \n\n*The Yearling* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1952–October 1953. \n\n",

The events of his life and the circumstances under which he wrote his majestic music are presented with the purpose of giving the general reader a faithful portrait. In addition, more than one hundred of the works are analyzed so that the concertgoer, phonograph enthusiast and the radio listener will have program notes, with appraisals and interpretations. The author, John N. Burk, is the historian of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. (*Fall 1946*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1943.

Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nBurk was a music historian affiliated with the Boston Symphony. His program notes about works being performed were included in the printed programs, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on Boston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’s *Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography* in 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf and Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins suggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and one-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works (Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by Random House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML edition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter. \n\n*The Life and Works of Beethoven* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. It sold about 2,000 copies a year in the mid-1950s; Cerf reported in 1960 that it sold “only moderately well” (Cerf to Selden Rodman, 8 June 1960). \n\nBurk indicated that his typescript was almost exactly 100,000 words and that his first choice of someone to write an introduction was Aaron Copeland, with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony, as another possibility (Burk to Commins, 13 July 1942 and 27 November 1942; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library).

Associated generally with New England, his works have transcended sectional limitations and have become the lyrical voice of the entire land. Not only has Robert Frost chosen 230 of his 270 published poems [±230 of his poems for this collection], but he also contributes a personal credo in the form of an Introductory Essay, “The Constant Symbol,” and a new sonnet written especially for this volume. (*Fall 1946; [Spring 1955]*) \n\nOriginal ML collection published by arrangement with Henry Holt & Co. Published November 1946. *WR* 14 December 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1963. \n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in 1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later Robert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the year, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated that the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid for and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost \\$100 to write an introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944). It took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the delay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan conveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include every poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of Frost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and Pocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). *The Pocket Book of Robert Frost’s Poems* was published in 1946 and *The Complete Poems of Robert Frost* (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern Library contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a \\$1,500 advance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract was for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless terminated by Holt with six months’ written notice. \n\nLinscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in *The Collected Poems of Robert Frost* (Holt, 1939) and *A Witness Tree* (Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott to Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided that he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four of the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had left out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to Mr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by way of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but instead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13 December 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four poems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The Mountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter Night,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue Ribbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking with Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the contents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only “The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection. Linscott agreed to pay Frost \\$250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages (Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The Constant Symbol,” was also published in *Atlantic Monthly* (October 1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost appended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction. \n\n*The Poems of Robert Frost* sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. \n\nNo details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been ascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt, Rinehart & Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in 1963. \n\n",

(*Spring 1963*) \n\n*The Sound and the Fury* originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1929; *As I Lay Dying* originally published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1946. *WR* 7 December 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by separate ML editions of *The Sound and the Fury* (1966) and *As I Lay Dying* (1967). \n\nFaulkner’s *Sanctuary* (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only Faulkner title in the series until the addition of *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a Random House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave Random House publishing rights to *The Sound and the Fury* (1929), *As I Lay Dying* (1930), *Sanctuary* (1931), *Light in August* (1932), and *Pylon* (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread critical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s subsequent works, including *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936), *The Unvanquished* (1938), *The Wild Palms* (1939), *The Hamlet* (1940), and *Go Down, Moses* (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s novels except *Soldier’s Pay* (Boni & Liveright, 1926), *Mosquitoes* (Boni & Liveright, 1927) and *Sartoris* (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it took ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf and Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML. \n\nFaulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published *The Portable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published *The Sound and the Fury* & *As I Lay Dying* in a single volume. The two volumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of Faulkner’s stature in the United States. \n\nEvelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been interested in publishing a ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay Dying* in the early 1930s but took *Sanctuary* instead because plates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles (Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and 1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a second printing than to make plates—and plates were available for *Sanctuary*. \n\nLinscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint of *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (Linscott to Cowley, 31 December 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider *As I Lay Dying* to be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way below” *Light in August*. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the two works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see *The Sound and the Fury* and *Light in August* reprinted separately. He continued: \n\n> Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I don’t think that’s such a good idea either. [In its list for fall and winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited edition of *The Sound and the Fur*y with the text in three colors and a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.] But for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix? (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946). \n\nCowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley that the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to write an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945 The Compsons” that Faulkner had written for *The Portable Faulkner*. Cowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing permission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on: \n\n> Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,” having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel. His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow— either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer, because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or else hijack a copy from some friend. \n> I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack [*sic*], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business [see G68]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux, perhaps, now writing in any language. . . . \n> I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels. I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too, under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an end paper [paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as a frontispiece]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry. \n> I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book [*The Portable Faulkner*]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 [i.e., 1946]; underlining in original). \n\nLinscott replied: \n\n> I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . . \n> I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back. \n> Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more likely to want to read the other. \n> On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott to Cowley, 15 February 1946). \n\nIn the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The ML printed his Appendix from *The Portable Faulkner* with minor revisions, placing it at the beginning of *The Sound and the Fury*, referring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by the author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was superseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume (pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four novels (*Soldiers’ Pay*, *Mosquitoes*, *Flags in the Dust*, and *The Sound and the Fury*), published in 2006, also prints the appendix “Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of *The Sound and the Fury* (pp. 1127–41). \n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* sold 10,640 copies during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh best-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American writer and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more than 10,000 copies at this period: \n\n> Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930) 11,563 \n> Aquinas, *Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas* (1948) 11,129 \n> Aristotle, *Introduction to Aristotle* (1947) 11,114 \n> Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (Giant, 1931) 11,111 \n> Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 10,943 \n> Freud, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1938) 10,669 \n> Faulkner, *Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (1946) 10,640 \n> Plato, *Works of Plato* (1930) 10,302 \n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was almost the ML’s sixth best-selling title. *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* outsold the Faulkner volume by twenty-nine copies. \n\nFaulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years after the publication of *The Portable Faulkner* and the ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*.

It is a cure for nearly everything that ails a melancholy world. The knife of Perelman’s wit and wisdom is sharpened on the boot of satire. The incomparable parodist, he takes a cut at books, advertising, magazines, publishers, the movies, columnists, socialites and even himself—and they are [+all] the better for his keen scalpel and deft hand. Perelman is at his best in this book of fifty [+hilarious] pieces, each one warranted [+as a tonic to your sense of humor and guaranteed] to keep you healthy with laughter. (*Spring 1947*) [*Spring 1957*] \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1944, as *Crazy Like a Fox*. ML edition (pp. 3–269) printed from RH plates with minor revisions suggested by Perelman, running heads omitted, dedication to Robert C. Benchley added, and the table of contents reset in the style of the Random House edition to reflect the addition of the introduction and four stories on pp. 270–300. Page numerals (vii–viii) were added to the reset table of contents. Publication announced for January 1947. *WR* 10 May 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Reprinted (pp. [v]–xiv, 3–300) in Vintage Books, May 1973, using offset lithographic plates photographically reduced from the ML edition, with title, half title, and fly title reverting to *Crazy Like a Fox*. \n\nThe ML paid Perelman royalties of 10 cents a copy, double the rate specified for a ML reprint in the Random House contract (Perelman to Cerf, 22 September 1946). Perelman wrote a new introduction for the ML edition under the name “Sidney Namlerep” and sent four additional pieces: “Physician, Steel Thyself,” “Pale Hands I Loathe,” “Insert Flap ‘A’ and Throw Away,” and “Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer.” He hoped that the additional pieces could be inserted within the text rather than added at the end but recognized that that might not be possible since *Crazy Like a Fox* plates were being used. He also asked to change the dedication from “For Laura and Abby Laura” (his wife and daughter) to “To Robert C. Benchley” (Perelman to Klopfer, 2 December 1946). The dedication in the Random House edition was printed on the verso of the title page; the dedication to Benchley in the Modern Library edition appeared on a leaf of its own. \n\nPerelman suggested McKnight Kauffer as the jacket designer for the ML edition. Five years earlier, after meeting with Saxe Commins in connection with his forthcoming book *The Dream Department* (Random House, 1943), he commented, “On the way out after leaving you, I looked at some of McKnight Kauffer’s jackets for Modern Library titles. He’s wonderful; I really would love to have him do a jacket for the book if it could be arranged” (Perelman to Commins, “Tuesday” [6 October 1942]). Kauffer designed the jackets for *The Dream Department* and the Random House trade edition of *Crazy Like a Fox* as well as the jacket for the ML edition. \n\nPerelman also emphasized that it was important to proofread *Crazy Like a Fox* carefully, and he asked for several changes in the text, of which the most notable was changing “total recall” to “O’Hara’s disease” (p. 53). Other changes included changing “rif ling” to “riffling” (p. 47), “jack boots” to “jackboots” (p. 88), and “compound fracture” to “greenstick fracture” (p. 184). \n\nNegotiations concerning the publication of *The Best of S. J. Perelman* between Cerf and Perelman’s agent, Alan Collins of Curtis Brown, Ltd., were not harmonious. Prior to publication Cerf wrote Collins: “I would like to state here very clearly that we will carry out our contract for the Perelman anthology in the Modern Library and that, thereafter, we have not the faintest interest in future writings by Mr. Perelman” (Cerf to Collins, 18 November 1946). \n\nRandom House published five books by Perelman between 1937 and 1946. His next book was published by Reynal & Hitchcock; thereafter he settled into a long-term publishing relationship with Simon & Schuster. \n\n",

A book for students and general readers alike, this volume provides in its almost 700 pages the Posterior Analytics (Logic), De Anima (On the Soul), Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics, complete and unabridged, as well as generous selections from Physics, Metaphysics, and Politics. The interpretive introductions by Richard McKeon are helpful guides through the ever-new world of Aristotle’s ideas. (*Spring 1947*) \n\n*Jacket A2:* As jacket A1 with the designer’s name omitted. (*Fall 1961*) *Note:* There are two versions of the jacket, one with the designer’s name RIKI on the deep orange yellow panel, the other without the designer’s name. The earliest noted without the designer’s name dates from 1957. Some later printings of the jacket include the designer’s name, others omit it. \n\nOriginal ML collection drawn from *The Basic Works of Aristotle*, ed. Richard McKeon (Random House, 1941). All of the translations were originally published by Oxford University Press. Publication announced for January 1947. *WR* 12 April 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nMcKeon edited the *Basic Works of Aristotle* without a contract and was unhappy with the financial arrangements he was offered when it was completed. He had undertaken the collection hoping that it could be published as a ML Giant and was prepared to accept a flat fee of \\$500 if it was published in an inexpensive format suitable for classroom use. “I made it abundantly clear, in conversation,” he wrote later, “that in the event that a larger price was to be charged for the volume, I would consent to do it only on the basis of a continuing royalty payment” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). He was informed after he submitted the manuscript that it could not be published as a Giant, and Cerf rejected the royalty rate he suggested (5 percent on the first 3,500 copies rising to 12½ percent on sales over 10,000 copies). McKeon eventually agreed to an arrangement that limited his earnings to \\$1,250 (McKeon to Commins, ibid.). \n\nWhen Cerf invited him to compile a shorter collection of Aristotle’s writings for the ML, McKeon insisted on a contract before beginning work. He wrote Cerf, “If you had asked me to do the small Aristotle before the months of battling with Saxe [Commins] about the larger Aristotle, I should probably have told you it couldn’t be done. After that experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me, therefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the only thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would seem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more concretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you propose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold annual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945). The terms of the contract have not been ascertained, but McKeon described the royalty he received on sales of *Introduction to Aristotle* as “meager” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). \n\n*Introduction to Aristotle* established itself as a textbook and became one of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period from November 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,114 copies, making it the ML’s third best-selling title and one of eight titles (including Giants) with annual sales exceeding 10,000 copies. \n\nWhen the ML edition was declared out of print McKeon sought a reversion of rights so that *Introduction to Aristotle* could be published by the University of Chicago Press. Random House agreed to his request, overlooking the fact that the collection was still in print in the paperbound series Modern Library College Editions. Klopfer admitted, “Nobody thought of the Modern Library College Edition until we had committed ourselves. . . . There wouldn’t have been a chance of reverting any rights to you if we hadn’t overlooked the MLCE” (Klopfer to Morris Philipson, University of Chicago Press, 2 October 1972). The reversion was limited to hardcover rights. \n\nThe University of Chicago Press published its edition of *Introduction to Aristotle* in 1973. Described as a “second edition, revised and enlarged,” it included a new general introduction and new introductions to each work. In addition to the contents of the ML edition, it included *De Partibus Animalium* (On the Parts of Animals), Book I, Chapter 1, and *Rhetorica* (Rhetoric), Book I, Chapters 1–4 and Book II, Chapters 18–22. The format was 3/16 inch taller than the 7½ inch format the ML was then using. The volume was perfect bound rather than sewn, and it was bound in thin paper-covered boards—technically a hardcover under the terms of the contract, but for practical purposes as close as possible to a paperback. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nAristotle, *Politics* (1943– ) 362 \nAristotle, *Rhetoric; Poetics* (1954– ) 469 \n\n",

Brilliantly realistic in its picture of moral and physical decay among the impoverished sharecroppers and tenant farmers of the South, this novel has been universally acclaimed for its high literary merit and for its socially significant viewpoint. Throughout the book there runs a skillfully drawn thread of rich humor, imparting to the reader a sympathetic understanding of the shocking state in which many Americans still live. \n> Erskine Caldwell has long been regarded as one of our foremost writers, and most readers would give *Tobacco Road* a prominent place in the list of his writings. (*Spring 1957*) \n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1932; rights subsequently transferred to Duell, Sloan and Pearce. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–241) printed from Scribner/Duell, Sloan and Pearce plates except for “After Ten Years” (pp. [*7–9*]) which was not in Scribner printings. Publication announced for February 1947. *WR* 17 May 1947. First printing: Not established. Discontinued 1969/70. \n\nThe reprint agreement for the ML edition was signed in May 1945 with publication scheduled for spring 1947 (Cerf to Charles Duell, 20 September 1946). The contract for the ML edition of Howard Fast’s *The Unvanquished* (379), which appeared in fall 1945, was signed at the same time. Details are not available about the advance paid by the ML or the initial royalty rate; in the 1960s the ML was paying royalties of 15 cents a copy. \n\nCaldwell’s preface “After Ten Years” originally appeared in the 1940 edition published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce with black-and-white illustrations by David Fredenthal. \n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted that the retail price of ML books had increased since 1947 and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12 cents a copy. \n\n#### 397b.

One of the first of the realistic novels of the Depression, it was among the most controversial. Profoundly influential in its time—both artistically and socially—*Tobacco Road* remains a landmark of American literature. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nCaldwell, Erskine, *God’s Little Acre* (1934–1969) 268 \n\n",

Readers of the Modern Library series have clamored for the inclusion of their favorites from the pen of England’s great story-teller, and the most insistent demand has been for *The Eustace Diamonds*.

The first two (*Arrowsmith* No. 42 and *Babbitt* No. 162) have maintained, year after year, a commanding place among the most popular books on the list. Now *Dodsworth*, Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape from the tensions of industrialism and in revolt against European patronage of America, is given permanence among the best of the world’s best books. Clifton Fadiman contributes a sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his Foreword. (*Fall 1947*) \n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br> Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape from the tensions of his own industrial empire and in revolt against the patronizing attitudes of Europeans toward Americans is one of his most enduring novels. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930 is nowhere so critical of his own countrymen and nowhere so proud of their genuine attainments. In this respect *Dodsworth* is a novel of protest and yet of irony; it represents Sinclair Lewis at his best as an observer and as a satirist. Clifton Fadiman contributes a perceptive and sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his Foreword. (*Spring 1962*) \n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. 1–377) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1947. *WR* 10 January 1948. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nAfter following his editor, Harry Maule, from Doubleday to Random House, Lewis expressed the hope that *Dodsworth* could be added to the ML alongside *Arrowsmith* (254) and *Babbitt* (348). The ML tried to secure reprint rights in 1941, but negotiations with Harcourt, Brace were unsuccessful. Lewis then suggested *Elmer* *Gantry*, which apparently would have been available, but Cerf thought that any of his major works would be preferable (Lewis to Maule, 26 June 1941; Maule memo to Cerf, 27 June 1941; Maule to Lewis, 8 July 1941). Five years later Cerf approached Harcourt, Brace again, pointing out that Lewis was anxious to have *Dodsworth* in the series (Cerf to Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, 6 September 1946). This time he was successful, and the ML secured U.S. and Canadian reprint rights. \n\n#### 400b.

These earlier novels exposed a narrow, provincial, materialist America—and cries of outrage did not prevent Lewis’ Zenith, his Babbitts and Gantrys, from becoming part of the American language and consciousness. \n> In *Dodsworth* he explores possibilities for regeneration and growth. Samuel Dodsworth, perhaps the most sympathetic character to emerge from Zenith, makes, with his wife, the time-honored pilgrimage to Europe—and what was intended as a vacation becomes a forced examination of a life too narrowly lived, of a marriage too fragile to sustain the pressures and temptations of a year’s leisure. Dodsworth’s honesty and his courage throughout his ordeal allow him to survive and to grow—and in this last of Lewis’ pre-Depression novels, satire is balanced by a cautious optimism. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nSinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933– ) 254 \nSinclair Lewis, *Babbitt* (1942– ) 348 \nSinclair Lewis, *Cass Timberlane* (1957– ) 499 \n\n",

Signed: Riki. \n\n> Front flap:<br> It is a source of great pride to the editors of the Modern Library whenever a book universally recognized as a classic is added to the series. Such a volume, hailed for almost twenty-five centuries as a “universal history” by “the most Homeric of historians,” is Herodotus’ account of the struggle between Greece and Persia. Offered complete and unabridged in over 700 pages in the famous George Rawlinson translation, the work of the “Father of History” is available for the first time at a price within the means of every reader. Francis R. B. Godolphin, Dean of the College, Princeton University, provides an illuminating introduction. (*Fall 1947*) \n\nRawlinson translation originally published in London, 1858–60. Published by Random House as part of *The Greek Historians: The Complete and Unabridged Historical Works of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Arian*, edited with an introduction, revisions, and additional notes by Francis R. B. Godolphin (2 vols., 1942). The ML text was taken from *The Greek Historians* but was printed from plates made from a new typesetting because of the ML’s smaller format. Goldolphin’s introduction to the ML edition consists of the first thirteen pages of his introduction to *The Greek Historians*; the glossary and index to Herodotus in the larger work are omitted. Published fall 1947. *WR* 10 January 1948. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nGodolphin notes, “In the translation of Herodotus a number of passages omitted by Rawlinson have been restored to the text, and the artificiality of diction in the speeches has been removed in favor of the direct and simple use of the second person” (*The Greek Historians* I, p. v). Ten years after the ML edition was published Linscott suggested the addition of a frontispiece map with the place names Herodotus used in italics and their modern equivalents in roman type. He thought that modern readers couldn’t follow the narrative without such a map (Linscott to Cerf, 15 September 1957). The map does not appear to have been added. \n\n*The Persian Wars* sold 5,578 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first quarter of ML sales. Sales totaled 53,341 copies by spring 1958. \n\n",

Statement on front: “Five days out of a man’s life—one of the strangest, most remarkable narratives ever written.” \n\n> Front flap:<br> A merciless and absorbing story, *The Lost Weekend* has become for the victim of alcoholism what De Quincey’s *The Confessions of an English Opium Eater* has been for the drug addict. It is a psychological study which moves with relentless speed and heartbreaking truth to its inevitable end. As drama it is tense, as a case history it is painfully accurate, as a search into the depths of the alcoholic’s mind it is terrifying. Yet as a novel it has a sobriety of purpose and a steadiness of skill attained by few writers of our time. (*Spring 1948*) \n\nOriginally published by Farrar & Rinehart, 1944. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–244) printed from Rinehart plates; to accommodate the plates the ML edition was 3/16 inch taller and ⅛ inch wider than the ML’s standard format. Published spring 1948. *WR* 29 May 1948. First (and only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950. \n\nCerf expressed interest in a ML edition of *The Lost Weekend* in 1945, but the original edition was still selling well and Farrar & Rinehart ruled out any reprint edition until after Billy Wilder’s forthcoming motion picture version starring Ray Milland and Jane Wyman had run its course. After the ML’s offer had been rejected Jackson wrote Cerf: \n\n> I hope you will understand . . . how disappointed I am, because it seems to me that being chosen by the Modern Library is the nearest American equivalent to “immortality,” if I may use such a fancy word. If THE LOST WEEKEND should be able to hold your interest a few years from now, I hope you will “tap” me then for your society. Nothing could make me prouder or happier, as I believe you know already (Jackson to Cerf, 17 July 1945). \n\nCerf replied that he hoped the ML edition could be published in late 1946 or early 1947 (Cerf to Jackson, 20 July 1945). In 1946 he announced that *The Lost Weekend* was “ticketed for a permanent place in the Modern Library, but the date is still highly uncertain” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 2 February 1946, p. 18). \n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *The Lost Weekend* was dropped from the series after two and a half years, making it one of the ML’s shortest-lived title<s>s</s>. The only title that had a shorter tenure was Irving Fineman’s *Hear, Ye Sons* (1939), which lasted in the series for twenty-six months. \n\n",

Designed to meet the needs of students and general readers alike, this book offers St. Thomas’s teachings on God, Creation, Man, Law, Grace, Habit, Virtue and kindred subjects, derived from the *Summa Theologica* and the *Summa Contra Gentiles*. The selections and the illuminating Introduction are by Anton C. Pegis, President of The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. (*Spring 1948; [Spring 1956]*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A on coated white paper with strong orange yellow (68) instead of medium gray and vivid yellowish green (129) instead of strong red. (*Fall 1963*) \n\nOriginal ML collection derived from *Basic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas*, edited by Anton C. Pegis (2 vols., Random House, 1945). Published spring 1948. *WR* 5 June 1948. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. \n\nPegis states in the Preface: “The present volume represents selections of materials, drawn entirely from *Basic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas*, which Random House published in 1945. . . . I have not made my selections with an eye to the opinions of specialists; I have aimed at meeting what seemed to me the needs of the college student who is a beginner in St. Thomas. Such a student will find in this book St. Thomas’ mature views of the most crucial questions of natural theology, psychology, theory of knowledge and ethics” (p. vii). \n\n*Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas* was widely adopted in Catholic colleges as a textbook for philosophy courses, and it became one of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,129 copies, making it the second best-selling title in the series and one of five ML titles with annual sales exceeding 10,000 copies. Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199) outsold Aquinas by 434 copies; *Introduction to Aristotle* (396) trailed Aquinas by fifteen copies. Pegis later indicated that *Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas* consistently sold 15,000–18,000 copies a year and had become “unexpectedly a textbook. . . . No one planned it this way, and certainly no one anticipated such an unusual eventuality. But, what is worse, the *Introduction* is an improperly organized textbook since it was never edited with such a teaching purpose in view; it was simply organized as a representative collection of Thomistic readings from *Basic Writings*. As a textbook, the *Introduction* needs a wider range of selections, introductions in the fields of instruction involved, notes, bibliographies and both subject and author indices” (Pegis to Klopfer, 21 June 1963). \n\nPegis suggested a revised edition prepared specifically for the textbook market as early as 1951. Part of his concern seems to have been to secure better financial terms for himself, but no one at Random House wanted to take such a successful title out of the ML (Klopfer to Pegis, 5 December 1951). Pegis was still talking about a textbook edition in 1963. At that time he noted that the market would be expanding sharply as the baby boom generation entered Catholic colleges and proposed turning *Introduction to Aquinas* into a textbook selling at five or six dollars with a normal royalty of 10 to 15 percent of the list price. He also offered to prepare a shorter and more general volume titled *The Aquinas Papers* to replace *Introduction to Aquinas* in the ML (Pegis to Klopfer, 21 June 1963). \n\nEpstein saw no point in scrapping the ML’s plates for *Introduction to Aquinas* (Epstein memo to Klopfer, 14 August 1963). Pegis then suggested raising the list price from \\$1.95 to \\$2.45 and increasing his royalty to 10 percent (Pegis to Klopfer, 27 August 1963). Epstein countered with an offer of a 5 percent royalty based on a list price of \\$2.45—the retail price of ML books was in the process of increasing to \\$2.45 in any case—and Pegis accepted (Pegis to Klopfer, 10 October 1963). \n\n",

Unfortunately the novel is often confused with its popular dramatization, which toured the United States for some years, reaching many people who had never read the book, and which relied on a kind of melodrama and simplification of character totally alien to the original. Thus “Uncle Tom” has become a term of opprobrium for a subservient black, whereas Uncle Tom in the novel is a man who, under the most inhumane of circumstances, never loses his human dignity. \n> Published in 1852, the book sold over 300,000 copies in a year—a number unprecedented at that time—and was credited by Lincoln himself with helping to bring about the Civil War. Interestingly enough, although it first appeared in an abolitionist paper, *The National Era*, it was not intended as either propaganda or an attack on the South. Indeed, it presented some of the favorable aspects of slavery while crystallizing the sentiments of the abolitionist North. It is notable, for example, that the cruel slave owner, Simon Legree, is a New Englander, while the kindly, good-tempered St. Clare is a Kentuckyan. \n\nPublished November 1985 at \\$11.95.

Now, through the co-operation of her original publishers, we are able to offer the passionate and mystical verses of one of the most original and appealing poets in the entire history of American letters. The romantic circumstances under which Emily Dickinson became a hermit and guarded her poems against publication during her lifetime are now a legend; her poems themselves are the real and lasting expression of her incomparable intensity and delicacy. (*Fall 1948*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1948. *WR* 23 October 1948. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nCerf first expressed interest in a ML edition of Dickinson’s poetry in 1937, offering Little, Brown a \\$1,500 advance against royalties. At that time all of Dickinson’s poems were protected by copyright, and Little, Brown rejected the offer. Alfred R. McIntyre, the firm’s president, wrote: “You have made a good offer, but it does not change our views. This is a very valuable property and we are afraid that, though our sales might not fall off tremendously, they would fall off enough so that we should not gain by the transaction.” He noted that Little, Brown’s share of the advance would be \\$750 (the other half would go to the Dickinson estate) and that if it took five years for sales of the ML edition to cover the advance, Little, Brown’s income would only be \\$150 a year—and that a very small decline in sales would erase the firm’s profit (McIntyre to Cerf, 26 May 1937). \n\nBy 1948, when the ML was able to negotiate reprint rights, Little, Brown’s situation had changed but the ML was still unable to get everything it wanted. *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson*, published in the ML in October 1948, consisted of Dickinson’s *Poems* (1890), *Poems: Second Series* (1891), and a selection from *Poems: Third Series* (1896). The three books, originally published by Roberts Brothers, had been published by Little, Brown & Co. since 1898, when it absorbed Roberts Brothers. \n\nThe first two volumes entered the public domain in 1946 and 1947, and the third would enter the public domain in 1952. The ML had hoped to base its edition on Dickinson’s *Poems: Centenary Edition* (Little, Brown, 1930), which included poems from two subsequent volumes. Little, Brown flatly refused to allow the ML to base its selection on the Centenary Edition. The ML wanted a more comprehensive collection than the poems already in the public domain since World Publishing Co. was bringing out a volume of Dickinson’s public domain poems in their Living Library series. Little, Brown finally gave the ML permission to include poems from the first three volumes provided not more than a third of the total came from *Poems: Third Series* (Linscott to Conrad Aiken, 31 March 1948 and 5 April 1948). This stipulation required the omission of twenty-one poems from *Poems: Third Series*. \n\nAiken had repeatedly urged the ML to reprint his *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924). When the arrangements with Little, Brown were made Linscott wrote him, “Since this looks like a very simple editorial job, Bennett has suggested that I make the selection. It seemed to me that we might be able to use the Introduction you did for the English edition (or perhaps a revised version) on payment of a comparatively small fee. The reason for this parsimony is that we have to pay a heavy royalty to Little Brown which leaves us little or no editorial margin” (Linscott to Aiken, 31 March 1948). \n\nAiken, who had clashed with the ML three years earlier over the removal of poems by Ezra Pound from *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68), which he edited with William Rose Benét, responded: \n\n> “What’s this, another Trojan Horse? another case of “dona ferentes”, as when Saxe [Commins] told me of the marvelously easy way I could make \\$250 without a stroke of work, all by just letting him use my comprehensive anthology with Bill Benet’s book to make a Giant—and little aiken [*sic*] to get no royalty, while the Giant proceeded to blanket the sales of the Modern Library edition???? As I’ve written Bernice [Baumgarten, Aiken’s agent], for fifteen years or longer I’ve repeatedly been urging the use of my Selected ED in the Modern Library, and this little manoeouvre [*sic*] doesn’t, from where I’m sitting, look either pretty or generous—nor <u>very</u> much like the magnanimity one expects from an old friend (Aiken to Linscott, 2 April 1948; underlining in original). \n\nLinscott replied that little editing was involved since the ML wanted to use as many poems as possible and only a handful of poems had be omitted from the third volume (Linscott to Aiken, 5 April 1948). \n\nThere were significant differences between the ML volume and Aiken’s 1924 anthology. The ML edition presents 426 of Dickinson’s poems in four sequences (“Life,” “Nature,” “Love,” and “Time and Eternity”). Aiken’s anthology included 220 poems with each poem printed on a separate page. The ML numbered the poems within each sequence. Aiken had given them titles. \n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 6 cents a copy. Aiken was pacified with a payment of \\$1,000 for the use of his introduction to *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924), which he revised for the ML. The revisions included correcting his reference in the first paragraph to T. W. Higginson as “editor of the *Atlantic Monthly* at that time” (Cape edition, pp. 5–6) to “essayist and contributor to the *Atlantic Monthly*” (ML edition, p. vii–viii). \n\nSales through spring 1958 totaled 36,631 copies; annual sales for the three-year period May 1955–April 1958 showed steady growth as follows: 4,066 (1955–56), 5,141 (1956–57), and 5,246 (1957–58). Bonnell and Bonnell (p. 112) report a seventeenth printing of 7,000 copies in 1963 and seven printings “since then” totaling 25,500 copies. \n\n*Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* has remained one of the most readily available editions of Dickinson’s poetry for most of the period since its publication. It survived the 1970s, when Random House slashed hundreds of titles from the Modern Library, and remained in print into the 1980s. The contents, based on the copyright status of Dickinson’s poems in 1948, remained unchanged throughout this period. It was only in 1996, after Random House revived the Modern Library, that the twenty-one poems omitted from the original edition were added. By this time they had been in the public domain for forty-four years. The only other differences between the content of the original ML edition and the reset 1996 version were the replacement of Aiken’s introduction with an unsigned biographical note by Billy Collins and the welcome addition of an index of first lines. \n\n",

As satire, it deftly strikes its blows at the follies of two ages, and as a passionate expression for justice and freedom, it is a work which offers ever-new rewards for the reflective reader. The second volume by Mark Twain to be included in the series, *A Connecticut Yankee* takes an honored place beside its predecessor, the Modern Library Giant *Tom Sawyer* and *Huckleberry Finn* (G-49). (*Spring 1949*) \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Bros., 1889. ML edition (pp. [v]–450) printed from Harper plates. Published spring 1949. *WR* 16 April 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nCerf asked the director of sales and promotion at Harper’s if he thought *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court* would do well in the ML. He also wanted to know how many other reprint editions were on the market and whether Harper’s had plates in good condition that would fit the ML’s format (Cerf to William H. Rose, 20 September 1948). The reprint contract was dated 14 October 1948. The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 5 cents a copy. The royalties were essentially a plate rental since *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court* was in the public domain. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nTwain, Mark, *Adventures of Tom Sawyer & Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1940) G47 \nTwain, Mark, *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1985) 642 \n\n",

With this book that need is now fulfilled. It includes the widest possible variety of odes, satires, eclogues, elegies and epigrams that have come down the centuries from such poets as Catullus, Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, Seneca, Juvenal, Martial and others. The translations by many skilled hands are the best obtainable, and the Introduction by F. R. B. Godolphin brilliantly interprets the poets and the verse of antiquity. (*Spring 1949; [Spring 1959]*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published spring 1949. *WR* 29 January 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. \n\nGodolphin wanted to use Ezra Pound’s translations of seven elegies of Propertius, but New Directions indicated that the permission fee would be \\$250. Commins thought that the normal fee should be about \\$10 per translation and declared, “I’ll be damned if we’ll pay anything like it” (Commins to Godolphin, 18 November 1948). The Pound translations were not used. Sales totaled 20,098 copies by spring 1958. \n\nAn internal Random House memo indicated in 1968 that *The Latin Poets* could not be shifted to Vintage Books, the firm’s quality paperback series, because permissions for use of copyrighted translations in the anthology applied specifically to the ML edition. A decision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November 1968). \n\n",

To Catholic readers it goes to the heart of their faith and to more and more Protestants it has become the book by which sectarian differences can be resolved. By both it is acknowledged a literary masterpiece. Included in every list of great books for students and general readers, *The Confessions*, complete and unabridged in the E. B. Pusey translation and with a stirring Introduction by Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, now takes a proud and permanent place in the Modern Library series. (*Spring 1949*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1949. *WR* 25 June 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. \n\nThe Pusey translation, originally published in 1838, appears to have been recommended by Sheen. The ML’s spring 1949 catalog announced *The Confessions of Saint Augustine* in the J. G. Pilkington translation, but Commins asked Sheen to indicate which of the two translations he preferred (Commins to Sheen, 16 November 1948). Cerf believed that the imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked Sheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen did not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would affect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to contact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949). The Church approved the introduction but declined to give an imprimatur since Pusey was not a Catholic and his translation had not been submitted to the censor. \n\nSales totaled 59,736 copies by spring 1958. \n\n#### 416b.

Discontinued 1970/71. \n\n*Pale Horse, Pale Rider* was the first Harcourt, Brace title added to the ML after Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for nine of its titles, including Porter’s *Flowering Judas and Other Stories* (1940: 333) and works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf, so they could be included in its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics. Harcourt, Brace was reluctant at first to allow *Pale Horse, Pale Rider* into the ML and offered Porter’s *The Leaning Tower* instead. It then decided, perhaps as a peace offering, that the ML could have the earlier work (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to Cerf, 3 December 1948). \n\n*Flowering Judas and Other Stories* never appeared in Harbrace Modern Classics and was restored to the ML in 1953. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nPorter, *Flowering Judas and Other Stories* (1940) 333 \n\n",

Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. \n\nMontaigne’s *Essays* had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first in the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation, and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947). He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged. The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United States. Because there was some question of British rights, we voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29 September 1947). \n\nBates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century translation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the public domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the original and to give the best possible modern rendering.” \n\nBates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt translation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the Editor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised it, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to the accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to modernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the translation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]). Bates did not consider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement “completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of the title page be omitted. \n\nThe manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have been delivered until the following spring. Bates received \\$500 for his editorial work plus \\$144 to cover half of the typing costs. \n\nBates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included the essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion of sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain in language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one of the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and quotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed. If you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to Commins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in fact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or, if included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948). \n\n#### 419b.

(*Fall 1960*) \n\nIn 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern Library College Edition, for which he received \\$50. He also submitted a list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s. \n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s translation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal, Letters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3 November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion. If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s *Complete Essays* in 1958, may not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nMontaigne, *Essays*, Florio translation (1933–1945) G10.1 \nMontaigne, *Essays*, Trechmann translation (1946–1948) G10.2 \n\n",

The young have turned to it, generation after generation, for the fullest expression of the romantic mood and gesture. This at once romantic and irreverent tale is cherished by people of all ages for its excitement as story, for its passion, its lyric felicity, its impudent satire and its lively wit. *Don Juan*, the first of Byron’s works to be included in the Modern Library series, is introduced, brilliantly and perceptively, by Louis Kronenberger.

A sixteen-canto epic satire in ottava rima, it recounts the seductions and betrayals, mishaps and adventures of the rakish Spanish grandee. Byron’s “plan was to have no plan” but to “unpack his heart” in the person of his hero. By his own account he meant to be “quietly facetious about everything,” and he used the epic to satirize English life, customs, manners and morals. But beneath the satiric impulse was a hatred of hypocrisy and a consciousness of the power of illusion. If *Childe Harold*, as Louis Kronenberger remarks in his introduction, “is in large part Byronism, *Don Juan* “is Byron.” Romantic, irreverent, exuberant and entertaining, it is a “hymn to the earth,” but also a human sequence to “its own music chaunted.” \n> “There is something for us to learn from the courage and buoyancy with which Byron came to terms with a world as shabby and confused as ours.” —Dame Helen Gardner \n\nPublished fall 1984 at \\$8.95.

Francis Hackett’s chronicle of his erratic life and many loves is a historical pageant of stirring events and colorful personalities. It is generally acknowledged to be one of the most vivid biographies of modern times. (*Spring 1959*) \n\nOriginally published as *Henry the Eighth* by Horace Liveright, 1929.

Discontinued 1969/70. \n\nThe ML paid Liveright a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. The Liveright plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML had to reset the text and make new plates. The ML’s typesetting was made from a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he indicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March 1949). The \\$2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates became the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against royalties. In effect the ML paid a \\$3,000 advance. Liveright contributed nothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties were due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition passed 30,000 copies. Hackett received \\$750 from Liveright when the ML edition was published and nothing thereafter. \n\nArthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930 lived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American publishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of his own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the \\$2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that the ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random House he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in December 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies, leaving unearned royalties of \\$1,433.20. The ML had paid nothing to Liveright since the initial advance in 1949 (Hiram Haydn to Hackett, 22 December 1958). \n\n",

Here, a series of lucid translations enables the reader to appreciate Kant’s towering importance as an ethical and social thinker and to understand his enduring influence on the shape of philosophy. The twelve essays in this volume have been carefully arranged by Professor Carl J. Friedrich to represent the range of Kant’s most essential writings. \n> Professor Friedrich has contributed an original essay for this volume in the form of a brilliant interpretive Introduction which places Kant, the philosopher and the man, in his time and timelessness. \n> A note about Kant’s special relevance today: “Indeed, the problem of freedom, the freedom of the human personality to unfold and fulfill its higher destiny, is the central issue of all of Kant’s philosophizing” —from the Introduction. (*Spring 1967 format*) \n\nML original collection. Published December 1949. *WR* 21 January 1950. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nFriedrich received a \\$750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy. At first he planned to include selections from *Critique of Pure Reason* but wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly as I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very unsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure Reason.” He suggested omitting *Critique of Pure Reason* altogether and including fuller extracts from the *Prolegomena* (Friedrich to Commins, 14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page selection from the Introduction to *Critique of Pure Reason* was included. The ML published an abridged edition of *Critique of Pure Reason* in 1958 (506). \n\nFriedrich wrote Commins that he thought that *The Philosophy of Kant* was a misleading title since large parts of the *Critique* were not included. He suggested calling the book *Introduction to Kant* or *Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy* (Friedrich to Commins, 20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had already been announced. He argued that *The Philosophy of Kant* did not misrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but he offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to Friedrich, 25 July 1949). \n\nWhen he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest editor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12 October 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library). \n\nSales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950. \n\n#### 422b.

At first hand Parkman gathered from Sioux Indians, hunters and trappers the material which was to make *The Oregon Trail* as much a tale of adventure as an authentic chronicle of the frontier. Exactly a century after its first publication, it takes its place in the Modern Library series, introduced by a distinguished contemporary historian, Henry Steele Commager. (*Fall 1949*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for fall 1949. *WR* 11 February 1950. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. \n\n*The Oregon Trail* was originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received \\$2,000 for the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page drawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of the chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were to be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21 January 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both *The Oregon Trail* and Alcott’s *Little Women*, the other Illustrated Modern Library title announced for fall 1947. \n\nAt this point the type for *The Oregon Trail* was in galleys and the plates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *The Oregon Trail* without illustrations in the regular ML. *Little Women* (431) was added to the regular series the following year. \n\nThe jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss made for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received \\$100 for the introduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote him about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume was at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29 June 1949). \n\n",

The cast: Edgar Allan Poe, A. Conan Doyle, G. K. Chesterton, R. Austin Freeman, Jacques Futrelle, Melville Davisson Post, E. C. Bentley, Agatha Christie, H. C. Bailey, Ellery Queen, Dorothy L. Sayers, Rex Stout, Carter Dickson and Cornell Woolrich. These names offer a clue to the quality of the stories, many of which appear in an anthology for the first time. (*Fall 1949*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed. Vincent Starrett (1928). Published December 1949. *WR* 14 January 1950. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nStarrett declined the ML’s invitation to revise *Fourteen Great Detective Stories* (1928: 155), citing lack of time, the “wildly inadequate” fee offered, and his lack of sympathy with the hard-boiled genre which he thought should be represented (Starrett to Maule, 28 July 1946). The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond Chandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo to Cerf, 23 September 1946). \n\nHaycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight. In his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in detective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the growth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely imitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection was available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has excelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that the hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and distinct form” (p. xii). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed.

Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through them inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche has opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the world of dreams, Sigmund Freud has created a transformation in our generation’s thinking. *The Interpretation of Dreams* is here offered, complete and unabridged, in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who for almost forty years had been the translator and standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America. (*Spring 1950*) \n\nBrill translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1913. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1950. *WR* 25 March 1950.

The Giant includes the following Editor’s Note: \n\n> As the first chapter of this work is nothing but an introduction to the book proper, it was deemed best for the purposes of this collection of Freud’s basic writings to omit most of it and to give only those parts that are in any way pertinent to the themes under later consideration. For it is of no particular interest or value to the general reader to know everything held by the ancients and moderns concerning the phenomena of dreams, up to the appearance of the first German edition of this work in 1900. (p. 185) \n\nThe Editor’s Note is followed by three paragraphs headed, “*The author summarizes these views as follows.*” The regular ML edition omits both the Editor’s Note and this heading. The three summary paragraphs of the regular ML edition begin in the middle of p. 5 with no indication that anything has been omitted. In most editions of *The Interpretation of Dreams* the first chapter occupies about 95 pages. In the regular ML text it occupies five pages. \n\n#### 425b.

It bears testimony to the continuing vitality of one of the greatest of England’s imaginative, romantic poets. In its more than 700 pages are to be found all that the modern reader can demand. Here included are the “Descriptive Sketches,” “Lyrical Ballads,” tales, sonnets, odes, pastorals, “The Prelude,” “Ecclesiastical Sonnets” and a wide selection of long and short miscellaneous verse. Mark Van Doren, poet, essayist and teacher, has made a generous yet discriminating selection from the vast body of writing achieved by Wordsworth during the almost fifty years he devoted to poetry. Mr. Van Doren’s Introduction is an illuminating critical interpretation of the poet and his work. (*Spring 1950*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published spring 1950. *WR* 15 April 1950.

He offered Van Doren an additional \\$50 to prepare a bibliography, which was a standard feature of the College Editions (Stein to Van Doren, 23 February 1950).

In its original form, it was the novel by which Henry James won world-wide recognition in his early maturity.

Finally, as a motion picture, under its new title, the novel once again gave evidence of its vitality and popularity to a new mass audience. Now *Washington Square* takes an honored place in the Modern Library with three other famous works by Henry James: *The Turn of the Screw*, No. 169, *The Wings of the Dove*, No. 244, and *The Portrait of a Lady*, No. 107.

He says: “I am willing enough to agree with common opinion that *Of Human Bondage* is my best work. It is the kind of book that an author can only write once. After all, he has only one life. But the book I like best is *Cakes and Ale*.” The same distinction has been made by countless enthusiastic readers. They consider *Of Human Bondage* Maugham’s masterpiece. But the novel they take to their hearts for its candor and warmth and humor is *Cakes and Ale*. \n> The third Maugham novel in the Modern Library (*Of Human Bondage*, No. 176, and *The Moon and Sixpence*, No. 27, are the other two), is introduced into the series with the author’s own version of the controversies and conjectures aroused by this withering but affectionate satire.

For its vitality, its scope, its imagination and, above all, its compassion, it is more than a novelist’s achievement; it is an experience in which the reader becomes a deeply involved participant. (*Fall 1950*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except in brilliant yellow (83) and black only. Yellowish gray shading omitted from title, “By” in black instead of yellowish gray, “INTRODUCTION BY” in reverse instead of yellowish gray; other lettering on black panel as jacket A. \n\n> Front flap reset with the following revisions in the second sentence: “fifteen” omitted, “finest” changed to “most distinguished”. (*Fall 1955; Fall 1962*) \n\nOriginally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1932. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950. *WR* 30 September 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies. \n\nRandom House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith and Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML was *Sanctuary* (233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of Faulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles were added until 1946, when *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new typesetting. The publication of that volume, together with *The Portable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few months earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a major American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. The Modern Library edition of *Light in August*, published four years after *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*, became the third Faulkner volume in the series. \n\nThe ML reset *Light in August* because Smith and Haas had not made plates. All four Smith and Haas printings had been from standing type which had since been melted. The only previous reprint edition of *Light in August*, published by New Directions in its Modern Readers series in 1947, was photographically reproduced from the Smith and Haas edition and printed by offset lithography. \n\nIn addition to the first printing of 7,500 copies, printings of 429.1a were as follows: 5,000 copies (1951), 5,000 copies (1952), 5,000 copies (1953), 5,000 copies (1954), two printings of 5,000 copies each (1955), 5,000 copies (1956), three printings of 5,000 copies each (1957), four printings of 5,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 10,000 copies (1959), 10,000 copies (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the period 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so. \n\n#### 429.1b.

Unquestionably one of his masterworks, it has always stood near or at the top of any critic’s attempted listing of the author’s works in the order of their excellence or importance; and it will continue to be one of the most widely read, studied, and written about novels of this century. (*Spring 1963*) \n\nThe memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from ML printings of *Sanctuary* and *Absalom, Absalom!* was dated 14 November 1962 (RHC box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s *Light in August* was also dropped around this time. Introductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, including *Light in August*, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—*Selected Short Stories*, *Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and *Pylon* —were new to the ML. Two, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, had previously been combined in a single ML volume. \n\n#### 429.2.

His analysis of sentiment, his rich imaginative power, his insight into character, particularly feminine character, and his infinitely patient observation of the behavior and relationships of the people in his created world—these are the elements for which he is regarded as the *first* of our novelists. The overwhelming length of his masterpiece, *Clarissa*—over 2,000 pages in its unabridged form—has frightened away all too many readers. Under the skillful and perceptive editorship of John Angus Burrell of Columbia University, the substance and spirit of this great novel are retained and its prolixities and excesses are trimmed away to make a volume of over 800 lively pages. (*Fall 1950*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita pictorial jacket on coated white paper with inset illustration in vivid purplish red (254) and black of a woman wearing a bonnet tied below her chin, with “Modern Library Book” in reverse and Fujita “ml” symbol in black at foot of illustration; “Clarissa” in deep purplish red (256) and other lettering in black above inset illustration. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1967 format*) \n\nOriginal ML abridgment. Published fall 1950. *WR* 9 December 1950. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nBurrell received a flat fee of \\$1,000 for his editorial work and introduction. Cerf asked for a book of no more than 600 pages with the manuscript to be delivered by 1 February 1950. He told Burrell: “This provision of size should mean that our condensation will be somewhat longer—and I know it will be better—than any other condensation now in existence” (Cerf to Burrell, 4 November 1949). The published volume exceeded the anticipated length by 200 pages. \n\nRandom House announced the forthcoming ML edition as *Clarissa Harlowe*. Burrell wrote to emphasize that the correct title was *Clarissa, or, The History of a Young Lady* (Burrell to Cerf and Commins, 23 February 1950). Commins wanted to use *Clarissa Harlowe* on the jacket. He argued that *Clarissa* was not enough to identify the book, that the full title was too long, and that everyone knew it by the incorrect title (Commins, undated memo to Klopfer). In the end the full title *Clarissa or The History of a Young Lady* was used on the title page but the running heads record the title as THE HISTORY OF [verso pages] CLARISSA HARLOW [recto pages]. The front panel of jacket A reads *Clarissa* | THE HISTORY OF | CLARISSA HARLOWE, THE FIRST AND | ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS | HEROINES OF THE ENGLISH NOVEL. \n\nThe front panel of jacket B records the title as Clarissa | or The History of a Young Lady. \n\n",

Illustration unsigned but probably by Albert de Mee Jousset. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Louisa May Alcott’s hope that *Little Women* would become “the most tattered, dog-eared, best-loved book in the library” has been more than fulfilled through the decades following its publication in 1868. Generation after generation, young people and their elders have read and reread the adventures of the March family, admired Jo’s daring, wept when Beth died and sighed sympathetically over Meg’s and Amy’s romantic adventures. Those who remember their youth and want to renew it keep a special place in their hearts for this nostalgic tale of a vanished time and spirit in American life. (*Fall 1950*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950. *WR* 30 September 1950. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1955. \n\n*Little Women* with illustrations by Albert de Mee Jousset was originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Jousset received \\$2,000 for the artwork, which included color illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings ranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on pages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both *Little Women* and Parkman’s *Oregon Trail*, the other Illustrated Modern Library title announced for fall 1947. \n\nAt this point the type for *Little Women* was in galleys (the text was set from the edition published in Grosset & Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior Library), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed, and all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *Little Women* in the regular ML without color illustrations. *The Oregon Trail* (423) was also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket of *Little Women* is unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color illustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library. \n\nThe ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second printing in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued. \n\n",

Out of it came one of the most influential religious autobiographies of Western literature, the *Apologia Pro Vita Sua*. It is far more than a vigorous defense of religious adherence; it is an affirmation of faith and conviction, a projection of a magnetic and powerful personality and a dynamic account of spiritual conversion. Anton C. Pegis, the renowned Thomist scholar and distinguished Catholic philosopher, provides an illuminating and perceptive introduction for Cardinal Newman’s masterpiece. (*Fall 1950*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950. *WR* 9 December 1950. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nCerf initially asked Jacques Maritain, whom Commins had suggested as a long shot, to write an introduction to *Apologia Pro Vita Sua* (Cerf to Maritain, 16 September 1949). Maritain either declined or did not reply. Cerf then turned to Pegis, who had worked with Random House and the ML in the past. At Commins’s request Pegis secured a nihil obstat and imprimatur on his introduction. Commins sent Pegis a copy of the original 1864 edition to mark for composition purposes (Commins to Pegis, 10 April 1950). Pegis initially hoped to include Newman’s corrections from the 1865 edition but decided to use the original text accompanied by the correspondence with Charles Kingsley (pp. 373–90) and Kingsley’s pamphlet, *What, Then, Does Dr. Newman Mean?* (pp. 391–430). \n\n",

Since then there have been countless books which described and interpreted that teeming land, but none has supplanted Rudyard Kipling’s radiant picture, with its people of high and low caste, in the hearts of readers, old and young. As a tale of picaresque adventure, as a pageant and as a social document, *Kim* is a classic in its own field.

He asked again the following year (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. At that point he appears to have given up. The idea of including a book by Kipling resurfaced in 1949; a week later he decided it should be *Kim* (Cerf to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 9 November 1949 and 15 November 1949).

Originally published in 1936 and long out of print, this novel has commanded huge prices in the rare book market, but is now brought within the means of every book buyer. Considered by every critic one of the major novels among the nineteen volumes written by the recent Nobel Prize winner, *Absalom, Absalom!* stands with *Sanctuary* (Modern Library No. 61), *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (No. 187) and *Light in August* (No. 88) as a distinguished achievement in the literature of the South and of the entire world. (*Spring 1951*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1936, with folding map tipped in following p. 384. ML edition (pp. 7–[383]) printed from RH plates with fly title leaf (pp. [5–6]) omitted, blank page before Chronology omitted, page numerals (380–384) removed from Chronology and Genealogy, and map redrawn to fit the ML’s format. Published spring 1951. *WR* 21 April 1951. First printing: 10,000 copies. \n\n*Absalom, Absalom!* was out of print in 1950 and very difficult to find. Frances Steloff, proprietor of the Gotham Book Mart, wrote Cerf: \n\n> This is to serve notice that you will not have peace or rest until you promise to reprint *Absalom, Absalom*. We have been advertising for many months without receiving a single quotation. Now at last I get the enclosed [a quotation from a dealer offering a copy at \\$74.25]. \n> I called the guy up just to see if he was serious, and sure enough the 25¢ is for postage and insurance, he explains, rare books must be insured. The last copy we sold for \\$20.00 and I thought we were robbing the poor customer, but there is no other way to lay hands on this title. \n> We have a poor student in Germany who made great sacrifices to get \\$7.50 to us; about six months ago we thought we could supply one at that price. And so we keep on searching without success. It is as you must know the most important of all Faulkner titles, and Faulkner has been on the up and up for the last two years. \n> Will you take my word for it that it will be the best selling title in the Modern Library for a very long time. I had hoped to avoid annoying you and thought I would extract a promise from Saxe [Commins] but he passed the buck (Steloff to Cerf, [April 1950]; quoted in Morgan, “Frances Steloff and the Gotham Book Mart,” pp. 741–42). \n\nSubsequent printings of 434a were as follows: two printings of 5,000 copies each (1952), 5,000 copies (1954), 5,000 copies (1956), 5,000 copies (1957), 7,000 copies (1959), two printings of 7,000 copies each (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing (there are no records of printings in 1953, 1955, and 1958) but the total of 86,000 copies for the period 1951–62 is probably accurate within 15,000 copies or so. \n\n#### 434b.

The introduction to Faulkner’s *Light in August* was also dropped around this time. Introductions appear to have been dropped when ML Faulkner titles began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, including *Absalom! Absalom!*, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—*Selected Short Stories*, *Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and *Pylon*, were new to the ML. Two, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, had previously been combined in a single ML volume (1946: 394). \n\n#### 434c.

Now such essays as “On Moral Duties,” “On Old Age,” “Scipio’s Dream” and “On the Character of the Orator” and the orations “Against Catiline” and the “Second Philippic,” as well as a generous assortment of Letters, make a volume of immense value to the scholar and general reader alike.

His poetry, here offered in its entirety, includes a number of recently found verses hitherto unavailable in most collections. In addition, a generous representation of his letters in complete form throws light on the emotional life of the poet and the creative sources of his writing. Harold E. Briggs, Professor of English at the University of Southern California, contributes an illuminating introduction and provides an appendix of documents dealing with the damning of “Endymion” by the critics who were responsible for the crucial series of events at the end of Keats’s life. (*Spring 1951*) \n\nOriginal ML collection, printed from offset plates. Published spring 1951. *WR* 9 June 1951. First ML printing: Not ascertained. \n\nPublished spring 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. Briggs received a flat fee of \\$250 to prepare a Keats collection for MLCE (Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1950). In June 1951 Stein indicated that a decision had been made to include the volume in the regular ML as well. “When the contract was originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition . . . we could not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve a part of our investment” (Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1951). Stein sent Briggs an additional payment of \\$100 in recognition of the publication of *The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Keats* in the regular ML. \n\nThe volume was printed from offset plates at a time when most ML titles were printed letterpress. Freiman was disappointed with the quality of the printing. When the first set of MLCE sheets arrived he told the ML’s printer that the quality was “very bad. I would not feel so sad about this were it not for the fact that these are printed from a new set of plates. Further, I have been impressed with the fine quality of printing the Rinehart editions enjoy” (Freiman to Richard Simon, Parkway Printing, 10 May 1951). MLCE had been created to compete with Rinehart Editions in the burgeoning college market. \n\nThe text of the poems “is substantially that of the first editions. A number of emendations have been made as a result of collating later editions. . . . Some silent changes in punctuation, etc., have been made in the interest of greater clarity. The text of Keats’s letters . . . is reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press from Maurice Buxton Forman’s *The Letters of John Keats*” (p. xxxv). \n\n",

The story of a man of fabulous daring somewhere on the South American seaboard during the turmoil of a revolution is far more than the recital of astounding feats; it is a drama of large-scale conflicts against a background of a strange land and the vast sea, told with power and insight and the subtle interplay of light and shadow. Robert Penn Warren, author of *All the King’s Men* and *World Enough and Time*, contributes an illuminating and perceptive introduction. (*Spring 1951*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Bros., 1904; subsequently published by Doubleday, Page & Co.; author’s “Note” added 1918. ML edition printed from Harper/Doubleday plates. Publication announced for spring 1951. *WR* 3 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1983. \n\nPublished 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. The ML paid Doubleday royalties of 8 cents a copy for the ML edition. Stein asked several professors about including *Nostromo* in MLCE and decided to go ahead despite the lukewarm response. Doubleday wanted it to be included in both the regular ML and MLCE because royalties for the MLCE edition were only 2 cents a copy. Doubleday indicated that two sets of plates were available, one of 631 pages in excellent shape and one of 537 pages in poor condition. Stein recommended that *Nostromo* be included in the regular ML and that the better plates be used (Stein memo to Haas, 15 August 1950). \n\nAfter *Nostromo* entered the public domain Klopfer inquired if a lower royalty would be appropriate. He was informed that Doubleday continued to receive full royalties on other editions and replied, “As long as everybody else is paying regular royalties certainly I don’t want to alter the terms. It’s just when a book actually gets kicked around in the public domain that we feel a change in arrangements should be made” (Klopfer to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 14 November 1963; Barbara Drysdale, Doubleday, to Klopfer, 6 December 1963; Klopfer to Drysdale, 12 December 1963). \n\n#### 438.2a.

Written in 1904, *Nostromo* is set in a small South American country. Against this tropical background Conrad has assembled an unusual assortment of men. Empire builder, rebel leader and outcast are all involved in conflicts of heroic proportions. The tragic values embodied in this novel make it apparent why Conrad thought of it as his most finely worked creation. \n\nBibliographical edition originally published by Doubleday, Page, 1923 or earlier.

From the materialist Charles Gould, owner of the Gould Concession of the San Tomé mine, and the traitorous Dr. Monygham, to old Georgio Viola and the sceptic Decoud, each character lives an illusion next to the “natural” man Nostromo and the beneficent Emilia Gould. A novel that reveals the nefarious effects of unbridled greed and imperialist interests, *Nostromo* upholds Conrad’s belief in fidelity, moral discipline, and the need for human communion. Conrad himself described it as “an intense creative effort on what I suppose will remain my largest canvas,” and it is considered one of his greatest works. It is an exemplary statement of his conviction that “the solidarity of all mankind” rests upon “simple ideas and sincere emotions.” \n> Written in 1904, the text reprinted here is based on the revised edition of 1925, including the Author’s Note and an introduction by Robert Penn Warren. \n\nPublished spring 1983 at \\$8.95.

Here is the rich heritage from the golden age of the drama. The tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes are timeless. Today, as it was twenty-five centuries ago, the insight of these dramatists into the spirit of man and his relationship to nature, to society and to his own soul is deeply rewarding and stirring. The seven plays in this volume are unmatched in all the literature of the drama for intensity and magnitude and boisterous humor.

Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted that *Four Famous Greek Plays* (178) would have to be completely revised. He told Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the Modern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart Edition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In addition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more specifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we prepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based upon the Lifetime Library [Random House] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK DRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give the College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted that *Seven Famous Greek Plays* would differ from the Rinehart anthology in the following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have Euripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally desirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I think for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do not.” \n\nStein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library edition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he indicated that the use of these translations would depend on the permission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit the ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions that prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the general introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein concluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book available for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of July 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1 February 1950). \n\nOates received a flat fee of \\$200 for his general introduction to Greek tragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a flat fee of \\$100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the introduction to *The Frogs*. Permission fees included \\$100 each for Aldington’s translation of *Alcestis* and Murray’s translation of *The Frogs*; More’s translation of *Prometheus Bound* appears to have required a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional \\$100 when *Seven Famous Greek Plays* was added to the regular ML (Commins to Oates, 28 June 1951). \n\n#### 439b.

Designed by Warren Chappell; unsigned. \n\n> Front flap as 94.1e: <br> For more than three-quarters of a century Walt Whitman has stood unique among the poets of the world. Publication of *Leaves of Grass* in 1855 marked the emergence upon the world scene of one of America’s most noteworthy personalities. His poetry, at once the most intensely personal in literature and of the most pervasive influence, has taken its place among the sublime utterances of man. Appropriately, the introduction to the Modern Library edition of the complete *Leaves of Grass* was written by Walt Whitman’s most distinguished American disciple, Carl Sandburg. (*Spring 1951; Spring 1953*) \n\n> *Jacket A* with front flap rewritten: <br> More than almost any other literary classic, Walt Whitman’s *Leaves of Grass* is not only a work of art but the capturing in print of the turbulence and tenderness of a poet’s personality. Whitman himself, conscious that *Leaves of Grass* was his own great monument, never ceased revising, polishing and adding to it, so that he could truly say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is no book, Who touches this book touches a man.” The present edition by Professor John Kouwenhoven of Barnard College reprints the excellent and authoritative “deathbed edition” of 1892, to which has been added the posthumously published “Old Age Echoes” and a generous selection of prose, including all of *Specimen Days*. (*Spring 1954*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in light olive (106), strong reddish brown (40) and black on coated white paper with right profile drawing of olive panel at left; lettering in strong reddish brown, light olive and black on wider white panel at right; “Walt Whitman” in black script across both panels. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A, rewritten text. (*Fall 1958*) \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding Whitman’s *Leaves of Grass* (94). Published spring 1951 in the regular ML. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. *Leaves of Grass* (94) was on the first list of titles scheduled for MLCE. Kouwenhoven indicated that the ML needed a thoroughly revised volume of Whitman’s writings when Stein invited him to write a new introduction for the College Edition. Stein agreed and offered him a flat fee of \\$250 to select and edit the text and write the introduction, noting that the new edition would assure the ML of “a book considerably more desirable than that offered by any competitors, not only in terms of quantity of material but in terms of the more complete picture it gives of Whitman himself” (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 25 January 1950; 5 April 1950; 10 April 1950). Stein sent Kouwenhoven an additional \\$100 when *Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose* was added to the regular ML (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 28 June 1951). \n\nThe 94.2 jacket with its outdated flap reference to Carl Sandburg’s introduction remained in use through 1953. The flap text was revised in spring 1954. ML catalogs began to list the title as *Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose* in spring 1954; ML lists inside the jackets and at the end of ML volumes continued to list it as *Leaves of Grass*. \n\nWhitman’s *Leaves of Grass* was one of four works that were published in the regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included in all three series were Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (1930: 197), Giant (1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (1929: 171), Giant (1937: G34), Illus ML (1943: IML 2); Fielding, *History of Tom Jones* (1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943: IML 5). \n\n#### 440b.

Published fall 1951. *WR* 29 December 1951. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\n*Six Modern American Plays* was originally intended for Modern Library College Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and added later to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee \\$150 for selecting the plays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950). Halline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline began by suggesting Anderson’s *Winterset*, Kaufman and Hart’s *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, O’Neill’s *Mourning Becomes Electra*, Robert Sherwood’s *There Shall Be No Night*, Philip Barry’s *Hotel Universe*, and Sidney Howard’s *Yellow Jack*. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who rejected *Hotel Universe* and *Yellow Jack* and indicated his preferred for O’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* and Sherwood’s *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*. \n\nStein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’s *Little Foxes*. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new dramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’s *Glass Menagerie* or *A Streetcar Named Desire*, Arthur Miller’s *Death of a Salesman*, or Heggen and Logan’s *Mister Roberts;* his own preference, he indicated, was Williams. Halline approved *The Emperor Jones*, *Abe Lincoln in Illinois* and *The Glass Menagerie* (Halline to Stein, 28 September 1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup: *The Emperor Jones*, *Winterset*, *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, *The Little Foxes*, *The Glass Menagerie*, and *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*. Sherwood’s play was dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission. *Death of a Salesman* was the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty than the ML was prepared to pay. *Mister Roberts* was finally selected, in part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid royalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay half a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition. \n\nIn the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the introduction only. \n\nStein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out the anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The costs of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College Edition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find some way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline, 25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951). *Six Modern American Plays* was added to MLCE in the mid-1960s. \n\nO’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* is reprinted in the version originally published by Boni and Liveright in 1921. For more information see O’Neill, *The Emperor Jones; The Straw* (1928: 157). \n\n#### 441b.

(*Fall 1951*) \n\n*Jacket* *A1:* Pictorial in pale green (149), dark reddish orange (38) and black on cream paper with drawing of formal dinner party ; title and author in black except “Silas Lapham” in reverse on pale green panel at top with, other lettering in black on dark reddish orange panel at foot. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The nationwide revival of interest in the works of America’s pioneer realistic novelist prompts the editors of the Modern Library to make William Dean Howells’ most celebrated book available to contemporary readers. Written in 1885, *The Rise of Silas Lapham* was then hailed as the first study of the native self-made businessman. It traced a new phenomenon in our national life during the years following the Civil War and portrayed the ferocity of the struggle for social recognition and acceptance. With the passage of more than a half century, this novel still reflects an era in America’s development and now offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on our national character. (*Fall 1951*) \n\n*Jacket A2:* As jacket A on coated white paper with upper panel in brilliant blue (177) and lower panel in strong yellow green (117). (*Early 1960s*) \n\nOriginally published by Ticknor & Co., 1885, and subsequently by Houghton, Mifflin. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1951. *WR* 10 November 1951. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. \n\nCerf first expressed interest in *The Rise of Silas Lapham* in 1937, when he asked if the ML could reprint it using the plates of Houghton, Mifflin’s Centenary Edition (Cerf to Robert Linscott, Houghton, Mifflin, 18 October 1937). Linscott replied that it could not be released to the ML because Houghton, Mifflin had just published a new edition printed from new plates. \n\nStein initially approached Alfred Kazin about writing the introduction, offering him \\$150 (Stein to Kazin, 26 June 1950). Kazin declined but expressed interest in *Charterhouse of Parma*; Stein indicated that if Stendhal’s novel were added to MLCE the introduction would be reserved for him (Stein to Kazin, 21 July 1950). He then asked Jacques Barzun, increasing the fee to \\$200. Barzun declined on the grounds that he was not equipped to do Howells justice (Stein to Barzun, 4 August 1950; Barzun to Stein, 9 August 1950). Stein succeeded on his third attempt. Clark received \\$200 for the introduction (Stein to Clark, 14 August 1950). \n\nThe official publication date as indicated in review copies was 25 September 1951. Sheets of the first printing were not received for binding until 4 October, so copies were probably not ready for distribution until later in October. \n\n#### 442b.

Rejecting the symbolism of Melville and Hawthorne, and the false sentimentality of popular novels, Howells defined realism as “nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material . . . fidelity to experience and probability of motive.” In this light, he examines the Laphams’ response to the ethical problems posed by economic expansion, their conflicts with an admired and resented Boston aristocracy, and, to give a balanced view of the Laphams’ world, delves into the fields of finance, architecture, and even the details of mineral paint production. This novel still reflects an era in America’s development and offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on our national character. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nHowells, *Hazard of New Fortunes* (1917–192?) 23 \n\n",

Now, thanks to the scholarly [-and perceptive] research of [+the late] Donald A. Stauffer, [+who was] Chairman of the English Department, Princeton University, [-who contributes a brilliant introduction,] the best of Coleridge’s poetry, essays and criticism are here collected and arranged for the delight of the student and general reader. Included in this book of 636 pages are such favorite poems as “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” “Kubla Khan,” many odes, sonnets and hymns, as well as essays on Shakespeare, on philosophy, morals and religion [+, and Stauffer’s brilliant and perceptive Introduction]. (*Fall 1951; [±Fall 1956]*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1951; initially published in MLCE. *WR* 17 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. \n\nOriginally published 1951 in MLCE and later that year in the regular ML. Stein initially approached Earl Leslie Griggs of New York University about editing the volume, but Griggs declined on the grounds that he had edited an edition of Coleridge for Ronald Press some years before (Stein to Griggs, 12 July 1950). He then offered Stauffer \\$250 to prepare the MLCE collection (Stein to Stauffer, 4 August 1950). \n\nCommins told Stauffer before the book was published, “When the contract was originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition of SELECTED POETRY AND PROSE OF COLERIDGE, we could not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer, 28 June 1951). Stauffer received an additional \\$100 when the regular ML edition appeared. \n\nThe poetry was set from *The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge*, ed. E. T. Coleridge (Clarendon Press, 1912). *Biographia Literaria*, included in its entirety, was set from the edition of J. Shawcross (Clarendon Press, 1907). Coleridge’s critical essays, “Romeo and Juliet” and “Hamlet, 1813,” were set from *Shakespearean Criticism*, ed. T. M. Raysor (Harvard University Press, 1930). The remaining prose was set from Coleridge’s *Complete Works*, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (7 vols., Harper & Bros., 1853). MLCE printings acknowledged the Clarendon Press; the acknowledgement did not appear in the regular ML edition, which concerned Stein (RH box 783). \n\n",

That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St. Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry and a generous selection of his prose. (*Spring 1952*) \n\nOriginal ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose*, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. *WR* 5 April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nThe ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from Nonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein to Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The ML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore more economical to print. \n\n*The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne* was originally scheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition was postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of \\$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an additional \\$100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML. Stein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows: \n\n> There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever before. (Stein to Coffin, 15 May 1951) \n\nA volume of Donne’s *Poetry and Prose*, ed. Frank J. Warnke, finally appeared in MLCE in 1967. \n\n#### 446b.

To his friend Ben Jonson he was “first poet in the world for some things,” but “for not keeping of accent deserved hanging.” Dr. Johnson and Dryden, each a cultural arbiter of his time, shared a low opinion of Donne’s work: according to Dryden, he “affects the metaphysics . . . in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softness of love.” \n> But in the first three decades of this century Donne was the poet, more than any other, to whom British and American poets turned for inspiration in language and sensibility.

With classic simplicity and a painter’s feeling for atmosphere and detail, Isak Dinesen (Baroness Karen Blixen) tells of the years she spent from 1914 to 1931 managing a coffee plantation in Kenya. Her adventures on safaris, expeditions to Nairobi, her roles as doctor to her neighbors and as hostess to strange guests, reveal a personality as sensitive to the primitive people and the animal life of the Ngong Hills as it was to the ideas that stirred the outside world. “When you have caught the rhythm of Africa,” she wrote, “you find that it is the same in all her music.” The natives, the mountains, the wildlife and trees, all were “different expressions of one idea, variations upon the same theme.” From the vast plains where the wild beasts roam to the snows of Kilimanjaro, from the foothills with the forest behind them to the dry-low country, the home of the giraffe and rhino, *Out of Africa* is a vibrant re-creation of the beauties of the African landscape and the ways of the land and its people. \n\nPublished fall 1983 at \\$8.95.

[iv]: \n\n> The text followed in this abridgement is that edited by George Birkbeck Hill, revised and enlarged by L. F. Powell, in six volumes, published by the Oxford University Press from 1934 to 1950. A few changes in punctuation have been made to meet the exigencies of abridgment. \n> The Powell-Hill *Johnson* is one of the monuments of scholarship, probably *the* great edition of any English classic. The reader who wishes to read the entire *Life of Johnson* is, of course, referred to this edition. We are grateful to the Oxford University Press for their gracious permission to use the Powell-Hill text in this abridgment. [*The Life of Samuel Johnson* comprises vols. 1–4 of the Powell-Hill edition; vols. 5–6 are Boswell’s *Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides* and Johnson’s *Diary of a Journey into North Wales*.] \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial on coated white paper with multi-color illustration of a London street scene with Samuel Johnson engaged in conversation at lower left; lettering in black with title and author on inset white panel at top. Signed: F. K. [Fritz Kredel]. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Few men in history have ever been known as intimately as Samuel Johnson. Famous in his own time for his wit and wisdom, he has had the rare good fortune to gain a posthumous extension of personality and influence over a period of more than one hundred and sixty years. James Boswell’s boast that Johnson would “be seen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived” has been borne out in the greatest biography in the English language. To give the modern reader the spirit and substance of Johnson’s life and times, Bergen Evans, Professor of English at Northwestern University, has winnowed out the obscurities and irrelevances of the full text and kept its essence. (*Fall 1952*) \n\nOriginal ML abridgment. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25 May 1952. *WR* 7 June 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Also published in MLCE. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. \n\nThe ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge Boswell’s *Life of Samuel Johnson*. Pottle indicated that he was badly behind schedule with Boswell’s *Journal* for McGraw-Hill and added, “I have no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’s *Life of Johnson*. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that to abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will buy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is that the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is, that they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of Boswell’s *Life of Johnson* will continue to be for textbook use in schools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the best offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text <u>with a good index</u>” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951; underlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition of *The Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2) which lacked an index. \n\nStein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was Bergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’s *Tristam Shandy* in MLCE (1950) and was the author of *The Natural History of Nonsense* (1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis Kronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein memo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in the project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on Johnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography, *Samuel Johnson* (Henry Holt, 1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have written and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29 June 1951). \n\nStein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words. “There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and there is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment of Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of \\$1,000 for the work (Stein to Evans, 10 July 1951). \n\nEvans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’s *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the first 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal number of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is notoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the errors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from Malone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from the definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized its use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to about half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The permission fee, paid by the ML, was \\$100. \n\nEvans told Stein in a long letter: \n\n> I’m <u>enthusiastic</u> about this project. I have cut the book down to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious significance and without having to make any changes whatever except, perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to tell you what had been omitted. \n> What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly unknown to the common reader. \n\nEvans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts, then hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing of her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no particular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her \\$100 to go through the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to cut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I let the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson canon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had cut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its interest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from over 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text again, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000, I believe, nothing <u>whatever</u> of any value or significance . . . was taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it with a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were irrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either the sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and sections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves uninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some unimportant person.” \n\nHe concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything like it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . <u>No</u> solid thought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly readable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it might have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951; underlining in original).” \n\nEvans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952. Proofreading was done at Random House. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (Giant, 1931) G2 \nJohnson, *Johnson’s Dictionary: A Modern Selection* (1965) 572 \nJohnson, *Johnson Reader* (1966) 580 \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n",

He solicited advice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos Baker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the Hampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George Stewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard Cooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated that *The Pathfinder* would be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper (Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favored *The Pathfinder*. The response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone a decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must admit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present seems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but I can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters I have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948). \n\nThree years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and asked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf what he thought of a Giant containing *The Deerslayer*, *The Pilot*, and *Satanstoe*, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite Cooper novel. In the end *The Pathfinder* was published in the regular ML. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nCooper, *Leatherstocking Saga* (Giant, 1966) G107 \n\n",

This anthology includes not only such striking examples of contemporary writing as Kafka’s “A Country Doctor” and Mann’s “Death in Venice,” but most of the classics from the grand tradition of the German short story in the nineteenth century. Two of the tales in this volume, Heinrich Mann’s “Three-Minute Novel” and Kleist’s “Earthquake in Chile,” in new translations by Professor Lange, are presented for the first time in a popular edition. (*Fall 1952*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Great German Short Novels and Stories*, ed. Bennett A. Cerf (256). Published December 1952. *WR* 10 January 1953. First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on 16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the entire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75. \n\nLange suggested a revision of the ML anthology *Great German Short Novels and Stories* after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s *Faust* which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930: 200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only collection of German narrative prose in English translation that the student is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely unsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to Stein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein to Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of contents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two exceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for economic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length of the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s *Immensee* instead of replacing it with the author’s *Carsten Curator* “because it has become a ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange that “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical sketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the stories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen selections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s original anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a different translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of \\$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid the cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for selections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death in Venice” (see 256). \n\n#### 452b.

Now, after long negotiations, fifteen of his best tales, selected and brilliantly introduced by Philip Rahv, editor of *The Partisan Review*, are made available to the ever-expanding circle of Kafka enthusiasts. The newly recognized master of obsessive fantasy, of symbolic narrative, stark and compelling in its reality, is represented in this volume by such memorable stories as “The Metamorphosis,” “The Great Wall of China,” “The Judgment,” “In the Penal Colony,” “The Hunter Gracchus,” “The Burrow,” and nine others of equal power and inexorable fascination. (*Fall 1952*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita non-pictorial jacket in vivid reddish orange (34), vivid yellow (82) and black on coated white paper with inset black rectangular panel containing title in vivid yellow and vivid reddish orange and other lettering in reverse; series in black and torchbearer in vivid yellow below panel, all against white background. \n\n> Front flap:<br> No writer in history has illuminated the dark and fantastic side of the human soul with the clarity and perception of Kafka, and this group of stories has been selected to reflect his finest and most representative work. \n> In his brilliant introduction to this volume, Philip Rahv writes, “Kafka so compellingly arouses in us a sense of immediate relatedness, of strong even if uneasy identification . . . because of the profound quality of his feeling for the experience of human loss, estrangement, guilt and anxiety—an experience increasingly dominant in the modern age.” Indeed, Kafka speaks to today’s world with a rarely equaled immediacy and directness of expression. \n> These selected stories comprise fifteen of Kafka’s best-known and most typical works, including “The Metamorphosis,” “In the Penal Colony,” “The Great Wall of China,” “Investigations of a Dog,” and “The New Advocate.” *Note:* Ellipsis in original. \n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *The Penal* *Colony*, translated by Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1946) and *The Great Wall of China*, translated by Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1948). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1952. *WR* 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990. \n\nThe negotiations that resulted in publication of *Selected Stories of Franz Kafka* took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’ hopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty over the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to plan a collection of thirteen stories selected from *The Penal* *Colony* and *The Great Wall of China* in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken Books appears to have agreed verbally to a \\$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the contract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested resuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November 1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would use other translations of the two most important stories and find other material to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949). \n\nCommins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and reported: \n\n> The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken. \n> I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not, whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized. \n> Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens. \n> I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to Cerf, 8 December 1949) \n\nAfter analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins reported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken [*sic*] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items. There are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents which are not protected. These would require new translation, but there would not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are convinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen negotiations with Shocken [*sic*]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January 1950). \n\nKurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported that Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation which were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken proposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make a selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help arrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949). Little had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months later. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of *The Great Wall of China* with additional stories, were still forthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML selection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken to Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May 1951). \n\nCerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the Kafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could produce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken, 16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952 Random House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the publication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great Wall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It is not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus & Young guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random House’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point Schocken capitulated. \n\nThe ML edition of *Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa*, reprinted by arrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared three months later. \n\nThe ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received \\$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been ascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of 5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two printings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders; some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the total of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate within 20,000 copies or so. \n\n#### 453b.

The contract was signed 24 January 1952; the manuscript (except for the introduction) was delivered three months later. Kenneth Rexroth disliked the volume. He told the RH editor David McDowell: “Honest—that ML Greek Poets is awful. ‘Dedicated to proving the proposition that Western European literature is founded on the work of a number of vulgar sentimentalists who wrote illiterate doggerel.’ As somebody once said. Don’t these classics professors have *any* taste at all?” (Rexroth to McDowell, 1 May 1953). \n\nSales totaled 12,984 copies by spring 1958. \n\nAn internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that *The Greek Poets* could not be shifted to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series, because of permissions problems. A decision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November 1968). \n\n",

Even more than a scientific observer of folkways, Margaret Mead was an actual participant in the communal life of a Samoa untouched by Western culture. This record of the psycho-sexual development of pagan youth is an intimate and fascinating contribution to anthropology, ethnography, sociology and psychology. By her comparisons between primitive and modern attitudes toward eroticism, the emotional differences in two remote social and cultural orders are brilliantly illuminated. *Coming of Age in Samoa* is a book of enduring scientific and literary importance.

Discontinued fall 1958. \n\nMead was invited to select one of her books for inclusion in the ML. Her reasons for choosing *Coming of Age in Samoa* are discussed in the preface to the ML edition. She writes: \n\n> My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind, and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.” I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim, by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social invention—are far less likely to seem dated.

The record of his brief life, so tenderly and poignantly portrayed, is the story not so much of suffering and death, but of courage and consideration and selflessness. Besides being one of the rare consolatory books in the world’s literature, it has become immeasurably influential in the campaign to combat cancer.

Until now all their efforts were in vain because the author was adamant in his determination that no selection from his works could be issued during his lifetime in a reprint series. Finally, by special arrangement with Bernard Shaw’s American publishers (Dodd, Mead & Co.) and his estate, we are able to fulfill the twenty-five-year hope and offer in a single volume four of the major plays, with the famous prefaces complete and unabridged. An Introduction by Louis Kronenberger matches the brilliance and perception of the Shavian plays. (*Fall 1953*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1953. *WR* 24 October 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nStein prepared a list of six of Shaw’s plays that he considered desirable for a ML collection: *Arms and the Man*, *Candida*, *Major Barbara*, *Pygmalion*, *Heartbreak House*, and *Saint Joan*. The only important play omitted, he told Cerf, was *Man and Superman* which had a very long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final selection, including the addition of *Caesar and Cleopatra*, was probably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received \\$200 for his introduction (Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953). \n\nIt was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure permission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight control over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of his plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his opposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to publish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s, *Four Plays* and *Saint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956: 484). The only other volume by Shaw in the ML was his early novel *An Unsocial Socialist* (15), published in the series in fall 1917. Originally published in 1887, four years before the United States extended the possibility of U.S. copyright to works by foreign authors, it was in the U.S. public domain. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nShaw, *An Unsocial Socialist* (1917) 15 \nShaw, *Saint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956) 484 \n\n",

His story of Willie Stark, the power-impelled, back-country demagogue, driven and corrupted by success, is a drama of many strands. Interwoven among them all is the central figure of a rogue strong and charming and ruthless enough to seduce either a close friend or an unruly mob. For intensity of action, for an unfailing ear for native colloquialism and for insight into the character and motivations of a man drunk with the compulsion to power, there is no comparable American novel.

The ML edition sold well despite competition from a Bantam paperback.

Friedrich. \n\n*Jacket:* Predominantly non-pictorial in light greenish gray (154) and black on coated white paper with lettering in black except “HEGEL” in title and torchbearer in reverse; decorative drawing of branches of leaves below title. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The enormous influence Hegel has exercised on modern politics and philosophy, on social science, anthropology and psychology demands an examination and evaluation of his most important works, so presented and annotated as to make them comprehensible in themselves and in their relationship to the contemporary world. The essence of Hegelian thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history, philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general reader. *The Philosophy of Hegel* becomes another addition to the Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (*Fall 1953*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1953. *WR* 24 October 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nFriedrich received an advance of \\$750 against royalties of 5 cents a copy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his edition of *The Philosophy of Kant* (422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14 December 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the job” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to the ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a devout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept. think of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late 1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly all of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations about its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead (Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951). \n\nFriedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of selections from *The Philosophy of History* and about fifty pages of *Lectures on Aesthetics* and *Philosophy of Right and Law*. The translation of the main part of *The Philosophy of History* is based on the John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in 1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that he was having to do more work on the translations than he originally hoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952). \n\nIn the first printing the selections from the Introduction to *The* *Philosophy of History* (460a, pp. [1]–43) are from “a translation made by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor, and published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)” (“Note,” p. [2]). Beginning with the second printing the selections from the Introduction (460b, pp. [1]–43) are “translated by Carl J. Friedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind permission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p. [2]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first printing and resetting pp. [1]–42 has not been ascertained. \n\nFriedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold reasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and gratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to Klopfer, 18 January 1960). \n\n#### 460b.

Now, to join its ever-growing representation of the great English poets, the Modern Library makes available a distinguished volume of Blake’s work, including some of his illustrations, chosen by Northrop Frye of the University of Toronto. In addition to selections from the lyrics and shorter poems, from the “prophetic books” such as *The Four Zoas*, *Milton* and *Jerusalem*, there is a generous section of prose which includes letters and some epigrammatic and revealing marginalia. Professor Frye’s Introduction provides a commentary which illuminates both the simplicity of the lyrics and the difficult but consistent symbolism of the prophecies. (*Spring 1953*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication originally announced for spring 1953; published fall 1953. *WR* 19 September 1953. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74; retained in MLCE. \n\n“The definitive edition is that of Geoffrey Keynes, *The Writings of William Blake* (3 vols., 1925), reprinted in one volume as *The Poetry and Prose of William Blake* (4th ed., 1948). The present text, with some rearrangement, reproduces Keynes’s text” (p. xxx). \n\nFrye received a flat fee of \\$350 for writing the introduction and selecting the contents (Stein to Frye, 16 May 1952; 29 May 1952). \n\nFrye made a series of extracts from *The Four Zoas*, *Milton*, and *Jerusalem*. He told Stein, “I have a strong personal repugnance to bits-and-pieces anthologizing, and do this only because I don’t at the moment see anything better to do” (Frye to Stein, 27 September 1952). So little of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get it all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the shorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early prose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they belonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia were included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye to Stein, 5 December 1952). Frye suggested the inclusion of the illustrations (Frye to Stein, 9 June 1952). The original plan was to use ten illustrations, but the number was reduced to eight so they could be bound in as a four-leaf gathering. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nBlake, *Poems* (1921) 92 \nBlake, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne & Complete Poetry of William Blake* (Giant, 1946) G71 \n\n",

In this new volume—for the same enjoyment now that others found then—are the best plays of those colorful years. Here are not only the deeply moving tragedies of Dryden and Otway, but, more importantly perhaps, the ageless comedies of Etherege, Congreve, Wycherley and Vanbrugh—comedies that captured the fine manners, the shimmering wit and the constant intrigue of the gay aristocratic gallants and their ladies. (*Spring 1953*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published fall 1953. *WR* 19 September 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. \n\nHarris received a flat fee of \\$200 for writing the introduction and selecting the plays. Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven plays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid all but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact upon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read and enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to Harris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and recommended omitting *The Beaux’ Stratagem* if only six could be published. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to add *The Rehearsal* (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the number of pages required and agreed to its inclusion. \n\n*Restoration Plays* and *Eighteenth-Century Plays* (1952: 448) were conceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected the plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using the first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe that a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to Harris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to set *Restoration Plays* from first editions of all of the plays except *The Rehearsal*, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition (Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured photostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A textual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for *Eighteenth-Century Plays* appears on p. [iv] of *Restoration Plays*: \n\n> The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first editions. The sole exception is *The Rehearsal*, which is based upon the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author. \n> A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small number of imperative stage directions have been inserted. \n\nHarris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The volume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was twice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the regular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary to Harris, 5 May 1953). \n\n",

At once the master of the lyric poem of incomparable magic and the short story of brilliant inventiveness, Poe has influenced untold numbers of poets and writers, and even today’s science fiction remains greatly in his debt. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also provided notes creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet, short-story writer, literary critic and essayist. Rarely, indeed, can a single volume devoted to a single author present such memorable achievements in various fields of literary effort. (*Fall 1953*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita non-pictorial jacket in moderate olive green (125), moderate brown (58) and black on coated white paper; title in reverse on moderate olive green panel at top, author in large ornamental letters in moderate brown and black, other lettering in reverse on moderate brown panel at foot. \n\n>Front and back flaps: <br> Edgar Allan Poe is one of the most original writers in American letters. His artistic penetration into the heart of things is still being analyzed and discussed with increasing awareness of its depth and complexity. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also provided notes, creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet, short-story writer, literary critic and essayist. It presents a comprehensive view of the man whose influence on American as well as European literature was profound. The art of the short story in America was significantly advanced by Poe, who also shaped the development of the detective story. \n> Poe’s ability to blend the macabre and surreal with consummate craftsmanship has remained a memorable contribution to American literature. (*Spring/Fall 1968*) \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding *The Best Tales of Edgar Allan Poe* (112). Published in MLCE June 1951 and in the regular ML fall 1953. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nMabbott received a flat fee of \\$250 for writing the introduction and selecting the contents. Stein sent him an additional \\$100 when the collection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June 1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been determined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD ARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However, it occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we have a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poem *The Sleeper* on the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in the final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He suggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether (Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950). \n\n*How to Write a Blackwood Article* does not appear in *The Selected Poetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe*, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in the introduction appears to have been cut. *The Sleeper* is included in its final text. \n\n“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A. Harrison’s *Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe* by the kind permission of the publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed from the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case of *The Cask of Amontillado*, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In one or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but preferred by most critics. Poe was a meticulous and thorough reviser of his imaginative works, and instances of unwise revision are exceptionally rare.” (“Note,” p. xvi) \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nPoe, *Best Tales* (1924) 112 \nPoe, *Complete Tales and Poems* (Giant, 1938) G38 ",

Here is a brilliant panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship between the individual and the forces around him.

Stein thought the idea was a good one and indicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo Holborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some required college sale and am quite confident that it will have a satisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October 1953). Holborn received \\$150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11 November 1953). \n\nThe ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the public domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf offered George Allen & Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a courtesy fee of \\$500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any considerable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that will balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities but less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953). The ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen & Unwin and includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C. Middlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged rendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by comparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig Goldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes and has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material preceded by asterisks” (p.

It created methods of reviving the past which will have a lasting influence on the writing of history. Finally, it opened a deep view of the relationship between the human individual and the forces of history.” Rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners and thought of one of the most innovative eras in human history, this brilliant panorama of Renaissance life is also a thorough examination of the nature of civilization and of man’s place within it.

But such additional works as *Beppo* and *The Vision of Judgment*, *English Bards* *and Scotch Reviewers* and the occasional verses penned for his friends show us a poet equally at home in ironic high comedy and biting satire, a poet capable of facing the world and human nature with unwavering realism.

And even in that tradition he is unique, as evidenced by the constantly increasing corps of Hoffenstein devotees. In this book, to their infinite joy and that of the hosts of newcomers who will join their ranks upon its publication, the Modern Library presents the complete Hoffenstein to date, the full texts of his three volumes—*Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing, Year In, You’re Out,* and *Pencil in the Air*. (*Spring 1954*) \n\n*Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing* originally published by Boni & Liveright, 1928; *Year In, You’re Out* originally published by Horace Liveright, 1930; *Pencil in the Air* originally published by Doubleday & Co., 1947.

Discontinued 1 January 1959. \n\nThe ML paid a \\$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Rights to *Pencil in the Air* had reverted to Hoffenstein’s estate, and the advance was divided equally between Liveright and David Hoffenstein, the author’s son. The ML edition sold about 6,000 copies in four and a half years (David Hoffenstein to Cerf, 9 December 1958). When the ML edition was discontinued Cerf wrote to David Hoffenstein, “I am sorry to say that we cannot possibly keep the Hoffenstein Poetry in the Modern Library. Quite frankly, it was one of the very poorest sellers we have ever had in the series. I am just as sorry about this as I know you are” (Cerf to David Hoffenstein, 23 December 1958). \n\n",

Signed: F.K. [Fritz Kredel] \n\n> Front flap:<br> All the elements for thoroughgoing entertainment can be found in this book. The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land remote geographically and in way of life from the western world. It is peopled with potentates and slave girls, robbers and rogues and—above all—a hero, a resourceful, tongue-in-cheek rascal named Hajji Baba. This adventurer’s ups and (mostly) downs take him through every employment from barber to executioner, into caravans, harems, and camps, and introduce him, and us, to every type of individual in the human comedy. We may suspect, as we pursue our hero from one crisis to another, that James Morier is using these tales to comment on the pride, affectation, hypocrisy and chicanery which are universal in human nature, but Hajji Baba himself asks only a relaxed and sympathetic listener for the varied episodes of his career. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nOriginally published 1824. ML edition (pp. [xi]–456) printed from plates of the Cresset Press edition (or a duplicate set of the Cresset plates) published in London, 1949, with the introduction by Richard Jennings and the bibliography omitted, Altick’s introduction added, roman page numerals removed from table of contents, alphabetical signatures removed from text pages (except p. 3, where “A.H.B.” [*Adventures of Hajji Baba*] appears at the left of the bottom margin and the signature “C” appears at the right), and initials “P. P.” removed from p. 456 following the end of the text. Published spring 1954. *WR* 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1960. \n\nRandom House published an edition of *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938 dividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it was printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s format. \n\nStein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an introduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of \\$200, but Haight was too busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953). He then approached Altick, offering him \\$150. He wrote, “What we have in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving largely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth reading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail, but there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a book published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide pleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first appeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his autobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition of James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* . . . which, although it never came near to being one of the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints, earned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one of our daughters” (Altick, *A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an Adventurous Scholar,* p. 200). \n\nAlthough Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three printings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and spring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume. \n\nSeveral months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I have just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an advance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I all change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to Altick, 23 September 1954). \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n",

It has long been the hope of the editors of the Modern Library to include these works in complete form, and now permission to use the distinguished Oxford translations by Roberts and Bywater makes this book possible. To it, Professor Solmsen has contributed a distinguished introduction and a body of helpful notes. (*Fall 1954*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.

Signed: RIKI. \n\n> Front flap:<br> This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats, Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes them unmistakably Irish. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Publication announced for spring 1954 and postponed to fall 1954. *WR* 20 November 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nGreene received a flat fee of \\$750 for his work on the anthology. The permissions budget was limited to \\$1,500, and the scope of the anthology was reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by Yeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted \\$25 per poem for American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate, wanted an additional \\$20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to \\$12.50 per poem, but this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the sales territory for *An Anthology of Irish Literature* to the U.S. and Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The representation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well. \n\nFrank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s *The Midnight Court* for the anthology. \n\n#### 470b.

(*Late 1950s/early 1960s*) \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in strong greenish yellow (99), dark grayish blue (187) and black on coated white paper with oval illustration of the columned porch of a house, gnarled trees hanging with Spanish moss, and a low moon, surrounded by a strong greenish yellow glow and scattered stars; lettering in dark grayish blue and black. Signed: PG [Paul Galdone]. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved. (*Fall 1954*) \n\n*A Curtain of Green* originally published with Porter introduction by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as *A Curtain of Green and Other Stories* by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947. *The Wide Net and Other Stories* originally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. \n\nCerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt, Brace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager sent *A Curtain of Green*, *The Robber Bridegroom*, *The Wide Net*, *Delta Wedding*, and *The Golden Apples*, expressing the hope that the ML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The reprint contract for *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* was signed a month later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk reports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (*Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work*, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete information about printings and sales is not available in the RH archives, but the following evidence is suggestive: *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than 2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and it sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500 titles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the titles that survived. \n\nTextual variants between the first edition of *A Curtain of Green* (Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text of the Modern Library *A Curtain of Green*” (1979). Polk writes: \n\n> In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of *A Curtain of Green*. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of *A Curtain of Green* is two typesettings removed from the first American edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted the Harcourt, Brace text in its *Selected Stories* (NY, 1954), it of course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of *A Curtain of Green* is both the only one currently in print and the text most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6) \n\nIn his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the Harcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in print and the one most frequently cited. \n\n#### 471b.

It appears more likely that it went out of print in 1976 since 471c was published in fall 1977. ",

Here the reader will find authoritative statements by Freud, Adler, Jung, Reich, Abraham, Sullivan, Horney, Alexander, and other distinguished figures too numerous to list. \n> For an understanding of man’s nature and development, his goals and difficulties, his driving forces and defenses—for this and more, the reader will do well to know the substance of this book. (Spring 1955) \n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, edited by J. S. Van Teslaar (108). Published spring 1955. *WR* 25 June 1955. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nThe revision of *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*, originally published in 1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision of *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* (172). Clara Thompson, Executive Director of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology, was recommended by Gardner Murphy shortly after he agreed to revise *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* (Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953). \n\nThompson and her fellow editors tried to present “the many approaches which go to make up a science such as psychoanalysis” (p. [ix]) but ran into major obstacles in securing permissions. W. W. Norton, the publisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to allow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton expressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the original editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not to have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to Stein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was disturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing (Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by these authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to include them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word. \n\nAnna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to appear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections by their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The Emotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.” Gitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative table of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by & large, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of psychoanalysis.” He continued: \n\n> All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel, Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the standpoint from which I view it. . . . \n> Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the “interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954). \n\nAnna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book, *The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense*. “My reason for this,” she wrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the other contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter would create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July 1954). Stein replied: \n\n> In planning the *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, we have tried to represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to a proper view of psychoanalysis. The other category in the collection is controversial material. We have tried to present some impression of the differing viewpoints that now exist. . . . Consequently, many people who differ on a scientific basis with each other will appear in this volume without there being any suggestion that one is right and the other wrong. \n\nHe offered to include a statement in the book “explaining that many different viewpoints are represented here and that the presence of any particular writer’s material . . . does not imply an endorsement of the views expressed by other writers in the book” (Stein to Freud, 8 July 1954). But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your arguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part” (Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \n*Outline of Psychoanalysis,* ed.

Published June 1955. *WR* 25 June 1955. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1959. \n\nThe ML paid Coward-McCann a \\$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Publishers were not enthusiastic about McCord’s title. An earlier reprint changed the title to *The Modern Treasury of Humorous Verse* (Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition under its subtitle, *An Anthology of American and British Humorous and Witty Verse* with *What Cheer* as a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16 July 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave five years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he wrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . . *What Cheer* is short and sweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I wanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I think, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship (the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on to the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954). \n\nMcCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he suggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of people, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could not be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if he really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as well without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included the new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.” Permission fees for the new verses came to \\$220.50; the costs for typesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new to the ML edition were \\$264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955). \n\nFifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t setting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it has justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am proud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three years later he had to tell McCord that *What Cheer* had “dropped so far below our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the series. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as you know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this kind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959). \n\n",

Our world bears little outward relation to the one surveyed by Francis Bacon when, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, he issued his call for the advancement of learning through the method of inductive science. Yet it is precisely his spirit of scientific experimentation which has become the foundation of modern science and, therefore, of the modern world itself. It is then very worth our while to read this volume of Bacon’s greatest writings—the *Advancement of Learning*, the *Novum Organum*, the *New Atlantis* and the famous *Essays*, which show his keen insight into the practical problems of human conduct as well as his mastery of English prose. Professor Dick of the University of California has used various shorter pieces to link these major works and produce in one volume a coherent intellectual autobiography of a great mind.

Johnson was unable to accept and recommended Hugh G. Dick. Stein indicated when he contacted Dick, “We have long felt that we ought to include in the Modern Library a small volume of Francis Bacon’s writings. While we do not expect such a work to sell very widely, we do feel that there is enough need to warrant undertaking it” (Stein to Dick, 20 February 1953). Dick received a flat fee of \\$350 for his work on the volume. \n\nThe ML edition was set from Bacon’s *Works*, edited by James Spedding, R L. Ellis and D. D. Heath (7 vols., London, 1857–74). \n\n",

The endearing qualities of his writings and of the man himself are the same—the simple charm of the essays from *The Citizen of the World*, the tenderness of *The Vicar of Wakefield*, the compassion of *The Deserted Village* and other poems, the hilarity of *She Stoops to Conquer*. An indifferent student in his youth, of law, medicine, and pedagogy, he became an honor graduate of the school of human weakness and suffering—for which the eighteenth century provided ample classrooms. When he finally turned to literature, his experiences were not expressed with the satirist’s biting ridicule but with the genuine warmth, humanity, and humor which have made him a beloved friend of generations of readers.

Hilles received a flat fee of \\$300 for his work on the volume. \n\n“The text of the present edition . . . is based on the earliest version of each selection. . . . Some of the additions which Goldsmith made at a later date have been included, but these are set off within square brackets. An attempt has been made to preserve the original spelling with all its inconsistencies, but obvious misprints have been silently corrected, and some of the long paragraphs in the early essays have been split up.

Six of the best plays by six of the finest new talents are included here: “A Streetcar Named Desire” by Tennessee Williams; “Death of a Salesman” by Arthur Miller; “The Seven Year Itch” by George Axelrod; “Come Back, Little Sheba” by William Inge; and “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial” by Herman Wouk.

It shows Dostoevsky in a variety of moods—tender and romantic in “The White Nights,” satiric in “The Xmas Tree and a Wedding,” revealingly autobiographical in “The Peasant Marey,” pitilessly analytic in “Notes from the Underground,” one of the most significant and impressive things he ever wrote. These stories also show an artistry equal to, and in many ways even surpassing, that of the great novels, powerful and intense as they are. \n> These brilliant modern translations by David Magarshack accomplish one of the most difficult tasks in the world—to transfer great literature to another language and still keep it indisputably great. (*Fall 1955*) \n\nOriginally published by John Lehmann as *A Gentle Creature and Other Stories* (London, 1950). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1955. *WR* 1 October 1955. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1979. \n\nCerf had been interested for some time in publishing a collection of Dostoevsky’s stories in the ML (Linscott to Klopfer, 22 September 1954). Several collections, including *Poor Folk & The Gambler* (Everyman’s Library, 1915), *The Short Novels of Dostoevsky* (Dial Press, 1945), *The Short Stories of Dostoevsky*, ed. William Phillips (Dial Press, 1946) were considered before Magarshack’s volume was selected. Stein offered Magarshack a flat fee of \\$500 to include his collection in the ML. Magarshack tried to negotiate a 10 percent royalty before accepting the offer (Stein to Magarshack, 3 January 1955). The ML re-titled *Memoirs from a Dark Cellar* to the more familiar *Notes from the Underground* and changed references to it in Magarshack’s introduction accordingly. The ML had U.S. rights and nonexclusive Canadian rights. \n\nThe ML followed the usage of the Lehmann edition in transliterating the author’s name as “Dostoevsky.” All other ML editions of the author’s works used the spelling “Dostoyevsky.” In recent decades “Dostoevsky” has become the most common transliteration of the author’s name in English-language editions of his works. “Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821–1881” remains the “authorized form” used in library catalogs to collocate the nearly 50 variant spellings that have been used to represent the author’s name in the Roman alphabet. \n\nSales totaled 15,905 copies by spring 1958. \n\n#### 479b.

The harshness of its reception was natural. It satirized the cranks and charlatans of the post-Civil-War era; its hero was a Southerner; and in its portrayal of the relations of its two leading female characters it skirted a subject then taboo—the theme of sexual abnormality. Today the story of the contest between Olive Chancellor, the arch-feminist, and Basil Ransome, the Southern traditionalist, as to which shall mold and dominate the beautiful, guileless Verena Tarrant has come to be recognized as perhaps the most enjoyable of all the James novels.

Novelist, poet, dramatist, literary critic, philosopher, historian, scientist, political essayist: Voltaire was all these—and always with brilliance of wit and lucidity of style. \n> The most representative figure of the Age of Enlightenment, he remains after two centuries an abundant fountainhead of good sense and of memorable enjoyment to every reader. This immortal talent is richly represented in this volume, edited by Haskell M. Block of the University of Wisconsin with a stimulating introduction on the importance of Voltaire to our own times. (*Spring 1956*) \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding Voltaire, *Candide* (1918: 46). Published May 1956. *WR* 28 May 1956. First printing: Probably 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1985. \n\n“I have attempted to provide an indication of Voltaire’s range and complexity by selecting those works which have most clearly become of a vital part of our intellectual and artistic heritage. . . . The text of this edition has been prepared in the hope of making some improvement over previous English versions. All of the selections are complete. There are no excerpts of letters or parts of chapters. . . . It is hoped that the translations in this collection will help to make a beginning toward an accurate edition of Voltaire in English. In every section of the volume I have provided new translations wherever they were necessary. I should add that the translations from Voltaire’s *Notebooks* are the first from that work to appear in an English edition. . . . Where older translations have been used, they have been thoroughly revised. In particular, for all of the fiction except *Candide*, I have modernized the version of Robert Bruce Boswell. The translation of *Candide* is by Richard Aldington. I am especially grateful to Martyn P. Pollack for the selections from his excellent version of *The Age of Louis XIV*, and to Floyd Gray for his assistance in the translating of Voltaire’s correspondence.” (Editorial Note, pp. xxi–xxii) \n\nThe chapters of *Candide*, like those in the 1930 ML edition (46.2), are set as single paragraphs, following the 1928 Random House limited edition of *Candide*. \n\nSales totaled 14,352 copies by spring 1958. \n\n#### 481b.

Jacket title: *Candide*. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The highly unusual story of a young man booted from Paradise, *Candide* is Voltaire’s most famous novel as well as a scorching indictment of the philosophy of Liebnitz [*sic*], which was summed up by Voltaire in the thought: “All is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.” Candide’s tutor, the philosophic Dr. Pangloss, is the embodiment of this unlikely theory, maintaining it in spite of the most blatant evidence to the contrary. The young Candide is expelled from the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh for making love to the Baron’s daughter, Cunégonde; and thereafter he, Pangloss and Cunégonde embark on what develops into a long series of adventures. Sometimes together, usually apart, in various corners of the earth, they endure a brutal succession of the most unfair and calamitous events conceivable. Eventually they settle down together on a little farm. Candide marries Cunégonde, now grown ugly as a radish, and tells himself often, “We must cultivate our garden.” \n\nPublished spring 1985 at \\$7.95.

He wrote in many forms, in many moods—and in his poetry he tried to cope with a world of shaken beliefs and uncertain values. “In the essential nature of his idealism and his disillusioned melancholy, his pervading sense of irreparable loss,” writes Professor Bush in the Introduction, “he is very much our contemporary, the poet of an age of anxiety.” (*Spring 1956*) \n\nOriginal ML collection.

Signed: Hoffman. \n\n> Front flap:<br> *Brave New World* is a brilliantly satiric novel about life six centuries from now (in “632 After Ford”), the Utopian era in which science has, with juggernaut indifference, triumphed. It is an era of perfect stability, control, conformity. There are, for example, no mothers or fathers because babies are mass-produced from chemical solutions in laboratory bottles; children are completely conditioned for their designated roles as adults in a precisely ordered society. Into this incredible world comes Bernard Marx, hatched in an excessively alcoholic prenatal solution, with ideas worthy of the primitive twentieth century. \n> This is a shocking, fantastic novel, rich in witty entertainment and biting comment. Its status as a classic increases steadily as what seemed imaginary fiction becomes each day more of a reality. (*Fall 1956*) \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights transferred to Harper & Bros., 1938; published with Huxley’s foreword by Harper & Bros., 1946. ML edition (pp. [*5*–*20*], 1–[311]) printed from Doubleday/Harper plates with fly title reset and page numerals removed from foreword and last page of text. Published October 1956. *WR* 15 October 1956. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January1968. \n\nThe ML expressed interest in *Brave New World* several times between 1942 and 1952, but the trade edition was selling too well for Harper’s to consider a reprint. Sales had been small when Harper’s took over *Brave New World* from Doubleday but then increased steadily. Sales tripled in 1939; *Brave New World* sold 100 more copies in 1941 than it had in 1939, giving Harper’s a gross profit that year of \\$300; sales through July 1942 were up 10 percent from the previous year (Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 28 August 1942). Sales remained strong when it was reissued in September 1946 with Huxley’s foreword, with 7,500 copies in print by December (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper & Bros., to Klopfer, 3 December 1946). In 1951 Harper’s sold nearly 2,000 copies in the \\$3.00 trade edition and 7,500 copies in a 95-cent College Edition (Rose to Cerf, 27 May 1952). \n\nHarper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading for Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted” (Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nHuxley, *Point Counter Point* (1930) 203 \nHuxley, *Antic Hay* (1933) 252 \n\n",

Long described as the Jewish Mark Twain, Sholom Aleichem (as Alfred Kazin says in his introduction to this book) “perhaps more than any other Jewish writer who has ever lived, writes about Jewishness as if it were a gift, a marvel, an unending theme of wonder and delight.” The vitality, the laughter, the compassion in these stories are matchless. Peopled as they are with such extraordinary characters as the lovable Tevye, the dairyman, Menachem-Mendel, professional matchmaker, and a host of others, they go beyond their faithful portrayal of the life of the Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern Europe to represent, in a way unequaled by any other writer, the Jewish soul.

Signed: Freund Lurye. \n\n> Front flap:<br> “As time passes,” writes John Gassner, “one name among the post-Ibsen dramatists leads all the rest.” That one is Anton Chekhov, whose major plays are presented here in the remarkably sensitive and skillful translations of Stark Young. \n> For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp and poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding, these plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Chekhov world famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most revered. (*Fall 1956*) \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding *The Plays of Anton Tchekov*, translated by Constance Garnett (193). Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1986. \n\nYoung received a \\$900 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on all copies sold in the U.S. and 5 percent of the net sums received from all copies sold at export. He received an additional \\$100 for writing the introduction. A year before Chekhov’s *Best Plays* was published Stein had reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern Library were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer regarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the excellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays, *The Cherry Orchard*, *The Three Sisters*, *Uncle Vanya*, and *The Sea Gull*. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to Lois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights; there seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this stage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange for the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of course go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo to Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!” \n\nWith the Young translation of Chekhov, *Best Plays* the ML reverted to the spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). \n\n#### 487b.

So revolutionary were these plays in their simplicity and naturalness of form, subject, and dialogue, that to produce them required a new school of acting, and a new Russian theater. Immediately popular in Russia, Chekhov’s plays soon were produced all over Europe. So purely original that they could not be imitated, these plays, with Ibsen’s, laid to rest the outmoded forms of European theater, opening it to innovation in all areas. Today they are as popular as ever. \n\n#### 487c. Reissue format (1978) \n\nTitle as 487a except line 9: [torchbearer M]. \n\nPagination as 487a.

Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nThe ML paid Oxford University Press royalties of 7½ cents a copy on all copies sold in the U.S. and 7½ percent of the net sums received on all copies sold at export. Stein told Cerf that *The Greek Commonwealth* was “one of the classic works on Greek history. This is an account of Athens during the fifth century when art, poetry and drama reached their highest state. Although it is primarily a political and economic account, it seems to me to be one of the clearest pictures of Greece in its finest day” (Stein memo to Cerf, 10 June 1955). Stein also talked to Klopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford University Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered that we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’s *The Greek Commonwealth* and we should like very much to include it in the Modern Library” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955). \n\nAn internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with Oxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transfer *The Greek Commonwealth* to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A decision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November 1968). \n\n",

Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990. \n\nO’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he liked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: *The Doctor’s Son and Other Stories* (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), *Files on Parade* (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), *Pipe Night* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1945) and *Hellbox* (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything from *Pal Joey* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out with Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on O’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the 32 stories in the ML collection were from *Pipe Night* and *Hellbox*. O’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which concluded: \n\n> Most of them [the stories] were written in the twenty years from 1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for *The New Yorker* than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well, damn their eyes. \n\n> I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection, Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, *O’Hara Concern*, p. 233). \n\nThe foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended deleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it (Weil, Gotshal & Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955). Cerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to persuade him to tone down his language: \n\n> Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time, I promise never to mention the matter again. \n> I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence, “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment. This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly concerned even remembers? \n> I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and, furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. [Harold] Ross, who was Editor of the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead; [Brendan] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like. \n> I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands, several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.\n> There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956). \n\nThere is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably telephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf immediately contacted Trilling and offered him \\$500 to write an introduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956). \n\nThere were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, *John O’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography*, p. 216). \n\n#### 489b.

It was not so much that she asserted her emancipation from a stifling marriage, but that Henrik Ibsen himself proclaimed the playwright’s emancipation from the spiritless drama of his time. *A* *Doll’s House*, *Hedda Gabler*, *The Master Builder, Ghosts*, *An* *Enemy of the People*, and *Rosmersholm* advanced the liberation in terms of social drama which revealed human beings confronted with present-day problems and willing to face their consequences. \n> These completely new translations—specially prepared for this edition by Eva Le Gallienne and benefiting from her experience as one of the most thoughtful actresses and directors of the American stage—combine the accuracy, the literary taste and the dramatic naturalness that characterize all distinguished and enduring translations.

(*Spring 1957*) \n\n*King Solomon’s Mines* originally published in London by Cassell & Co., 1885; *She* originally published in London by Longmans, Green & Co., 1887.

Both works appeared in the U.S. in numerous unauthorized editions. \n\nCerf had discussed including *She* or *King Solomon’s Mines* in the ML in 1930, but no decision was reached at that time (Cerf to J.

Michener take on increased interest and importance as informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux. \n> The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer, his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia in rebirth. \n> In this volume are selections from *Tales of the South Pacific*, *Return to Paradise*, *The Voice of Asia*, and the complete text of *The Bridges at Toko-Ri*. (*Spring 1957*) \n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific* (Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of Asia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri* (RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986. \n\nIn the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition of his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the publisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states: \n\n> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi). \n\nMichener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of *Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April 1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August 2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a 1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old Mansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174). \n\nInconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are reproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a jacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of Toko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.” \n\n#### 494b.

They give full evidence of his undisputed rank as the foremost dramatist in all French literature and concededly one of the world’s greatest since Shakespeare. \n> These plays have all been newly translated for this edition by Morris Bishop of Cornell University with skillful fidelity that will establish these translations as the definitive ones of our time.

Even the rarely-at-a-loss-for-words *London Times* concluded a long discussion of his humor in helpless frustration, saying, “Thurber is Thurber.” \n> Perhaps it is best for us to state simply that this is a collection of some of his best writings and drawings. We believe every reader will share our opinion that Thurber is - - - well, is Thurber. (*Fall 1957*) \n\nOriginally published by Harper & Bros., 1945. ML edition (pp. [1]–369) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Harper edition with Thurber’s dedication and foreword omitted, table of contents partially reset, and the preface on pp. 9–11 updated, re-titled (from “My Fifty Years with James Thurber”) and reset. The drawing on the title page is shifted from the half title of the Harper edition. Published November 1957. *WR* 2 December 1957. First printing: 15,000 copies. \n\nCerf had been trying to get *The Thurber Carnival* since 1946, when he offered a \\$6,000 advance to include it in the Giants (Cerf to William Rose, Jr., Harper & Bros., 24 January 1946). Harper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading for Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted” (Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10 percent of the retail price. *Brave New World* (485) was published in the ML in fall 1956. \n\nBowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D of the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month Club using duplicate plates supplied by Harper & Bros. In his list of variations that distinguish state D (p. 55), however, the nose of the dog on the fly title (p. [1]) is indicated as absent. The dog’s nose is present in all ML printings examined. \n\nThurber’s original preface was titled “My Fifty Years with James Thurber” and dated “December 6, 1944.” The re-titled preface in the ML edition, “My Sixty Years with James Thurber,” is identical to the original version except for changes in the first and next-to-last paragraphs. \n\n#### 496b.

The widely varied romances in this volume—presented here in the best modern versions available—will provide many hours of memorably pleasant reading. \n> The editors of this book, Roger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis, both of Columbia University, have skillfully selected those romances best suited to contemporary taste. Their Introduction and their special comments before each story are certain to add to the reader’s enjoyment of this rich legacy of medieval literature. (*Fall 1957*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published November 1957. *WR* 2 December 1957. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nStein had been considering an anthology like *Medieval Romances* for several years. In 1952 he wrote Haskell Block of the University of Wisconsin, “In a very tentative way I have thought of the possibility of our doing a little collection of epic and romance in the Modern Library some day. I don’t know whether such a thing would ever go, but I have been asking people for suggestions as to contents . . .” (Stein to Block, 31 October 1952). \n\nRoger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis initially received royalties of 5 cents a copy. In 1961, when ML books were selling for \\$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based on a retail price of \\$1.45. (*Medieval Romances* was published at \\$1.65, but the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still \\$1.45.) Random House usually rejected requests for higher royalties on these grounds, but the Loomis’s royalties were increased to 10 cents a copy. \n\n#### 497b.

After Laura Hibbard Loomis’s death in 1960 her husband may have asked that her affiliation with Columbia University be removed from the title page and jacket. Roger Sherman Loomis’s affiliation with Columbia continued as professor emeritus from his retirement in 1958 until his death in 1966. \n\n",

Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nReynal & Hitchcock merged with Harcourt, Brace & Co. after Eugene Reynal’s death in 1946. Linscott approached Harcourt, Brace in the mid 1950s for permission to publish a ML abridgement of *The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci* but was turned down. The translation appears to have been in the public domain, and Cerf wrote the following year offering Harcourt, Brace a courtesy fee of \\$300 (Cerf to Jovanovich, 29 March 1956). A contract was signed, and the ML edition carries the statement, “Published by arrangement with Harcourt, Brace and Company” (p. [iv]). \n\nThe translator Edward MacCurdy sometimes used the spelling McCurdy (OCLC authority record \\#1622156). Linscott received a flat fee of \\$1,350 for abridging the text and editing the ML edition. He told Cerf that the project was about twice the work he anticipated because of the poor editing of the complete edition. \n\n*The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci* was the first abridgment that Linscott made for the ML after his retirement from Random House. The others were Vasari’s *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects* (1959: 515) and *The Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson* (1960: 520). \n\n",

Here are represented the wide range of his experiences and of his writing—early Westerns and sketches of “folks back home” with vivid titles like *The Wooing of Nosey Gillespie* and *At Dead Mule Crossing*; or tales, like *The Informal Execution of Soupbone Pew*, picked up in the hobo jungles. From his days as a newspaper reporter and syndicated columnist come accounts like *The Main Event*, sports verse like *A Handy Guy Like Sande*, and affectionate sketches of “ordinary” people like those of Joe and Ethel Turp or My Old Man. And finally, from Runyon’s great days as a Broadway chronicler, we have Hot Horse Herbie, Nicely Nicely, Gentleman George and their fantastic cronies, speaking again in these pages the peculiar vernacular now immortalized as Runyonese.

He did, it is true, call himself a misanthrope and many readers have been quick to regard him solely as a brooding, embittered critic of mankind. \n> Actually, he was an intensely loyal, warm person in his private life and an active, ardent participant in worldly affairs, using his great satiric pen with positive effects on many controversial issues. Readers of *Gulliver’s Travels* already know that the narrative charm of that book is merely one aspect of a work infinitely rich in observation and wisdom. And the broad variety of matters that engaged Swift’s brilliantly incisive mind is fully represented in the many other masterpieces of prose and poetry in this volume.

A savage satire on man and his institutions, written with great wit and invention, *Gulliver’s Travels* has captivated readers for the past two centuries.

The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented, and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of mind.” \n> Time has proved their judgments right, for this engrossing novel of men at war is in fact a testament of our century. It is the story of modern man in a moment of extreme ordeal, dramatically told by an acutely sensitive creative writer. The editors of the Modern Library are proud to include it as a work of distinguished and enduring achievement. (*Spring 1958*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1948.

But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short stories,” wrote *The Saturday Review*. The story of three young men—a Nazi, a Jew, and an American—*The Young Lions* takes place bestween [*sic*] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wrote *The New York Herald Tribune*, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been reconfirmed many times. \n\nPublished spring 1982 at \\$7.95.

(*Fall 1958*) \n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in black and strong brown (55) on coated white paper with title and series in black and author in strong brown, all against white background. \n\n> Front flap:<br> This is the story of Holden Caulfield, a sixteen-year-old boy who, on being dropped by his prep school, decides to spend three days in New York before reporting home. The events of those three days and nights, told in the boy’s own words, form more than a dramatic story. They are the means by which Salinger skillfully portrays the thoughts and feelings of a young boy standing alone and unsure on the threshold of manhood.\n> “Mr. Salinger’s novel,” said Lewis Vogler in the *San Francisco Chronicle*, “is funny, poignant, and in its implications, profound. It is literature of a very high order.” The editors of the Modern Library are pleased to include this novel, which is already widely regarded as a twentieth-century classic. (*Fall 1958*) \n\nOriginally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1951. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–277) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published October 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained but probably around 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64. \n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958 that he wanted to publish *The Catcher in the Rye* and Salinger’s *Nine Stories* (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already available in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at all. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups that patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8 January 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a period of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no photograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to approve the jacket copy. \n\nPrintings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000 and 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962). In the following table ML sales of *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine Stories* chart Salinger’s popularity with precision. \n\nTable: ML sales of Salinger’s *Cather in the Rye* and *Nine Stories*, 1958–63 \n\n<table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 33%\" /> <col style=\"width: 33%\" /> <col style=\"width: 33%\" /> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td></td> <td>CATCHER IN THE RYE</td> <td>NINE STORIES</td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td>Year ending</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td>4/59</td> <td>7,171</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td>4/60</td> <td>9,915</td> <td>7,966</td> </tr> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td>4/61</td> <td>9,935</td> <td>4,680</td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td>4/62</td> <td>23,963</td> <td>14,142</td> </tr> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td>4/63</td> <td>14,014</td> <td>10,478</td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td>TOTAL</td> <td>64,998</td> <td>37,266</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> \n\nSalinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine Stories* not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’ termination notice for *Catcher in the Rye* and indicated that the ML would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to Klopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to Salinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important books in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified a manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000 copies of *Catcher in the Rye* and over 37,000 copies of *Nine Stories* and asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another three years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963). \n\nThere is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in July that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no more printings of *Catcher in the Rye* (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July 1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is included in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer 1964 stock list. \n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering hope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine Stories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through 1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new titles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of *Catcher in the Rye*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when *Four Contemporary French Plays* (598) was published as ML 90. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nSalinger*, Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516 \n\n",

From behind his inscrutable facade, the incomparable Jeeves—confessor, savior, confidant—sagely guides the destinies of Bertie Wooster and his friends. And when things get out of hand, as they invariably do, it is Jeeves who tactfully assumes control to settle matters with his customary incredible ingenuity. \n> For this edition, John W. Aldridge has written an excellent introduction which discusses Wodehouse’s talent—a talent that transforms all readers into devotees. (*Fall 1958*) \n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Carry On, Jeeves!* (George H. Doran Co., 1927) and *Very Good, Jeeves* (Doran, 1930). Published October 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nAldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be making new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that it would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to Aldridge, 19 July 1957). \n\nWodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he would be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in *Carry On, Jeeves!* were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML used most of the first Jeeves book and all of *Very Good, Jeeves*. He also suggested updating several references in the stories and changing the title to *A Gathering of Jeeves* (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August 1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked Wodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that he weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that for Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also asked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories. “Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period and . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary confusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent admirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title *Selected Stories*. “The latter [*A Gathering of Jeeves*] may sound a little bit better, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell best when they state very clearly what the book contains, without reaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August 1957). \n\nWodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared in *New World Writing*, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92. \n\n",

Few men have had as broad and profound an influence as he did. Josiah Royce, for example, described Kant as “the thinker upon whom more than upon any other center, modern thought turns as upon a fulcrum.” \n> The sheer bulk of Kant’s *Critique*—in many ways his central work—has often deterred readers. Now, Norman Kemp Smith, in this authoritative and new translation, provides a skillfully abridged edition from which all minor and repetitive parts have been omitted. The editors of the Modern Library are pleased to include it as one of the great books that all readers will want to own. (*Fall 1958*) \n\nSmith translation originally published in London by Macmillan and Co., 1929; abridged edition published by Macmillan and Co., 1934.

In the early 1950s, when the RH College Dept. was considering publishing a moderately priced edition of Kant’s *Critique of Pure Reason* for classroom use, Stein asked about one hundred academics which translation they preferred. Nearly every respondent named the Smith translation.

There they remained until August 4, 1944, when the *Grüne Polizei* made a raid on the “Secret Annexe” and all the occupants were arrested and sent to German and Dutch concentration camps. In March 1945, two months before the liberation of Holland, Anne died of typhoid in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Only her father, Otto Frank, survived, and it was he who saw that Anne’s diary was published in 1947. \n> Written with rare insight, humor and intimacy, *The Diary of a Young Girl* is one of the classics of our time.

With unsurpassed realism, he depicts their gradual moral and physical degeneration. This “fast-moving, brilliantly conceived study of unbridled brute passion,” as Professor Zulli describes *Cousin Bette* in his Introduction, is added to the Modern Library with pride because it is without doubt one of the great books of our culture.

Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nCerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as 1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a duplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William Targ, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May 1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the *American College Dictionary* in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By deleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the content to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the dictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the *American College Dictionary* by 50 percent would require making much sharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a Giant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with *The Concise Oxford Dictionary*, the Funk and Wagnalls *Desk Standard Dictionary*, and the *Winston Advanced Dictionary* (School Edition). He estimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and that editorial expenses would run about \\$8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott, 18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans to publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. *The* *Modern Library Dictionary* (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000 entries. \n\n*The Modern Library Dictionary* was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall 1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because new business machines acquired by Random House could not handle number-letter combinations. Copies of *The Modern Library Dictionary* that remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number “1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets. \n\nThe *First* statement on the verso of the title page appears to have been removed on all subsequent printings. \n\n",

Auden. In the opinion of many, he is regarded as the foremost poet of our time. \n> It is with particular pride, therefore, that the publishers of the Modern Library make this book available to the large number of readers who have long wished for such a volume. \n> This book contains a generous selection of Auden’s poetry. Here the reader will find constant enjoyment in the spirited wit, the wide-ranging intellect, the emotional power, and the unsurpassed artistry that are among Auden’s characteristics. (*Spring 1959*) \n\nOriginally published in Britain as *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. *WR* 23 February 1959. First printing: 7,500 copies. \n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for the ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of *The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden* which Random House published in 1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer turned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in Vintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback edition because *Collected Poetry* was selling so well (Klopfer to Alfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957). \n\nThe ML reprinted *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* because Auden did not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered buying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S. copyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been set in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention, which the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement for works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S. citizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer wrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might invalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set of proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of uncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the Penguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7 July 1958). \n\nAuden included the following note on p. [*8*] following the table of contents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the chronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the last from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony or sense or both”. \n\nThe ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson report a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings of 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two printings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and 7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969). \n\n#### 510b.

The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.” \n> Four years later *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects* was published in Florence. The time and the man had come together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian Renaissance. \n> Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (*Fall 1959*) \n\nML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London by the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959. *WR* 19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nLinscott received a flat fee of \\$1,500 for his editorial work. He originally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs. Jonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the DeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser translation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000 words.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the manuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s worth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates” (Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume DeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the U.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of pictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable moralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential Vasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to change the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has been done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a building it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American readers” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957). \n\nLinscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he thought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and an expensive illustrated edition by S & S [Simon and Schuster] with disgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print. Instead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff, inaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly accurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957). \n\n",

S<span class=\"smallcaps\">alinger</span>; [*2*] blank; [*3*] title; [*4*] *First Modern Library Edition, 1959* | *Copyright, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1953, by J. D. Salinger*; [*5*] dedication; [*6*] blank; [*7*] epigraph; [*8*] blank; [*9*] Contents; [*10*] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–302 text; [303–308] ML list; [309] American College Dictionary advertisement; [310] blank. (*Spring 1959*) \n\n*Jacket A:* Non-pictorial in vivid yellowish green (129), vivid purplish blue (194) and black on coated white paper with lettering in black overlapping white diamond-shaped panel except author and series in vivid purplish blue; background in vivid yellowish green. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Pick up this book and start reading a story, any story. Choose from intriguing titles like “A Perfect Day for Bananafish” or “For Esmé—With Love and Squalor,” and start anywhere. Chances are that you will be in on a conversation, one so fresh and immediate that you will seem to be hearing, not reading it. You have entered the world of J. D. Salinger, and you will continue reading until you have finished all nine stories. Who are these extraordinary people, these grave and knowing children, what is happening to them, what are they revealing about past events, about themselves, about their dealings with each other and the world? The author does not tell you directly but you find out for yourself from their every word, gesture, and act. \n> When you have finished, you will understand why Arthur Mizener recently called Salinger “probably the most avidly read author of any serious pretensions in his generation,” and his work “the most interesting fiction that has come along for some time.” (*Fall 1959*) \n\nOriginally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1953. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–302) printed from Little, Brown plates with decorative rules removed from table of contents, fly title and chapter heads in all printings of 516a. Published September 1959. *WR* 28 September 1959. First printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65. \n\nCerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped *Nine Stories* could be included in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He subsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint *The* *Catcher in the Rye* (504) and *Nine Stories* in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger asked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the entry for *The Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the president of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal notice that termination of the *Nine Stories* contract would become effective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand. \n\nThe Little, Brown half title (*Nine Stories*) is sandwiched between two decorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “*by* J. D. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The ML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | *OF THE WORLD’S BEST BOOKS* followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line statement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated folder listing each volume in the series. \n\nPrintings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960), 15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing in spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of *Nine Stories* are included in the entry for *The* *Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504). \n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering hope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine Stories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through 1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new titles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of *Nine Stories*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when *Renaissance Philosophy,* vol. 2: *The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611) was published as ML 301. \n\n#### 516b. Decorative rules restored (1963) \n\nTitle page as 516a. \n\nPagination and collation as 516a. \n\nContents as 516a except decorative rules above and below “Contents” on pp. [*9*], fly title on p. [1], and title headings of each of the nine stories on pp. 3, 27, 57, 83, 111, 131, 174, 198, 253; [303-308] ML list; [309-310] MLG list. (*Spring 1963*) \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except “J. D. Salinger” on front panel and backstrip, “A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK”, torchbearer, and ML number on backstrip in deep red (13) instead of vivid purplish blue. (*Spring 1963*) \n\nLittle, Brown printings had decorative rules; earlier ML printing did not. The spring 1963 printing is the earliest seen with decorative rules. It was probably photographed from a Little, Brown printing and printed by offset lithography. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nSalinger, *The Catcher in the Rye* (1958–1963) 504 \n\n",

The selections range from the terse epigrams of the *Journal* through the famous “Diary of the Seducer” and the “Banquet” scene, in which S. K. reveals his great lyric and dramatic gifts, on to the philosophical and psychological works of his maturity. These are climaxed by the beautiful and moving religious discourses which accompany them; finally there is the biting satire of his *Attack upon* “*Christendom*.” \n> This is emphatically not a collection of “snippets,” but the cream of Kierkegaard, each selection interesting and intelligible in itself, and all ranking among his most important work. As the *New York Herald Tribune* commented, Mr. Bretall “has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what such remarks should be.” (*Fall 1959*) \n\n*Jacket B1:* Pictorial in deep orange yellow (72), vivid reddish orange (34) and black on coated white paper with sketch of Kierkegaard at left and lettering in black, vivid reddish orange and deep orange yellow, all against white background; lettering on spine against deep orange yellow background. \n\n> Front flap:<br> First paragraph as 518a except “S. K.” is replaced by “Kierkegaard” and “on to the philosophical and psychological works” is replaced by “and continues with the philosophical and psychological works of his maturity.” \n> Second paragraph abbreviated with square brackets and ellipsis in original: “[Mr. Bretall] has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what such remarks should be.” —**New York Herald Tribune** (*Spring 1967*) \n\nOriginally published by Princeton University Press, 1946.
