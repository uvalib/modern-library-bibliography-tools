They have participated in its blood-stirring events not by following the career of notable and spectacular personages, but by identifying themselves with Sydney Carton, the Defarges and the other obscure people who lived and died during the reign of terror.

In addition, pp. 395–96 were adjusted with minor resetting to accommodate the last three lines of text that appeared on p. 397 in earlier printings."
