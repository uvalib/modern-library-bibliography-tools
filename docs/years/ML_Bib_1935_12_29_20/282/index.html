Unsigned. Front flap: Robinson Jeffers’ position as the writer of the most challenging poetry of our time is now generally conceded. The spiritual tragedies that he sets against the rocky landscape of the Pacific coast reveal all the fierce intensity and overwhelming beauty of his unique gifts. WhenRoan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poemswas first published a new and elemental force in our native poetry was acclaimed. Now, in the Modern Library, it wins new adherents for the poet of the dark labyrinths of the human soul. (Spring 1935) Originally published by Boni & Liveright, 1925. ML edition printed from newly set plates. Published May 1935.WR25 May 1935. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 31 December 1959. The original B&L plates were too large for the ML’s format and new plates had to be made for the ML edition. Cerf gave Jeffers an opportunity to revise the text but he declined. In the introduction he stated: “. . . it is a pleasure to write, but after a thing has been written I hate to see it again; poems are the sort of children that it is delightful to beget, dreary to educate. . . . So I made terms with my conscience and my publisher: ‘If you’ll let me off revising I’ll write an introduction instead; that will only take a few hours, the other would take weeks’” (p. vii).Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poemssold 2,403 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the bottom quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales. 282b.

(Spring 1955) Jacket:Enlarged version of 282a in very deep red (14) instead of vivid reddish orange with horizontal rules omitted. Front flap as 282a. (Spring 1941) Front flap rewritten: For many years Robinson Jeffers has maintained a distinguished place among the poets of America. WhenRoan Stallion,Tamar and Other Poemswas first published a new and elemental force in our native poetry was acclaimed. The fierce tragedies enacted against a background of the rocky landscape of the Pacific Ocean revealed the brooding and tortured men and women whose hearts Jeffers searched. In poem after poem over many years, he has explored the dark labyrinths of the human spirit. Without compromise or concession he has pursued his search and written about the stark beauty of a rugged landscape and the agonized gropings of a people at war with their environment and themselves.
