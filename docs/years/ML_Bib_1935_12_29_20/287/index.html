The authority and the informality ofThe Amenities of Book-Collectingmade it the unanimous choice of the editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to be welcomed into the series.

McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24 August 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just returned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we had a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that time I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library edition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to you and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about it” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he would be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25 February 1935)."

      "#text": "The Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf initially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he wanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750 against royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay only 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after which the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think that Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure that every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale of at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the book is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the pages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935)."
    },
    {
      "#text": "Cerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the $750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset “would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result may not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough to suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The Polygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the plates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work, including all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints (make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408 for 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935)."

      "#text": "Newton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf invited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant not only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but special attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words, the new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new review of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to Newton, 25 April 1935)."
