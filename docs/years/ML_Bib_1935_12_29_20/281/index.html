    "With the publication of her first novel,The Time of Man, Elizabeth Madox Roberts attained the front rank among living American writers. The glowing beauty of her work, its insight, its vividness and lyrical flow give to this chronicle of the American soil a distinction shared by few novels of our time. The story of Ellen Chesser is an American idyl that captures the grim and exalted meaning of the pioneer’s struggle with the land. It is a book that has earned its own and its author’s eminence. (Spring 1935)",
