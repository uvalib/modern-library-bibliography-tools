Representative of the poetry from the earliest days of English verse down to the last rhymed witticisms of contemporary singers, this anthology is always on the side of excellence and good taste. The spontaneous gaieties of Shakespeare and Dorothy Parker, Pope and Ogden Nash, W. S. Gilbert, Lewis Carroll, Calverley, Edna St. Vincent Millay and scores of others are captured in a book that mocks at solemnity and banishes the sober mood. (Fall 1934)"

Cerf wrote Kronenberger in 1932 and 1933 asking when the anthology would be ready. When Kronenberger indicated in November 1933 that he would deliver the manuscript the following week, Cerf replied: “The Board of Directors of the Modern Library has passed a resolution unanimously to the effect that the Anthology will be much more welcome in this dignified sanctum than the compiler thereof. The book had better be good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933). The anthology sold 5,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales."
