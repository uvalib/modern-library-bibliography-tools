Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we had a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that time I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library edition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to you and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about it” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935).

McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think that Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure that every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale of at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the book is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the pages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935)."

The Polygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the plates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work, including all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints (make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408 for 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935)."
