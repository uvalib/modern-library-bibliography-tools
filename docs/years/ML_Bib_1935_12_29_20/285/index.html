    "The winner of the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature, Thomas Mann, stands pre-eminent among living writers. His fame rests chiefly on two novels,The Magic MountainandBuddenbrooks. For more than three years,The Magic Mountain(#200) has maintained its position as one of the five best sellers on the Modern Library list. With the addition ofBuddenbrooksto the series, it is safe to predict that it will take rank with its illustrious predecessor as a book of immense popular appeal. (Fall 1935)",
    "Lowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Alfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. [7]–389; [1]–359) printed from Knopf plates. Published October 1935.WR2 November 1935. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.",
    "The ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third printings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The reprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an eighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200 advance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining copies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of Knopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies (or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing under the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML reported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the bindery and thatBuddenbrookswould be completely out of stock within a few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty statement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting sales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance."
