    "The fame of W. Somerset Maugham rests securely on two novels. The first,Of Human Bondage(No. 176), has steadily maintained its position as one of the two best sellers on the entire Modern Library list during the last three years. The second,The Moon and Sixpence, now takes its place in the series with the promise of competing for popular favor with its celebrated predecessor. This story of Charles Strickland, driven by the demon of his genius to the South Seas, parallels in many respects the strange life of Paul Gauguin. (Spring 1935)",

    "The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML printed 43,500 copies by August 1944. Sales were about 2,000 copies a year in the late 1930s but increased to about 7,000 copies a year after the United States entered the war (Ray Freiman memo to Robert Haas, 13 November 1944).The Moon and Sixpencesold 11,156 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it twenty-first out of 271 ML and Giant titles.

    "Freiman reported in 1944 that the plates, though not perfect, could be used for several more years, but Haas decided to make new plates for Maugham’sOf Human Bondage(199) andThe Moon and Sixpenceat the same time. Freiman contacted Doubleday, Doran to determine whether it was willing to supply new plates or at least pay part of the cost (Freiman memo to Haas, 13 November 1944). Doubleday, Doran agreed to reset and replate both titles at its own expense as long as the ML agreed to keep them in print and promote them aggressively for at least ten years (Cedric R. Crowell, Doubleday, Doran, to Commins, 2 January 1945). The new plates were delivered to the ML’s printers in December 1945. The ML instructed Parkway Printing Co. to dispose of the old plates and use the new ones for all future printings (Regina Spirito to Bill Simon, Parkway Printing, 13 December 1945). The first printing from the new plates (not seen) was for 7,000 copies in April 1946."
