    "John Reed’s eye-witness account of the ten most decisive days of the Russian Revolution has become an authentic historical document and a vivid, moment-to-moment narrative of the Bolshevik rise to power. Reed, American-born and graduate of Harvard, lies buried beneath the Kremlin wall in Moscow, an almost legendary figure in the hierarchy of national heroes and martyrs of the Revolution. His book is recognized internationally as a faithful record of the events leading to the dictatorship and the dominance of the Soviet system in Russia. It is required reading for those who want to know how Communism first took over the government of one-sixth of the world. (Fall 1953)",

    "Ten Days That Shook the Worldunrolled in November, 1917, when the Bolsheviks, in a second revolution, seized power from the government that had succeeded the Czar. John Reed wrote this eyewitness account of the Bolshevik Revolution as reportage, as personal history, as propaganda, but also as raw history. Published in 1919, and written before the rise of an official Communist version of these events (Trotsky here still stands beside Lenin, and Stalin is nowhere to be found), it still retains its value as history; but more important than this, it helped create an image, a myth, of the Bolshevik Revolution which was enormously influential in America, in other countries where the book was widely circulated, and in Communist Russia itself, where it was translated by Lenin’s wife and introduced enthusiastically by Lenin.",
    "The present edition ofTen Days That Shook the Worldhas a new introduction by Bertram D. Wolfe, author ofThree Who Made a Revolution, which relates this important work to our current knowledge of the Russian Revolution. (Fall 1960)",
    "Printed from newly set plates that were also used for a paperback edition in Vintage Books. Vintage and ML editions published fall 1960.",
    "The plates used for 280.1 had become badly worn when the ML decided to bring out a new edition. Wolfe received $1,000 for his introduction. Reed’s notes were shifted from the appendix to the end of each chapter. Wolfe suggested the addition of an index."
