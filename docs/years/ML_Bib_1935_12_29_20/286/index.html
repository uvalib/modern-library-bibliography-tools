Signed: illegible. Front flap: Millions of people have enjoyedShow Boatin at least one of its many manifestations. First as a book it was a national best seller. As a play, a musical comedy, a weekly radio feature for three years, and, in its latest version, an operatic film,Show Boat, like the river it celebrates, rolls on forever. Now in the Modern Library series, Edna Ferber’s famous chronicle of the Mississippi summons a new audience to Captain Andy Hawks’ floating palace of entertainment. Jerome Kern, the well-known composer, provides a foreword. (Fall 1935) Originally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1926. ML edition (pp. [ix]–398) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates with pp. [2–3] adapted from the original title page with the imprint removed and the title printed in smaller type. Published November 1935.WR30 November 1935. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 31 December 1940. Daniel Longwell of Doubleday, Doran asked Cerf in 1934 if Ferber’sShow BoatorSo Bigcould be included in the ML “in however small an edition” and indicated that no advance on royalties would be required. “It would help us tremendously,” he observed, “to be able to tell Edna Ferber right now that you are going to do that” (Longwell to Cerf, 4 April 1934). Cerf replied that nothing could be done during the coming season. “Our Fall Modern Library list already includes THE GREAT GATSBY, PORGY, and LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL, and that is more than enough Americana for this one installment!” (Cerf to Longwell, 9 April 1934).Show Boatappeared in the ML the following year and was discontinued five years later. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper."
