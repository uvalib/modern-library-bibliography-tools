    "Within the last three decades the American drama has challenged and overcome European domination in the theatre. The emergence of our internationally famous playwrights has won the world’s attention and respect. This volume, representative of the finest work of America’s foremost dramatists, brings together[+,] for the excitement and delight of the reader [+, a half dozen] plays in a variety of moods and forms: Eugene O’Neill’s imaginativeThe Emperor Jones, Maxwell Anderson’s tenseWinterset, Kaufman and Hart’s satiricalThe Man Who Came to Dinner, Lillian Hellman’s bitterly penetratingThe Little Foxes, Tennessee Williams’ sensitiveThe Glass Menagerie, and Heggen and Logan’s robust comedyMister Roberts.

    "Original ML anthology. Published fall 1951.WR29 December 1951. First printing: Not ascertained.",
    "Six Modern American Playswas originally intended for Modern Library College Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and addedlater to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee $150 for selecting the plays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950). Halline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline began by suggesting Anderson’sWinterset, Kaufman and Hart’sThe Man Who Came to Dinner, O’Neill’sMourning Becomes Electra, Robert Sherwood’sThere Shall Be No Night, Philip Barry’sHotel Universe, and Sidney Howard’sYellow Jack. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who rejectedHotel UniverseandYellow Jackand indicated his preferred for O’Neill’sEmperor Jonesand Sherwood’sAbe Lincoln in Illinois.",
    "Stein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’sLittle Foxes. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new dramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’sGlass MenagerieorA Streetcar Named Desire, Arthur Miller’sDeath of a Salesman, or Heggen and Logan’sMister Roberts;his own preference, he indicated, was Williams. Halline approvedThe Emperor Jones,Abe Lincoln in IllinoisandThe Glass Menagerie(Halline to Stein, 28 September 1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup:The Emperor Jones,Winterset,The Man Who Came to Dinner,The Little Foxes,The Glass Menagerie, andAbe Lincoln in Illinois. Sherwood’s play was dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission.Death of a Salesmanwas the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty than the ML was prepared to pay.Mister Robertswas finally selected, in part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid royalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay half a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition.",
    "In the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the introduction only.",
    "Stein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out the anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The costs of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College Edition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find some way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline, 25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951).Six Modern American Playswas added to MLCE in the mid-1960s.",
    "O’Neill’sEmperor Jonesis reprinted in the version originally published by Boni and Liveright in 1921. For more information see O’Neill,The Emperor Jones; The Straw(1928: 157).",
