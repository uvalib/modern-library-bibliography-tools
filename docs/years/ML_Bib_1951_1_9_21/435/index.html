Front flap: Included in every list of great books are Cicero’s orations. For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have cherished the hope of bringing into the series not only the orations, but the essays and letters of Cicero within the compass of a single compact volume. Only when Professor Hadas provided the means by which the writings of one of the greatest of the Romans could be presented in the best of a variety of translations was this aim achieved. Now such essays as “On Moral Duties,” “On Old Age,” “Scipio’s Dream” and “On the Character of the Orator” and the orations “Against Catiline” and the “Second Philippic,” as well as a generous assortment of Letters, make a volume of immense value to the scholar and general reader alike. (Spring 1951) Original ML collection. Published spring 1951.WR9 June 1951. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. Published initially in ML and subsequently in MLCE. Hadas received a flat fee of $500 for his editorial work. Sales totaled 21,030 copies by spring 1958."
