    "For many years the editors of the Modern Library, in response to frequent suggestions from readers of the series, have sought a volume containing the representative writings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Now, thanks to the scholarly [-and perceptive] research of [+the late] Donald A. Stauffer, [+who was] Chairman of the English Department, Princeton University, [-who contributes a brilliant introduction,] the best of Coleridge’s poetry, essays and criticism are here collected and arranged for the delight of the student and general reader. Included in this book of 636 pages are such favorite poems as “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” “Kubla Khan,” many odes, sonnets and hymns, as well as essays on Shakespeare, on philosophy, morals and religion [+, and Stauffer’s brilliant and perceptive Introduction]. (Fall 1951; [±Fall 1956])",
    "Original ML collection. Published fall 1951; initially published in MLCE.WR17 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.",
    "Originally published 1951 in MLCE and later that year in the regular ML. Stein initially approached Earl Leslie Griggs of New York University about editing the volume, but Griggs declined on the grounds that he had edited an edition of Coleridge for Ronald Press some years before (Stein to Griggs, 12 July 1950). He then offered Stauffer $250 to prepare the MLCE collection (Stein to Stauffer, 4 August 1950).",
    "Commins told Stauffer before the book was published, “When the contract was originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition of SELECTED POETRY AND PROSE OF COLERIDGE, we could not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer, 28 June 1951). Stauffer received an additional $100 when the regular ML edition appeared.",
    "The poetry was set fromThe Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. E. T. Coleridge (Clarendon Press, 1912).Biographia Literaria, included in its entirety, was set from the edition of J. Shawcross (Clarendon Press, 1907). Coleridge’s critical essays, “Romeo and Juliet” and “Hamlet, 1813,” were set fromShakespearean Criticism, ed. T. M. Raysor (Harvard University Press, 1930). The remaining prose was set from Coleridge’sComplete Works, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (7 vols., Harper & Bros., 1853). MLCE printings acknowledged the Clarendon Press; the acknowledgement did not appear in the regular ML edition, which concerned Stein (RH box 783)."
