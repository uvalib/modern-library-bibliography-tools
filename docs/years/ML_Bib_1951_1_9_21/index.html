The series maintained close ties with the regular Modern Library series during this time.  Most titles continued to be selected from the regular Modern Library series and adapted with new introductions for the college market. However, anthologies of works by Browning, Byron, Keats, and Shelley were compiled especially for Modern Library College Editions. The Keats and Shelley anthologies were also published in the regular Modern Library in spring 1951; the Browning and Byron volumes were added to the regular series in 1954."

In contrast to the initial group of forty-one non-royalty bearing titles, several of those added in 1951 required royalty payments. Despite these additions, the Modern Library College Editions began to encounter difficulties in its second year. Production costs were going up and college enrollments temporarily declined as the pool of former soldiers attending college on the G.I bill exhausted. The series did not fully recover until 1956.  Thereafter, sales continued to be strong.  The series maintained its position in the 1960s when the regular Modern Library began to falter and continued throughout the 1970s after the regular series became moribund."

These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing (there are no records of printings in 1953, 1955, and 1958) but the total of 86,000 copies for the period 1951–62 is probably accurate within 15,000 copies or so."

Now such essays as “On Moral Duties,” “On Old Age,” “Scipio’s Dream” and “On the Character of the Orator” and the orations “Against Catiline” and the “Second Philippic,” as well as a generous assortment of Letters, make a volume of immense value to the scholar and general reader alike.

This novel still reflects an era in America’s development and offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on our national character."

In order to bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer, 28 June 1951).
