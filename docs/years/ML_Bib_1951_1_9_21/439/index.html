Front flap: The glory that was Greece is ours for the reading. Here is the rich heritage from the golden age of the drama. The tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes are timeless. Today, as it was twenty-five centuries ago, the insight of these dramatists into the spirit of man and his relationship to nature, to society and to his own soul is deeply rewarding and stirring. The seven plays in this volume are unmatched in all the literature of the drama for intensity and magnitude and boisterous humor.

Signed: RIKI. Front flap as jacket A. (Fall 1955) Original ML anthology supersedingFour Famous Greek Plays, ed. Paul Landis (1929: 178). Contents drawn fromThe Complete Greek Drama, ed. Oates and O’Neill in the Lifetime Library (2 vols., Random House, 1938). Published spring 1951.WRnot found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Originally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted thatFour Famous Greek Plays(178) would have to be completely revised. He told Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the Modern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart Edition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In addition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more specifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we prepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based upon the Lifetime Library [Random House] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK DRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give the College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted thatSeven Famous Greek Playswould differ from the Rinehart anthology in the following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have Euripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally desirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I think for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do not.” Stein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library edition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he indicated that the use of these translations would depend on the permission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit the ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions that prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the general introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein concluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book available for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of July 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1 February 1950). Oates received a flat fee of $200 for his general introduction to Greek tragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a flat fee of $100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the introduction toThe Frogs. Permission fees included $100 each for Aldington’s translation ofAlcestisand Murray’s translation ofThe Frogs; More’s translation ofPrometheus Boundappears to have required a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional $100 whenSeven Famous Greek Playswas added to the regular ML (Commins to Oates, 28 June 1951). 439b.
