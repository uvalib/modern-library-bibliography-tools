    "The third full-length novel and the fourth title in the Modern Library series by Joseph Conrad (Lord Jim, No. 186,Victory, No. 34, and “Heart of Darkness” inGreat Modern Short Stories, No. 168),Nostromois regarded by devoted Conradians as his most exciting tale of high adventure. The story of a man of fabulous daring somewhere on the South American seaboard during the turmoil of a revolution is far more than the recital of astounding feats; it is a drama of large-scale conflicts against a background of a strange land and the vast sea, told with power and insight and the subtle interplay of light and shadow. Robert Penn Warren, author ofAll the King’s MenandWorld Enough and Time, contributes an illuminating and perceptive introduction. (Spring 1951)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Harper & Bros., 1904; subsequently published by Doubleday, Page & Co.; author’s “Note” added 1918. ML edition printed from Harper/Doubleday plates. Publication announced for spring 1951.WR3 November 1951. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1983.",
    "Published 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. The ML paid Doubleday royalties of 8 cents a copy for the ML edition. Stein asked several professors about includingNostromoin MLCE and decided to go ahead despite the lukewarm response. Doubleday wanted it to be included in both the regular ML and MLCE because royalties for the MLCE edition were only 2 cents a copy. Doubleday indicated that two sets of plates were available, one of 631 pages in excellent shape and one of 537 pages in poor condition. Stein recommended thatNostromobe included in the regular ML and that the better plates be used (Stein memo to Haas, 15 August 1950).",
    "AfterNostromoentered the public domain Klopfer inquired if a lower royalty would be appropriate. He was informed that Doubleday continued to receive full royalties on other editions and replied, “As long as everybody else is paying regular royalties certainly I don’t want to alter the terms. It’s just when a book actually gets kicked around in the public domain that we feel a change in arrangements should be made” (Klopfer to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 14 November 1963; Barbara Drysdale, Doubleday, to Klopfer, 6 December 1963; Klopfer to Drysdale, 12 December 1963).",

    "Joseph Conrad is considered by many critics to be the best English novelist of his generation, andNostromois often mentioned as the greatest of his novels. Written in 1904,Nostromois set in a small South American country. Against this tropical background Conrad has assembled an unusual assortment of men. Empire builder, rebel leader and outcast are all involved in conflicts of heroic proportions. The tragic values embodied in this novel make it apparent why Conrad thought of it as his most finely worked creation.",

    "Set in the civil-war-torn Central American Republic of Costaguana,Nostromois “a complex of personal stories,” Robert Penn Warren observes, involving conflicts of heroic proportions and tragic consequences. From the materialist Charles Gould, owner of the Gould Concession of the San Tomé mine, and the traitorous Dr. Monygham, to old Georgio Viola and the sceptic Decoud, each character lives an illusion next to the “natural” man Nostromo and the beneficent Emilia Gould. A novel that reveals the nefarious effects of unbridled greed and imperialist interests,Nostromoupholds Conrad’s belief in fidelity, moral discipline, and the need for human communion. Conrad himself described it as “an intense creative effort on what I suppose will remain my largest canvas,” and it is considered one of his greatest works. It is an exemplary statement of his conviction that “the solidarity of all mankind” rests upon “simple ideas and sincere emotions.”",
