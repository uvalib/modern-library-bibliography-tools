[1–11]16[12]8[13]16 [i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] COPYRIGHT, 1936, BY WILLIAM FAULKNER | COPYRIGHT, 1951, BY RANDOM HOUSE, INC. |FirstMODERN LIBRARYEdition| 1951; v–xii INTRODUCTION |By Harvey Breitdated p. xii: New York | January, 1951.; 7–378 text; [379–380] CHRONOLOGY; [381–383] GENEALOGY; [384–385] map of Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha Co., Mississippi; [386] blank; [387–392] ML list; [393–394] ML Giants list. (Spring 1951) Jacket A:Pictorial in strong blue (178), brilliant yellow (83), deep brown (56) and black on coated white paper depicting a woman standing on driveway to a mansion under a canopy of trees hanging with Spanish moss; lettering in reverse and brilliant yellow. Signed: PG (Paul Galdone). The ML jacket echoes George Salter’s jacket for the 1936 RH edition, which “creates an eerie view of a house through foreground foliage” (Hansen, p. 96), but is perhaps more effective in attracting prospective buyers to the book. Front flap: The editors of the Modern Library, responsive to the growing demand that as many titles as possible of the works of William Faulkner be constantly available, are proud to addAbsalom, Absalom!to the series. Originally published in 1936 and long out of print, this novel has commanded huge prices in the rare book market, but is now brought within the means of every book buyer. Considered by every critic one of the major novels among the nineteen volumes written by the recent Nobel Prize winner,Absalom, Absalom!stands withSanctuary(Modern Library No. 61),The Sound and the FuryandAs I Lay Dying(No. 187) andLight in August(No. 88) as a distinguished achievement in the literature of the South and of the entire world. (Spring 1951) Originally published by Random House, 1936, with folding map tipped in following p. 384. ML edition (pp. 7–[383]) printed from RH plates with fly title leaf (pp. [5–6]) omitted, blank page before Chronology omitted, page numerals (380–384) removed from Chronology and Genealogy, and map redrawn to fit the ML’s format. Published spring 1951.WR21 April 1951. First printing: 10,000 copies. Absalom, Absalom!was out of print in 1950 and very difficult to find. Frances Steloff, proprietor of the Gotham Book Mart, wrote Cerf: This is to serve notice that you will not have peace or rest until you promise to reprintAbsalom, Absalom. We have been advertising for many months without receiving a single quotation. Now at last I get the enclosed [a quotation from a dealer offering a copy at $74.25]. I called the guy up just to see if he was serious, and sure enough the 25¢ is for postage and insurance, he explains, rare books must be insured. The last copy we sold for $20.00 and I thought we were robbing the poor customer, but there is no other way to lay hands on this title. We have a poor student in Germany who made great sacrifices to get $7.50 to us; about six months ago we thought we could supply one at that price. And so we keep on searching without success. It is as you must know the most important of all Faulkner titles, and Faulkner has been on the up and up for the last two years. Will you take my word for it that it will be the best selling title in the Modern Library for a very long time. I had hoped to avoid annoying you and thought I would extract a promise from Saxe [Commins] but he passed the buck (Steloff to Cerf, [April 1950]; quoted in Morgan, “Frances Steloff and the Gotham Book Mart,” pp. 741–42). Subsequent printings of 434a were as follows: two printings of 5,000 copies each (1952), 5,000 copies (1954), 5,000 copies (1956), 5,000 copies (1957), 7,000 copies (1959), two printings of 7,000 copies each (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing (there are no records of printings in 1953, 1955, and 1958) but the total of 86,000 copies for the period 1951–62 is probably accurate within 15,000 copies or so. 434b.Breit introduction dropped (1963) Title as 434a through line 3; lines 4–5: [torchbearer H] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK Pp.

Front flap: Absalom, Absalom!, which was first published in October 1936, is William Faulkner’s ninth novel. This Modern Library edition, available since 1951, was printed from plates reproduced photographically from the original edition, and includes the chronology of events in the novel, the genealogy of the principal characters, and the map entitled “Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha Co., Mississippi,” prepared by the “Sole Owner & Proprietor” for the first printing. (Fall 1963) The memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions fromSanctuaryandAbsalom, Absalom!was dated 14 November 1962 (RH box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’sLight in Augustwas also dropped around this time. Introductions appear to have been dropped when ML Faulkner titles began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was forLight in Augustin spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, includingAbsalom! Absalom!, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—Selected Short Stories,Intruder in the Dust,A Fable, andPylon, were new to the ML. Two,The Sound and the FuryandAs I Lay Dying, had previously been combined in a single ML volume (1946: 394). 434c.
