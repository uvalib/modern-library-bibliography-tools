(Spring 1951) Jacket:Pictorial in dark reddish orange (38) and black on cream paper with inset illustration of medallion with Greek woman in helmet holding a spear and wreath; author in reverse and other lettering in black, all on dark reddish orange background. Front flap: In the twenty-six years of his life, John Keats achieved permanent rank among the world’s greatest lyricists. His poetry, here offered in its entirety, includes a number of recently found verses hitherto unavailable in most collections. In addition, a generous representation of his letters in complete form throws light on the emotional life of the poet and the creative sources of his writing. Harold E. Briggs, Professor of English at the University of Southern California, contributes an illuminating introduction and provides an appendix of documents dealing with the damning of “Endymion” by the critics who were responsible for the crucial series of events at the end of Keats’s life. (Spring 1951) Original ML collection, printed from offset plates. Published spring 1951.WR9 June 1951. First ML printing: Not ascertained. Published spring 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. Briggs received a flat fee of $250 to prepare a Keats collection for MLCE (Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1950). In June 1951 Stein indicated that a decision had been made to include the volume in the regular ML as well. “When the contract was originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition . . . we could not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series, hoping thereby to retrieve a part of our investment” (Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1951). Stein sent Briggs an additional payment of $100 in recognition of the publication ofThe Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Keatsin the regular ML. The volume was printed from offset plates at a time when most ML titles were printed letterpress. Freiman was disappointed with the quality of the printing. When the first set of MLCE sheets arrived he told the ML’s printer that the quality was “very bad. I would not feel so sad about this were it not for the fact that these are printed from a new set of plates. Further, I have been impressed with the fine quality of printing the Rinehart editions enjoy” (Freiman to Richard Simon, Parkway Printing, 10 May 1951). MLCE had been created to compete with Rinehart Editions in the burgeoning college market. The text of the poems “is substantially that of the first editions. A number of emendations have been made as a result of collating later editions. . . . Some silent changes in punctuation, etc., have been made in the interest of greater clarity. The text of Keats’s letters . . . is reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press from Maurice Buxton Forman’sThe Letters of John Keats” (p. xxxv)."
