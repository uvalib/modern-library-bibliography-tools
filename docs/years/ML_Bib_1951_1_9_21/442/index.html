    "The nationwide revival of interest in the works of America’s pioneer realistic novelist prompts the editors of the Modern Library to make William Dean Howells’ most celebrated book available to contemporary readers. Written in 1885,The Rise of Silas Laphamwas then hailed as the first study of the native self-made businessman. It traced a new phenomenon in our national life during the years following the Civil War and portrayed the ferocity of the struggle for social recognition and acceptance. With the passage of more than a half century, this novel still reflects an era in America’s development and now offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on our national character. (Fall 1951)",

    "Cerf first expressed interest inThe Rise of Silas Laphamin 1937, when he asked if the ML could reprint it using the plates of Houghton, Mifflin’s Centenary Edition (Cerf to  Robert Linscott, Houghton, Mifflin, 18 October 1937). Linscott replied that it could not be released to the ML because Houghton, Mifflin had just published a new edition printed from new plates.",
    "Stein initially approached Alfred Kazin about writing the introduction, offering him $150 (Stein to Kazin, 26 June 1950). Kazin declined but expressed interest inCharterhouse of Parma; Stein indicated that if Stendhal’s novel were added to MLCE the introduction would be reserved for him (Stein to Kazin, 21 July 1950). He then asked Jacques Barzun, increasing the fee to $200. Barzun declined on the grounds that he was not equipped to do Howells justice (Stein to Barzun, 4 August 1950; Barzun to Stein, 9 August 1950). Stein succeeded on his third attempt. Clark received $200 for the introduction (Stein to Clark, 14 August 1950).",
    "The official publication date as indicated in review copies was 25 September 1951. Sheets of the first printing were not received for binding until 4 October, so copies were probably not ready for distribution until later in October.",

    "Written in 1885, Howells’ story of the rise of a newly rich, socially aspiring family is generally regarded as the pioneer novel of American realism. Rejecting the symbolism of Melville and Hawthorne, and the false sentimentality of popular novels, Howells defined realism as “nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material . . . fidelity to experience and probability of motive.” In this light, he examines the Laphams’ response to the ethical problems posed by economic expansion, their conflicts with an admired and resented Boston aristocracy, and, to give a balanced view of the Laphams’ world, delves into the fields of finance, architecture, and even the details of mineral paint production. This novel still reflects an era in America’s development and offers a sharp, pertinent commentary on our national character.",
