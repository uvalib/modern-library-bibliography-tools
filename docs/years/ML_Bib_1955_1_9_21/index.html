Beginning with Freud’s cornerstone formulations, theOutline of Psychoanalysispresents a clear and accurate picture of all the major developments in the field. Here the reader will find authoritative statements by Freud, Adler, Jung, Reich, Abraham, Sullivan, Horney, Alexander, and other distinguished figures too numerous to list.",
          "For an understanding of man’s nature and development, his goals and difficulties, his driving forces and defenses—for this and more, the reader will do well to know the substance of this book. (Spring 1955)",
          "Original ML anthology supersedingOutline of Psychoanalysis, edited by J. S. Van Teslaar (108). Published spring 1955.WR25 June 1955. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.",
          "The revision ofAn Outline of Psychoanalysis, originally published in 1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision ofAn Outline of Abnormal Psychology(172). Clara Thompson, Executive Director of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology, was recommended by Gardner Murphy shortly after he agreed to reviseAn Outline of Abnormal Psychology(Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953).",
          "Thompson and her fellow editors tried to present “the many approaches which go to make up a science such as psychoanalysis” (p. [ix]) but ran into major obstacles in securing permissions. W. W. Norton, the publisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to allow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton expressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the original editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not to have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to Stein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was disturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing (Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by these authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to include them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word.",
          "Anna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to appear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections by their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The Emotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.” Gitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative table of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by & large, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of psychoanalysis.” He continued:",
          "All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel, Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the standpoint from which I view it. . . .",
          "Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the “interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954).",
          "Anna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book,The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense. “My reason for this,” she wrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the other contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter would create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July 1954). Stein replied:",
          "In planning theOutline of Psychoanalysis, we have tried to represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to a proper view of psychoanalysis. The other category in the collection is controversial material. We have tried to present some impression of the differing viewpoints that now exist. . . . Consequently, many people who differ on a scientific basis with each other will appear in this volume without there being any suggestion that one is right and the other wrong.",
          "He offered to include a statement in the book “explaining that many different viewpoints are represented here and that the presence of any particular writer’s material . . . does not imply an endorsement of the views expressed by other writers in the book” (Stein to Freud, 8 July 1954). But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your arguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part” (Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954).",

Several of the sections have already achieved individual fame as separate stories, especially “The Bear,” which is one of the highest points in Mr. Faulkner’s achievement, and “The Fire and the Hearth,” which is a kind of prelude to his novel,Intruder in the Dust.

First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1959.",
          "The ML paid Coward-McCann a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Publishers were not enthusiastic about McCord’s title. An earlier reprint changed the title toThe Modern Treasury of Humorous Verse(Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition under its subtitle,An Anthology of American and British Humorous and Witty VersewithWhat Cheeras a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16 July 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave five years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he wrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . .What Cheeris short and sweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I wanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I think, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship (the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on to the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954).",
          "McCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he suggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of people, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could not be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if he really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as well without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included the new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.” Permission fees for the new verses came to $220.50; the costs for typesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new to the ML edition were $264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955).",
          "Fifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t setting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it has justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am proud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three years later he had to tell McCord thatWhat Cheerhad “dropped so far below our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the series. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as you know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this kind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959)."

Our world bears little outward relation to the one surveyed by Francis Bacon when, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, he issued his call for the advancement of learning through the method of inductive science. Yet it is precisely his spirit of scientific experimentation which has become the foundation of modern science and, therefore, of the modern world itself. It is then very worth our while to read this volume of Bacon’s greatest writings—theAdvancement of Learning, theNovum Organum, theNew Atlantisand the famousEssays, which show his keen insight into the practical problems of human conduct as well as his mastery of English prose. Professor Dick of the University of California has used various shorter pieces to link these major works and produce in one volume a coherent intellectual autobiography of a great mind.

An indifferent student in his youth, of law, medicine, and pedagogy, he became an honor graduate of the school of human weakness and suffering—for which the eighteenth century provided ample classrooms. When he finally turned to literature, his experiences were not expressed with the satirist’s biting ridicule but with the genuine warmth, humanity, and humor which have made him a beloved friend of generations of readers.
