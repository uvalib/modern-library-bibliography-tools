    "Few figures hold a firmer place in the affections of their readers than Oliver Goldsmith. The endearing qualities of his writings and of the man himself are the same—the simple charm of the essays fromThe Citizen of the World, the tenderness ofThe Vicar of Wakefield, the compassion ofThe Deserted Villageand other poems, the hilarity ofShe Stoops to Conquer. An indifferent student in his youth, of law, medicine, and pedagogy, he became an honor graduate of the school of human weakness and suffering—for which the eighteenth century provided ample classrooms. When he finally turned to literature, his experiences were not expressed with the satirist’s biting ridicule but with the genuine warmth, humanity, and humor which have made him a beloved friend of generations of readers. (Spring 1955)",
    "Original ML collection. Published June 1955.WR25 June 1955. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "Stein initially asked Katherine C. Balderston of Wellesley College to edit a Goldsmith volume for the ML, but she was too busy (Stein to Balderston, 19 May 1952). Some months later he contacted Hilles, who had written the introduction toThe Vicar of Wakefieldfor the American edition of Everyman’s Library in 1951 (Hilles to Stein, 23 February 1953). Hilles received a flat fee of $300 for his work on the volume.",
    "“The text of the present edition . . . is based on the earliest version of each selection. . . . Some of the additions which Goldsmith made at a later date have been included, but these are set off within square brackets. An attempt has been made to preserve the original spelling with all its inconsistencies, but obvious misprints have been silently corrected, and some of the long paragraphs in the early essays have been split up. Considerable liberty has been taken with such quirks of the printer as the use of italics, initial capital letters, and punctuation.” (Editorial Note, p. xxiii)"
