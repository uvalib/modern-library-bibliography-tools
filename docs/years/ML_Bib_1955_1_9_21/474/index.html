    "Originally published by Coward-McCann, 1945. ML edition (pp. [vii]–x, xxvii–515)printed from Coward-McCann plates with “Last Word First” (pp. xi–xxvi) added and table of contents and introduction repaginated. Published June 1955.WR25 June 1955. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1959.",
    "The ML paid Coward-McCann a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Publishers were not enthusiastic about McCord’s title. An earlier reprint changed the title toThe Modern Treasury of Humorous Verse(Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition under its subtitle,An Anthology of American and British Humorous and Witty VersewithWhat Cheeras a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16 July 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave five years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he wrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . .What Cheeris short and sweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I wanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I think, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship (the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on to the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954).",
    "McCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he suggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of people, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could not be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if he really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as well without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included the new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.” Permission fees for the new verses came to $220.50; the costs for typesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new to the ML edition were $264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955).",
    "Fifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t setting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it has justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am proud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three years later he had to tell McCord thatWhat Cheerhad “dropped so far below our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the series. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as you know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this kind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959)."
