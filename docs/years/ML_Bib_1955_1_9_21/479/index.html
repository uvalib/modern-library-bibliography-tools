    "People who know Dostoevsky only through such famous novels asThe Brothers KaramazovandCrime and Punishmentwill be surprised and delighted by this collection of stories. It shows Dostoevsky in a variety of moods—tender and romantic in “The White Nights,” satiric in “The Xmas Tree and a Wedding,” revealingly autobiographical in “The Peasant Marey,” pitilessly analytic in “Notes from the Underground,” one of the most significant and impressive things he ever wrote. These stories also show an artistry equal to, and in many ways even surpassing, that of the great novels, powerful and intense as they are.",
    "These brilliant modern translations by David Magarshack accomplish one of the most difficult tasks in the world—to transfer great literature to another language and still keep it indisputably great. (Fall 1955)",
    "Originally published by John Lehmann asA Gentle Creature and Other Stories(London, 1950). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1955.WR1 October 1955. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1979.",
    "Cerf had been interested for some time in publishing a collection of Dostoevsky’s stories in the ML (Linscott to Klopfer, 22 September 1954). Several collections, includingPoor Folk & The Gambler(Everyman’s Library, 1915),The Short Novels of Dostoevsky(Dial Press, 1945),The Short Stories of Dostoevsky, ed. William Phillips (Dial Press, 1946) were considered before Magarshack’s volume was selected. Stein offered Magarshack a flat fee of $500 to include his collection in the ML. Magarshack tried to negotiate a 10 percent royalty before accepting the offer (Stein to Magarshack, 3 January 1955). The ML re-titledMemoirs from a Dark Cellarto the more familiarNotes from the Undergroundand changed references to it in Magarshack’s introduction accordingly. The ML had U.S. rights and nonexclusive Canadian rights.",
    "The ML followed the usage of the Lehmann edition in transliterating the author’s name as “Dostoevsky.” All other ML editions of the author’s works used the spelling “Dostoyevsky.” In recent decades “Dostoevsky” has become the most common transliteration of the author’s name in English-language editions of his works. “Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821–1881” remains the “authorized form” used in library catalogs to collocate the nearly 50 variant spellings that have been used to represent the author’s name in the Roman alphabet.",
    "Sales totaled 15,905 copies by spring 1958.",
