    "We live today in a world made possible by modern science. Our world bears little outward relation to the one surveyed by Francis Bacon when, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, he issued his call for the advancement of learning through the method of inductive science. Yet it is precisely his spirit of scientific experimentation which has become the foundation of modern science and, therefore, of the modern world itself. It is then very worth our while to read this volume of Bacon’s greatest writings—theAdvancement of Learning, theNovum Organum, theNew Atlantisand the famousEssays, which show his keen insight into the practical problems of human conduct as well as his mastery of English prose. Professor Dick of the University of California has used various shorter pieces to link these major works and produce in one volume a coherent intellectual autobiography of a great mind. (Spring 1955)",

    "Francis R. Johnson of Stanford University was Stein’s first choice to editSelected Writings of Francis Bacon. Johnson was unable to accept and recommended Hugh G. Dick. Stein indicated when he contacted Dick, “We have long felt that we ought to include in the Modern Library a small volume of Francis Bacon’s writings. While we do not expect such a work to sell very widely, we do feel that there is enough need to warrant undertaking it” (Stein to Dick, 20 February 1953). Dick received a flat fee of $350 for his work on the volume.",
    "The ML edition was set from Bacon’sWorks, edited by James Spedding, R L. Ellis and D. D. Heath (7 vols., London, 1857–74)."
