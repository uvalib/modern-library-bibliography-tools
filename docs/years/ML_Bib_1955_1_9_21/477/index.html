    "The American theatre has rarely been as rich in achievement and promise as it is today. A brilliant group of new dramatists has come forward during the last few years, and their works—produced here and abroad—bear out the reputation of our stage as an alive, dynamic force. Six of the best plays by six of the finest new talents are included here: “A Streetcar Named Desire” by Tennessee Williams; “Death of a Salesman” by Arthur Miller; “The Seven Year Itch” by George Axelrod; “Come Back, Little Sheba” by William Inge; and “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial” by Herman Wouk. To read these is to share immediately the excitement of today’s American stage. (Fall 1955)",

    "Front flap:",
    "The post-World War II decade was one of excitement and experimentation in the American theatre. In a climate of political and emotional instability, new dramatists probed accepted values, and took as their material the agony of ordinary men and women whose emotions struggle blindly for fulfillment in a society no longer attuned to their needs.",
    "To dramatize the contrast between the interior and exterior lives of their characters, whether seen as an aspect of the tragic or comic, the playwrights represented in this collection broke out of the constrictions of traditional forms and methods, and brought to the American theatre a new moral relevance and depth.",
    "Included here are six of the best plays by six of the best talents of the period:A Streetcar Named Desireby Tennessee Williams;Death of a Salesmanby Arthur Miller;The Seven Year Itchby George Axelrod;Tea and Sympathyby Robert Anderson;Come Back Little Shebaby William Inge; andThe Caine Mutiny Court Martialby Herman Wouk."
