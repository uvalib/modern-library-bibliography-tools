    "Convinced that Fielding’sJoseph Andrewswill take its place in general popularity beside his universally readTom Jones(No. 185), the editors take pleasure in adding this immortal satire to the Modern Library series. Full-bodied, broadly humorous, this swift-paced classic is a biting commentary on the pretenses and foibles of eighteenth-century England, and is as fresh and vivid today as it was when written. It is doubtful if its array of characters has ever been surpassed in English fiction for brilliance, economy and variety. (Fall 1939)",

    "Cerf appears to have asked Henry C. Moriarty, manager of the book department of the Harvard Cooperative Society, to suggest someone to write the introduction. Moriarty suggested Howard Mumford Jones, a professor of English at Harvard. When Cerf contacted Jones he explained that the ML could “only pay $50 for forewords because of the small margin of profit on which the library is operated. On the other hand, there are no stipulations whatever as to the length of the foreword or contents thereof” (Cerf to Jones, 8 June 1939). Jones suggested George Sherwood of Columbia University as better qualified, but after a second letter from Cerf he agreed to write the introduction himself.",
    "The ML edition sold 2,823 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.",

    "Fielding himself describedJosephAndrewsas a satire “in imitation of the manner of Cervantes.” Its original purpose was to heap ridicule on the then popular romantic heroine of Samuel Richardson’sPamela. But the novel grew beyond its first intention and became more than a mere parody. In its own right it earned the status of one of the major works of fiction of the mid-eighteenth century and was the forerunner of Fielding’s masterpiece,Tom Jones(Modern Library No. 185). Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on the pretenses and follies of English society,Joseph Andrewsis a novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired. (Spring 1954)",
    "Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.",
    "WhenJoseph Andrewswas included on the first list of titles to be published in MLCE, Stein offered Jones $75 to add a bibliography and invited him to look over the introduction to see if he would like to make any changes (Stein to Jones, 27 January 1950). Jones made only a few small changes.",
