    "In the few years that have elapsed since the publication ofSeven Gothic Tales, it has established itself among discerning readers as a modern classic. In order to add an increasing number of admirers to those who have been acclaiming this book in its more expensive format, the editors of the Modern Library include it in the series. The felicity of writing, the charm and dramatic power of these tales, their dignity and beauty, create a spell for readers of every shade of interest. Dorothy Canfield contributes an illuminating introduction. (Spring 1939)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934, two years before the firm was acquired by Random House. ML edition (pp. v–420) printed from Smith and Haas/RH plates with decorative borders omitted from part title pages and part titles printed in black gothic type instead of red. Published April 1939.WR8 April 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Published in Vintage Books, September 1972; restored to ML, 1980.",
    "The 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format was used because the original plates were too large for the ML’s standard balloon cloth format. Even with the larger format the margins of the printed pages are uncomfortably narrow. The switch from letterpress to offset lithographic printing in the 1960s allowed the type page of 320c to be reduced photographically from 160 x 98 mm to 146 x 90 mm. This allowed larger margins, but the substantial reduction in type size made the text harder to read. A happy medium is achieved in 320d. The format is increased to 7½ x 4⅞ in., and the type page has been increased photographically to 155 x 88 mm. However, the volume is an early example of perfect binding rather than sewn, and it is not unusual to find copies today that are falling apart.",
    "The ML edition sold 7,154 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placingSeven Gothic Talesnear the top of the second quarter of ML titles during this 18-month period. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. In contrast, sales of Dinesen’sOut of Africa(447), published in the ML in April 1952, placed it near the top of the second quarter of ML sales for the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

    "Seven Gothic Taleswas an immediate sensation when it was first published in 1934, and there was much speculation about the author before it was revealed that “Isak Dinesen” was actually the Danish Baroness Blixen, who had written this, her first book, in English. Since then,Taleshas established itself as a classic. By using modern perceptions within the framework of the old Gothic tale, Baroness Blixen created, as one of her early critics wrote, “a book of unique atmosphere . . . a book bringing the psychological insight of a Henry James to the material of a Northern Boccaccio . . . a book of extraordinary fantasy that yet takes us intimately into a vivid variety of human lives.”",
