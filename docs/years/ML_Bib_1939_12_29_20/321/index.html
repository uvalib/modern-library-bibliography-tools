    "In the 1930’s the GroupTheatre made its presence felt with new plays, actors and writers who have since added great luster to the American stage. The most notable dramatist to emerge from that adventure in the theatre was Clifford Odets. In the Spring of 1935 his first play,Waiting for Lefty, was produced and it created a sensation, both as atour de forceand as a drama of substantial theme and sharply drawn character. Since that first production, Clifford Odets has extended his reputation with other plays of distinction. This volume includes the complete texts of the following plays:Waiting for Lefty,Awake and Sing,Till the Day I Die,Paradise Lost,Golden Boy, andRocket to the Moon. (Spring 1960)"
