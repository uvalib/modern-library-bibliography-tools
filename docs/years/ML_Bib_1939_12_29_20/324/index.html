    "Nothing could be more timely than a novel which re-affirms the nobility and integrity of the Jewish people. Such a novel isHear, Ye Sonsand it is revived at a moment when persecution of a defenseless minority is spreading all over the world. The most popular book by the author ofDoctor Addams, a national best-seller,Hear, Ye Sonsis a story recommended to readers of every taste and every racial and religious origin. It is a novel alive with the spirit of tolerance. (Fall 1939)",
    "Originally published by Longmans, Green & Co., 1933. ML edition (pp. [7], vii–306) printed from Longmans, Green plates. Published October 1939.WR14 October 1939. First (and only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1942.",
    "Ford Madox Ford wrote to the ML in 1933 praisingHear, Ye Sons, and Cerf may have told Fineman that he was interested in a ML edition. Fineman indicated in 1938 that reprint houses had been asking for the book for several years but that he had held off, hoping that it would appear in the ML. He added that if the ML did not want it he would let it go to another reprinter (Fineman to Cerf, 26 December 1938). Cerf replied two days later that he wanted to publishHear, Ye Sonsin fall 1939 and invited Fineman to write a new preface (Cerf to Fineman, 28 December 1939). “A Belated Preface” (pp. [i–v]) was written for the ML edition.",
    "The ML edition ofHear, Ye Sonssold poorly and was discontinued after two years and two-and-a-half months, making it the shortest-lived ML title. John Davidson,Poems(107), published by Boni & Liveright in April 1924 and discontinued at the end of 1926, outlastedHear, Ye Sonsby six months and was the second shortest-lived title."
