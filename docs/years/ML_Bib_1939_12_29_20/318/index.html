    "Captain Liddell Hart, whoseHistory of the World Warstill holds the field as the most brilliant analysis of the strategy and campaigns of that conflict, has now compressed the complete story into 285 pages, without the slightest sacrifice to accuracy or clarity. Read this little book—refresh your memory—and get a new insight into the present-day maneuvering of Europe’s war barons!",
    "Front flap:",
    "The complete story of the World War is here compressed into 285 pages by the greatest military authority of our time. Without the slightest sacrifice of accuracy or clarity, every campaign, every innovation, every change of leadership of the entire conflict on land and sea and in the air is covered completely. This volume is identical with the original edition and includes the unabridged text, with full maps.The War in Outlineis even more than a history; it is also a prophecy of what may happen during the war now threatening the world. (Spring 1939)",
    "Originally published by Random House, 1936. ML edition (pp. v–285) printed from RH plates with list of maps on p. [xvii] revised to reflect the omission of two folded maps and the use of a third map on the endpapers. Published February 1939.WR18 February 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1946.",
    "The War in Outlinewas an abridgment of Liddell Hart’sHistory of the World War, 1914–1918(Little, Brown, 1935), which was originally published in 1930 asThe Real War(Little, Brown, 1930). The abridgment reduced the text from 635 to 285 pages.",
    "When the RH edition ofThe War in Outlinewas published Cerf wrote to Eugene O’Neill, who had lent him an earlier book by Liddell Hart: “I was so deeply impressed by that book that I swore that one day we’d get something by Hart [sic] for Random House. This is one time anyhow that a dream came true!” (Cerf to O’Neill, 21 September 1936). \tCerf does not appear to have realized that Liddell Hart was a compound surname. The author’s forenames, Basil Henry, were omitted from the title pages of Random House and ML printings and also from the jacket, andThe War in Outlinewas entered under “Hart” in ML lists and catalogues.",
    "The ML edition sold 2,481 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it among the thirty worst-selling titles for that period. Random House offered to sell the plates to Liddell Hart after the ML edition was discontinued (Emanuel Harper to Liddell Hart, 31 October 1947).",
