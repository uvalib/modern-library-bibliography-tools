    "The turbulent life of Vincent Van Gogh is the basis for Irving Stone’s best-selling novel. Out of the misery of the painter’s struggle for existence and the magnificence he achieved in his art, there is woven his profoundly moving life-story. Van Gogh worked, fought and created with some of the most celebrated men of the century: Gauguin, Zola, Cezanne; and he lived with some of the most abject human beings of his time. In the pages ofLust for Life, Van Gogh is vindicated as man and artist. (Spring 1939)",
    "Originally published by Longmans, Green & Co., 1934. ML edition (pp. [v]–489) printed from Longmans, Green plates. Published February 1939.WR18 February 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "The Longmans, Green plates were too large for the ML’s 6½ by 4¼ inch format. To avoid resetting the text the ML the publishedLust for Lifein the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would become standard for ML books beginning in fall 1939.",
    "Lewis Miller, the RH sales manager, liked the larger format. He consideredLust for Lifethe most presentable book the ML had published, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also regarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and appearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar reprint published by Grosset & Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8 February 1939).",
    "The ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It sold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML titles. Adjusted for 18 months, 1951–52 sales exceed those for 1942–43 by fewer than 100 copies; the ranking ofLust for Lifein the third quarter of ML sales during 1942–43 reflects the increase in demand for books of all kinds during the Second World War.",
    "Pocket Books, Inc., publishedLust for Lifeas a 25-cent paperback in 1945. The film version of Stone’s novel starring Kirk Douglas, released in 1956, probably led to an increase in sales of the ML edition, but sales figures for the mid-1950s are not available.",
