Front flap: In the entire world of the theatre, the legend “by Kaufman and Hart” is the hallmark of themes so timely, workmanship so sure and dialogue so sparkling that it is small wonder that in their own field these collaborators are simply beyond competition. Besides the six plays, in complete and unabridged versions, this volume offers an intimate picture of George Kaufman by Moss Hart and an equally revealing portrait of Moss Hart by George Kaufman, plus a serious introduction by their friend and severest critic, Brooks Atkinson of theNew York Times. (Spring 1944) Originally published by Random House, 1942. ML edition (pp. [v]–586) printed from RH plates. Publication announced for February 1944.WR15 April 1944. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Six Playswas not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952."
