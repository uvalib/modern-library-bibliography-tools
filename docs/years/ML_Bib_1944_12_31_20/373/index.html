    "Front flap:",
    "Deep in the heart of every human being, no matter how rational or sceptical, there lurks a fascination for the weird and occult. Disbelief does not lay ghosts, nor do the tests of science exorcise them. Stairs creak in the dark with the tread of unseen visitors; cemeteries send up midnight apparitions; and headless horsemen ride in the moonlight.",
    "In this completely revised edition ofFamous Ghost Stories, Bennett Cerf has included such classics of the supernatural as “The Beckoning Fair One,” “The Willows,” “The Supper at Elsinore,” and “The Phantom Rickshaw.” (Fall 1944)",
    "Front flap reset with the following phrase added to the last sentence:",
    "“and many other tales of terror and ghostly phenomena.” (Fall 1959)",
    "Jacket B1:Fujita non-pictorial jacket in deep yellow (85), strong purplish red (255) and black on coated white paper; “Famous” in deep yellow, “Ghost” in reverse, “Stories” in strong purplish red, and other lettering in reverse.",
    "Front and back flaps:",
    "Perhaps no literary genre has as valid a claim to time-proven distinction as the ghost story; from the ages when men huddled around a fire and exchanged tales to hold back the night, to this day when science is beginning to probe the reaches of man’s mind, the ghost story has held a place of honorable speculation. Whether we scoff or believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling fascination.",
    "Bennett Cerf introduces this selection of notable ghost stories that reflect the best of the form. Included are such shiveringly famous tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home, Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human imagination.",
    "Original ML anthology supersedingBest Ghost Stories(67), which had been in the ML since 1919. Publication announced for spring 1944.WR5 August 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.",
    "Cerf commented inSRL: “Ever since I have had anything to do with the Modern Library, it has included one anthology which struck me as several degrees below par, and that is its collection of ghost stories. This summer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume. The first step in this process, duly recognized by the International Order of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb through all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of numerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library archives” (“Trade Winds,”SRL, 28 August 1943, p. 17).",
    "Eleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the anthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a flat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4 cents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy.",
    "Famous Ghost Stories(IML 17) was also published in the Illustrated Modern Library (1946) with illustrations by Hugo Steiner-Prag and William Sharp.",
