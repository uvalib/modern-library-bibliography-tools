Whether we scoff or believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling fascination."

Included are such shiveringly famous tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home, Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human imagination."

This summer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume. The first step in this process, duly recognized by the International Order of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb through all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of numerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library archives” (“Trade Winds,”SRL, 28 August 1943, p. 17)."
