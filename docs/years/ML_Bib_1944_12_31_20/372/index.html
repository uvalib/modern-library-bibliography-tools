    "Jacket:Non-pictorial in deep red (16) and black on cream paper with title and editor in reverse on deep red panel at upper left; background in cream with other lettering in black below panel. Front flap as 183b. (Spring 1944)",
    "Original ML anthology supersedingAnthology of American Negro Literature, ed. V. F. Calverton (183). Publication announced for spring 1944.WR16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1957.",
    "Watkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’sAnthology of American Negro Literature(1929) included short stories, selections from novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and autobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories, essays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection represents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s Negro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the Negro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind about his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp. xi–xii).",
    "For poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have been published in this field:Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro Poetry for Young Readers, by Arna Bontemps;Book of American Negro Poetry, by James Weldon Johnson;Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse by Negro Poets, by Countee Cullen;Negro Voices, An Anthology of Contemporary Verse, by Beatrice M. Murphy;Negro Poets and Their Poems, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from novels he recommends “that the following novels be read:Their Eyes Were Watching God, by Zora N. Hurston;Home to Harlem, by Claude McKay;The Blacker the Berry, by Wallace Thurman;My Lives and How I Lost Them, by Countee Cullen;These Low Grounds, by W. E. Turpin;Blood on the Forge, by William Attaway;Black Thunder, by Arna Bontemps;Native Son, by Richard Wright, andThe White Face, by Carl R. Offord” (p. xiii).",
    "Keneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably toThe Negro Caravan, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee (Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes thatThe Negro Caravanhas been highly influential in establishing a canon of African-American literature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that endures. He does not believe the same is true for theAnthology of American Negro Literature(1944). (Kinnamon, 1997)",
