    "In the more than eighty years since its first publication, Palgrave’sGolden Treasuryhas maintained itself as a classic in its field. The constant demand for this collection of songs and lyrics and the insistent requests forThe Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyámhave led the editors of the Modern Library to add the Fitzgerald masterpiece to the Palgrave anthology. The poet and compiler were contemporaries, and the works by which they will always be known appeared within two years of each other. This long-cherished volume is introduced by one of the foremost anthologists of our time, Louis Untermeyer. (Spring1944)",
