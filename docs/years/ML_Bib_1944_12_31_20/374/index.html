The original plates were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November 1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii)."
