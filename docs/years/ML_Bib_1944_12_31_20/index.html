In fall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the textbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated Modern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board requirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series while RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles, including those noted above, were also published under this arrangement. The ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several other publishers that had surplus paper."

We counted on doing the same this year. When the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire production schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944)."

Later that year the ML stopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued to appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to go out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The profit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants were paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML books, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length."

He offered an advance of $1,000 on the assumption that the ML would be able to print from Holt plates, but Sloan discovered that the plates had been melted as part of the war effort. Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with the plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that composition and plates would cost at least $500 and suggested reducing the advance from $1,000 to $750, to which Cerf agreed.
