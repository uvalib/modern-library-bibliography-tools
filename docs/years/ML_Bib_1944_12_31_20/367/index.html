Signed: W.S. [William Sharp]. Front flap: The Day family has become a part of our national tradition, and life without Father Day would be very nearly unthinkable. With him, it has been a joy, and sometimes even a trial, but always an enriching and heartwarming adventure.Life with Father, as a play, has broken records for continuous performances, and has established itself as a modern American classic. In book form, Clarence Day’s family album is aglow with the spirit of what all of us like best to remember of our own past. (Spring 1944) Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1935. ML edition (pp. [5], v–258) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for February 1944; published 17 March 1944.WR25 November 1944. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956. The ML paid Knopf a $6,000 advance of which $2,254 remained unearned in spring 1954. Sharp received $75 for the jacket. Freiman wrote him: “Our one regret is that we cannot afford to pay you a fee closer to the true value of your work” (R. A. Freiman to Sharp, 18 November 1943). Lindsay and Crouse, the authors of the Foreword, had written the play based on Day’s book. In November 1943 the play was beginning its fifth year on Broadway; it eventually ran over seven years to become the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway. Competing with the ML edition was a reprint edition published in 1943 by Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press."
