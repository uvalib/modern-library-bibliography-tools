    "For its humor and its seriousness of purposeA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Courtis generally considered one of the highest achievements among all of Mark Twain’s books. As satire, it deftly strikes its blows at the follies of two ages, and as a passionate expression for justice and freedom, it is a work which offers ever-new rewards for the reflective reader. The second volume by Mark Twain to be included in the series,A Connecticut Yankeetakes an honored place beside its predecessor, the Modern Library GiantTom SawyerandHuckleberry Finn(G-49). (Spring 1949)",
    "Originally published by Harper & Bros., 1889. ML edition (pp. [v]–450) printed from Harper plates. Published spring 1949.WR16 April 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "Cerf asked the director of sales and promotion at Harper’s if he thoughtA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Courtwould do well in the ML. He also wanted to know how many other reprint editions were on the market and whether Harper’s had plates in good condition that would fit the ML’s format (Cerf to William H. Rose, 20 September 1948). The reprint contract was dated 14 October 1948. The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 5 cents a copy. The royalties were essentially a plate rental sinceA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Courtwas in the public domain.",
