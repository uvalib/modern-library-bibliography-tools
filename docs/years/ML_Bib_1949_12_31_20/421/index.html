Signed: Galdone. Front flap: That violent and erratic husband, Henry the VIII, was a molder of history, a power-impelled dynast who influenced the destiny of England. Opportunist, bully and intriguer, political strategist and despot, self-appointed head of the national religion, executioner on a large scale, a man of insatiable lusts and uninhibited will, he ruthlessly dominated the country over which he reigned for thirty-eight years. Francis Hackett’s chronicle of his varied life and loves is a magnificent historical pageant and one of the most vivid and colorful biographies of modern times. (Fall 1949) Front flap revised: That violent and unpredictable monarch and husband, Henry the Eighth, was a power-driven despot who helped shape the destiny of England. Bully, opportunist, shrewd intriguer and political strategist, self-appointed head of the national religion, executioner on a large scale, a man of insatiable lusts and ruthless will, he dominated the country over which he reigned for thirty-eight years. Francis Hackett’s chronicle of his erratic life and many loves is a historical pageant of stirring events and colorful personalities. It is generally acknowledged to be one of the most vivid biographies of modern times.(Spring 1959) Originally published asHenrythe Eighthby Horace Liveright, 1929. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with illustrations omitted. Published fall 1949.WR10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. The ML paid Liveright a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. The Liveright plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML had to reset the text and make new plates. The ML’s typesetting was made from a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he indicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March 1949). The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates became the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against royalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed nothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties were due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition passed 30,000 copies. Hackett received $750 from Liveright when the ML edition was published and nothing thereafter. Arthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930 lived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American publishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of his own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the $2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that the ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random House he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in December 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies, leaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20. The ML had paid nothing to Liveright since the initial advance in 1949 (Hiram Haydn to Hackett, 22 December 1958).",
