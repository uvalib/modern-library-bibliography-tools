To Catholic readers it goes to the heart of their faith and to more and more Protestants it has become the book by which sectarian differences can be resolved. By both it is acknowledged a literary masterpiece. Included in every list of great books for students and general readers,The Confessions, complete and unabridged in the E. B. Pusey translation and with a stirring Introduction by Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, now takes a proud and permanent place in the Modern Library series. (Spring 1949)"

      "#text": "The Pusey translation, originally published in 1838, appears to have been recommended by Sheen. The ML’s spring 1949 catalog announcedThe Confessions of Saint Augustinein the J. G. Pilkington translation, but Commins asked Sheen to indicate which of the two translations he preferred (Commins to Sheen, 16 November 1948). Cerf believed that the imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked Sheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen did not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would affect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to contact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949). The Church approved the introduction but declined to give an imprimatur since Pusey was not a Catholic and his translation had not been submitted to the censor."
