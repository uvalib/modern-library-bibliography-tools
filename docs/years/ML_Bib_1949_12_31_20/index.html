        "The postwar history of the Modern Library can be regarded as dating from the beginning of 1949. That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two major developments:  the continuing expansion and consolidation of the paperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that increased the importance of the college market.",
        "Cerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning.  He tried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in paperback Pocket Book editions.  When the ML had exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing them. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books to publish two titles that deGraff wanted:  Vincent Sheean’sPersonal History, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving Stone’sLust for Life, which had been in the ML for less than a year.",
        "Often the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works. The terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances in which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset & Dunlap or other hardbound reprint edition.  Even if the ML had exclusive reprint rights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year intervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release paperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from the ML when the contract expired.",
        "Before the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback editions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier by the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously affect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality paperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library Paperbacks.",
        "Random House responded to growth in the college market for quality books earlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950 under the direction of Jess Stein."

Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single-color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold."

The general neglect of it, hitherto, is a shame” (Zabel to Jess Stein, 31 October 1949). Stein forwarded the suggestion to Cerf, but the general consensus was that there was insufficient demand to justify a ML edition."

          "For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a volume that would include within 700 [±its more than 600] pages the representative lyrical writings of the classic Roman poets. With this book that need is now fulfilled. It includes the widest possible variety of odes, satires, eclogues, elegies and epigrams that have come down the centuries from such poets as Catullus, Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, Seneca, Juvenal, Martial and others. The translations by many skilled hands are the best obtainable, and the Introduction by F. R. B. Godolphin brilliantly interprets the poets and the verse of antiquity. (Spring 1949; [Spring 1959])",

The Pound translations were not used. Sales totaled 20,098 copies by spring 1958.",

By both it is acknowledged a literary masterpiece. Included in every list of great books for students and general readers,The Confessions, complete and unabridged in the E. B.

Cerf believed that the imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked Sheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen did not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would affect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to contact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949).

          "To bring within the compass of one volume the best of the essays written by Michel de Montaigne in a translation that is both faithful and modern has long been the aim of the editors of this series. The existing English renderings are either so archaic or are sometimes so colloquial as to lose some of the original nuances of meaning. Accordingly, with the William Hazlitt [Charles Cotton–W. C. Hazlitt] translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and modernized collection in language that retains the substance and conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay form. (Fall 1949; [Spring 1956])",
          "Original ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published fall 1949.WR10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.",
          "Montaigne’sEssayshad been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first in the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation, and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947). He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged. The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United States. Because there was some question of British rights, we voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29 September 1947).",
          "Bates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century translation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the public domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the original and to give the best possible modern rendering.”",
          "Bates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt translation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the Editor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised it, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to the accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to modernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the translation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]). Bates did not consider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement “completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of the title page be omitted.",
          "The manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have been delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his editorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.",
          "Bates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included the essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion of sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain in language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one of the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and quotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed. If you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to Commins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in fact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or, if included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).",

          "In 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern Library College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.",
          "Stein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s translation of Montaigne’sComplete Works:Essays, Travel Journal, Letters(Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3 November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion. If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’sComplete Essaysin 1958, may not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.",

A sixteen-canto epic satire in ottava rima, it recounts the seductions and betrayals, mishaps and adventures of the rakish Spanish grandee. Byron’s “plan was to have no plan” but to “unpack his heart” in the person of his hero. By his own account he meant to be “quietly facetious about everything,” and he used the epic to satirize English life, customs, manners and morals. But beneath the satiric impulse was a hatred of hypocrisy and a consciousness of the power of illusion. IfChilde Harold, as Louis Kronenberger remarks in his introduction, “is in large part Byronism,Don Juan“is Byron.” Romantic, irreverent, exuberant and entertaining, it is a “hymn to the earth,” but also a human sequence to “its own music chaunted.”",

          "“The tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains” undertaken by Francis Parkman in 1846 became a journey of research and brought forth, three years later, one of the permanent historical records of American expansion. At first hand Parkman gathered from Sioux Indians, hunters and trappers the material which was to makeThe Oregon Trailas much a tale of adventure as an authentic chronicle of the frontier. Exactly a century after its first publication, it takes its place in the Modern Library series, introduced by a distinguished contemporary historian, Henry Steele Commager. (Fall 1949)",

          "The Oregon Trailwas originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received $2,000 for the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page drawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of the chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were to be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21 January 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for bothThe Oregon Trailand Alcott’sLittle Women, the other Illustrated Modern Library title announced for fall 1947.",
          "At this point the type forThe Oregon Trailwas in galleys and the plates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publishThe Oregon Trailwithout illustrations in the regular ML.Little Women(431) was added to the regular series the following year.",
          "The jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss made for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the introduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote him about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume was at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29 June 1949)."

          "Starrett declined the ML’s invitation to reviseFourteen Great Detective Stories(1928: 155), citing lack of time, the “wildly inadequate” fee offered, and his lack of sympathy with the hard-boiled genre which he thought should be represented (Starrett to Maule, 28 July 1946). The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond Chandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo to Cerf, 23 September 1946).",
          "Haycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight. In his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in detective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the growth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely imitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection was available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has excelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that the hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and distinct form” (p. xii).",
