Oxford University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation, and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947). He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged. The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United States. Because there was some question of British rights, we voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29 September 1947)."

He did not consider it comparable in modernity or readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the original and to give the best possible modern rendering.”"

His intent has been to let the text stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]).

The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates became the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against royalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed nothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties were due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition passed 30,000 copies.

Pell told Hackett in 1954 that the ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random House he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in December 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies, leaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20. The ML had paid nothing to Liveright since the initial advance in 1949 (Hiram Haydn to Hackett, 22 December 1958)."

Unfortunately, no Hammett selection was available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has excelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that the hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and distinct form” (p. xii)."
