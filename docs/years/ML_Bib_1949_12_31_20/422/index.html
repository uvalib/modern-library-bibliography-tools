Front and back flaps: This Modern Library edition offers a basic selection of Immanuel Kant’s writings on the metaphysics of morality and politics. Here, a series of lucid translations enables the reader to appreciate Kant’s towering importance as an ethical and social thinker and to understand his enduring influence on the shape of philosophy. The twelve essays in this volume have been carefully arranged by Professor Carl J. Friedrich to represent the range of Kant’s most essential writings. Professor Friedrich has contributed an original essay for this volume in the form of a brilliant interpretive Introduction which places Kant, the philosopher and the man, in his time and timelessness. A note about Kant’s special relevance today: “Indeed, the problem of freedom, the freedom of the human personality to unfold and fulfill its higher destiny, is the central issue of all of Kant’s philosophizing” —from the Introduction. (Spring 1967format) ML original collection. Published December 1949.WR21 January 1950. First printing: Not ascertained. Friedrich received a $750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy. At first he planned to include selections fromCritique of Pure Reasonbut wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly as I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very unsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure Reason.” He suggested omittingCritique of Pure Reasonaltogether and including fuller extracts from theProlegomena(Friedrich to Commins, 14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page selection from the Introduction toCritique of Pure Reasonwas included. The ML published an abridged edition ofCritique of Pure Reasonin 1958 (506). Friedrich wrote Commins that he thought thatThe Philosophy of Kantwas a misleading title since large parts of theCritiquewere not included. He suggested calling the bookIntroduction to KantorKant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy(Friedrich to Commins, 20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had already been announced. He argued thatThe Philosophy of Kantdid not misrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but he offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to Friedrich, 25 July 1949). When he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest editor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12 October 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).
