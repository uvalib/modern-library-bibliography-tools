(Fall 1949) Original ML anthology supersedingFourteen Great Detective Stories, ed. Vincent Starrett (1928). Published December 1949.WR14 January 1950. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Starrett declined the ML’s invitation to reviseFourteen Great Detective Stories(1928: 155), citing lack of time, the “wildly inadequate” fee offered, and his lack of sympathy with the hard-boiled genre which he thought should be represented (Starrett to Maule, 28 July 1946). The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond Chandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo to Cerf, 23 September 1946). Haycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight. In his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in detective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the growth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely imitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection was available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has excelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that the hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and distinct form” (p. xii). Also in the Modern Library Fourteen Great Detective Stories, ed. Vincent Starrett (1928)  155"
