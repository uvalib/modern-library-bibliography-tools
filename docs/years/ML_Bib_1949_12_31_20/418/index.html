Front flap: The three sensitively told short novels—“Noon Wine,” “Old Mortality,” and the title story—are among the most clearly conceived and exquisitely wrought brief narratives in American fiction. A writer of few books, each one an ornament to English letters, Katherine Anne Porter has achieved and maintained an illustrious position among her contemporaries.Pale Horse, Pale Riderconfirms and extends the reputation earned byFlowering Judas. This second of her three distinguished books,Pale Horse, Pale Rider, richly deserves a permanent place in the Modern Library series.

Front flap as jacket A with last two sentences omitted. Originally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1939. ML edition (pp. [5]–264) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1949.WR1 October 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Pale Horse, Pale Riderwas the first Harcourt, Brace title added to the ML after Harcourt, Brace served notice in 1948 that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for nine of its titles, including Porter’sFlowering Judas and Other Stories(1940: 333) and works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf, so they could be included in its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics. Harcourt, Brace was reluctant at first to allowPale Horse, Pale Riderinto the ML and offered Porter’sThe Leaning Towerinstead. It then decided, perhaps as a peace offering, that the ML could have the earlier work (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to Cerf, 3 December 1948). Flowering Judas and Other Storiesnever appeared in Harbrace Modern Classics and was restored to the ML in 1953. Also in the Modern Library Porter,Flowering Judas and Other Stories(1940)  333"
