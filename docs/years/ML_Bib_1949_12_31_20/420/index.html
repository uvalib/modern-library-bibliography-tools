    "Now, a century and a quarter afterDon Juanwas written, Lord Byron’s glowing narrative poem continues to exercise an undiminished appeal for readers of the widest variety of tastes. The young have turned to it, generation after generation, for the fullest expression of the romantic mood and gesture. This at once romantic and irreverent tale is cherished by people of all ages for its excitement as story, for its passion, its lyric felicity, its impudent satire and its lively wit.Don Juan, the first of Byron’s works to be included in the Modern Library series, is introduced, brilliantly and perceptively, by Louis Kronenberger. (Fall 1949)",

Each new piece you do for us is another best” (Commins to Kronenberger, 1 July 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton University Library).",

    "Based on the old Spanish saga familiar to us through Mozart and Molière,Don Juanis Byron’s acknowledged masterpiece. A sixteen-canto epic satire in ottava rima, it recounts the seductions and betrayals, mishaps and adventures of the rakish Spanish grandee. Byron’s “plan was to have no plan” but to “unpack his heart” in the person of his hero. By his own account he meant to be “quietly facetious about everything,” and he used the epic to satirize English life, customs, manners and morals. But beneath the satiric impulse was a hatred of hypocrisy and a consciousness of the power of illusion. IfChilde Harold, as Louis Kronenberger remarks in his introduction, “is in large part Byronism,Don Juan“is Byron.” Romantic, irreverent, exuberant and entertaining, it is a “hymn to the earth,” but also a human sequence to “its own music chaunted.”",
    "“There is something for us to learn from the courage and buoyancy with which Byron came to terms with a world as shabby and confused as ours.”  —Dame Helen Gardner",
