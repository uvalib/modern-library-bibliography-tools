    "“The tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains” undertaken by Francis Parkman in 1846 became a journey of research and brought forth, three years later, one of the permanent historical records of American expansion. At first hand Parkman gathered from Sioux Indians, hunters and trappers the material which was to makeThe Oregon Trailas much a tale of adventure as an authentic chronicle of the frontier. Exactly a century after its first publication, it takes its place in the Modern Library series, introduced by a distinguished contemporary historian, Henry Steele Commager. (Fall 1949)",
    "ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for fall 1949.WR11 February 1950. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.",
    "The Oregon Trailwas originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received $2,000 for the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page drawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of the chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were to be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21 January 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for bothThe Oregon Trailand Alcott’sLittle Women, the other Illustrated Modern Library title announced for fall 1947.",
    "At this point the type forThe Oregon Trailwas in galleys and the plates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publishThe Oregon Trailwithout illustrations in the regular ML.Little Women(431) was added to the regular series the following year.",
    "The jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss made for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the introduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote him about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume was at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29 June 1949)."
