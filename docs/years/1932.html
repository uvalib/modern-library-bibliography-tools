<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1932</h1>
<h2>1932</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Elmer Adler, who had been a director of Random House since the imprint
was created in 1927 to distribute and publish fine limited editions,
resigned in 1932. Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine
printing business, Pynson Printers, and to <em>The Colophon</em>, the
bibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random
House was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library,
Inc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933,
following the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer
turned seriously to trade publishing.</p>
<p>ML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide
exceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes
published in 1932 sold for $1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages
per volume.</p>
<p>The ML published a full-page ad in <em>Publishers’ Weekly</em> that lampooned
the publishing industry adage, “You can’t sell books like soap.”
Adapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed “They
Float!” and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with
five Modern Library books—<em>Of Human Bondage</em>, <em>Swann’s Way</em>, <em>The Magic
Mountain</em>, <em>Droll Stories</em>, and <em>Sanctuary</em>—floating on the surface of
the water (<em>PW</em>, 14 May 1932, p. 2015).</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Twenty-four titles were added and fifteen were discontinued, bringing
the number of titles in the regular ML to 207. Six of the discontinued
titles (two by Maupassant and four by Wilde) were repackaged as three
volumes to offer better value. Chekhov, <em>Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other
Stories</em>, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more
comprehensive collection, <em>The Stories of Anton Tchekov</em>, edited by
Robert Linscott). Three new titles in ML Giants, including Gibbon,
<em>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> in two volumes, brought the
number of Giants to six titles in seven volumes. <em>Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire</em> was expanded to three volumes in 1946.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles except Dreiser, <em>Sister Carrie</em> (230) were published in
the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110
mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). <em>Sister
Carrie</em> was ¼ in. taller.</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type; all but three had <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>.
Dostoyevsky, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (228) had <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/A3.webp'>torchbearer A3</uvalib-modal-image-button>; Dos
Passos, <em>Three Soldiers</em> (248) had <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/C1.webp'>torchbearer C1</uvalib-modal-image-button>; <em>The Arabian Nights’
Entertainments</em> (244) had no torchbearer on the title page. All new
titles except <em>The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments</em> had the 3-line
imprint that began to be used in January 1931:</p>
<p>BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER</p>
<p>T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y</p>
<p>NEW YORK</p>
<p>The title page of <em>The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments</em> had so much text
that there was no room for a torchbearer or Cerf and Klopfer’s names.</p>
<p>The imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line
format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing
firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and
Klopfer as partners.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped
in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold
above the 2-line imprint on the spine.</p>
<p>Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,
blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all
four bindings.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange
endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930
through spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were
published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles
beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was
introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s
torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books
and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>Eighteen of the 1932 titles were published in individually designed
pictorial jackets. Four were published in uniform typographic jacket D
and two in uniform typographic jacket F. Nearly all new titles published
between 1932 and the introduction of the ML’s larger format in fall 1939
had pictorial jackets. Uniform typographic jacket D was used on newly
published titles for the last time in spring 1932. The final examples of
its use, <em>Poems of Longfellow</em> (235) and Franklin, <em>Autobiography and
Selections from His Other Writings</em> (236), provoked an angry letter from
Cerf, who had apparently given instructions that the jacket was no
longer to be used for new titles.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Dreiser, <em>Sister Carrie</em> xDickens, <em>Pickwick Papers</em>; Giants
through G5. (Fall) Dickens, <em>Pickwick Papers</em> xLewis, <em>Arrowsmith</em>;
Giants through G7.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf approached Arthur Pell at Liveright, Inc., about including a volume
of plays by Eugene O’Neill in ML Giants (Cerf to Pell, 16 November
1932). Nothing came of this initiative. O’Neill became a Random House
author the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O’Neill’s
<em>Nine Plays</em> (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added
to the Giants in 1941.</p>
<p>After repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens’s <em>Crock
of Gold</em> (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs,
the president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the
president of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML
reprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, “We
are simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a
cheap edition we would do it ourselves” (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).</p>
<p>Cerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge
plays, saying “If we can’t get this from you by peaceable means in the
next two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston
underworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with
lighted matches until you sign on the dotted line” (Cerf to Schaff, 16
November 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to
<em>Kim</em> (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to
consider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.</p>
<p>James Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,
suggested Edmund Wilson’s <em>Axel’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative
Literature of 1870–1930</em>, which had been published by Charles Scribner’s
Sons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with
Wilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested
adding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed
publishing under a new title such as <em>Literary Essays</em> or <em>Essays on
Modern Authors</em>. He also asked for an advance of $500 (Wilson to Cerf,
28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays
he had considered adding to <em>Axel’s Castle</em> into a new book (Wilson to
Cerf, 6 November 1933).</p>
<p>Dale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a
one-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm
of Albert &amp; Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes
comprising Proust’s <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>, would welcome some
ready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in
1930, and the firm “was in major trouble” by the early 1930s (“Albert
and Charles Boni” in <em>American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980</em>,
p. 57).</p>
<p>The ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, <em>Swann’s Way</em> (1928)
and <em>Within a Budding Grove</em> (1930), and would add <em>Guermantes Way</em> in
1933. Cerf thought that Warren’s suggestion was an excellent idea except
from the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked
Warren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris
Greenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. “We
have had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire
Proust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might
be able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that
anything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as
possible. Something <u>must</u> break in this situation before the
summer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining
in original). Five months later he indicated, “I have not given up hopes
of buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything
develops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you
immediately” (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure
<em>Remembrance of Things Past</em> a year or so later. The Random House
edition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf
described it as “one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934” (Cerf,
<em>At Random</em>, p. 99).</p>
<p>Warren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of
Proust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but
added that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust
if the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather’s <em>My Antonia</em>,
which he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to
Warren, 13 September 1943).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the whole literature of the subtle and mysterious relationship
between man and the crimes he commits, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> stands
supreme for its insight, its compassion and its psychological
fidelity. The story of the murder committed by Raskolnikov, his
punishment and atonement, is the most gripping and illuminating study
ever written of a crime of repugnance and despair, and the
consequences which arise inevitably from it. In Dostoyevsky’s mind,
crime is its own punishment and retributive justice can never be as
severe as the penalty the human soul can impose on itself. (<em>Spring
1935</em>)</p>

The ML invited Harry Levin and then Lionel Trilling to write the
introduction. Both declined on the grounds that the $200 fee offered was
inadequate (Erskine to Levin, 26 January 1950; Stein to Trilling, 3
February 1950; Trilling to Stein, 5 February 1950). At that point Stein
telephoned Simmons, who had just accepted an invitation to write an
introduction to <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> for $200, and he agreed to do
<em>Crime and Punishment</em> instead.<strong>228.3a. Text reset; offset printing (c.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The reader who takes up this book for the first time has in store for
him one of the rarest thrills that can be afforded by modern
literature. The editors of the Modern Library unhesitatingly list it
among the greatest novels of all time. That it ranks as one of the
five best sellers in the entire series is a tribute to the taste of
the American public. That the author is now in exile from his native
land is a commentary on the Hitler regime that needs no amplification.
(<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by
Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>]–900) printed from Knopf
plates with table of contents consolidated from vols. 1 and 2, fly title
omitted, and page numeral “xi” removed from the foreword. Published
January 1932. <em>WR</em> 13 February 1932. First printing: 17,000 copies.
Discontinued spring 1938.</p>
<p>Cerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of <em>The Magic Mountain</em> in
1929, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather
than the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have
to be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint
contract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf
did not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the
standard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years
(Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have
not been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12
cents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the
end the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular
printers.</p>
<p>Sales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883
copies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies
(1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).</p>
<p>Knopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year
term. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC
MOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will
be a $3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more
revenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have
the book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada,
18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in
October 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint
contract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a
large final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his
appreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your
attitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot
of things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf
to Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.</p>
<p>Cerf never accepted the loss of <em>The Magic Mountain</em> and tried
repeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical.
In 1942, after Mann’s <em>Buddenbrooks</em> (285) had also been withdrawn from
the ML, Cerf offered a $5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a
copy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you”
for permission to publish <em>The Magic Mountain</em> as a Giant. He added,
“Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know
why this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back
than any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July
1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is
just too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on
any arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the
necessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied:
“I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC
MOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow
<em>Buddenbrooks</em> into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann
title somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent
the best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).</p>
<p><em>The Magic Mountain</em> was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s
acquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML
in 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The story of the vicissitudes attendant upon the publisher’s
suppression, in 1901, of <em>Sister Carrie</em> is the history of America’s
emergence from the fog of suspicion and fear of realism in the novel.
On the score of his uncompromising fight, Theodore Dreiser must be
regarded a pioneer and liberator. His <em>Sister Carrie</em> pointed the
tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it
remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy,
tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown
internationally famous. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired
the Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W.
Dodge &amp; Co., 1907; Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1908; Harper &amp; Bros., 1912; and
Boni &amp; Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. [<em>1</em>]–557) printed from
Dreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1932. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Dreiser’s account of the original publication of <em>Sister Carrie</em>, “The
Early Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it
was rejected by Harper &amp; Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday,
Page at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a
reader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its
frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and
because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be
withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in
circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that
the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to
insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal
adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his
share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was
legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a
contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include
<em>selling</em>; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in
the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because
no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did
manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred
of them. (p. vi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html">James L. W. West
III</a>
notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a
vacation and read <em>Sister Carrie</em> in typescript. Perhaps his wife read
the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For
whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the
narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish
it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw
the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication.
Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed
to putting <em>Sister Carrie</em> into print, but that he was under no
obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and
Publication of <em>Sister Carrie</em>”, Dreiser Web Source, University of
Pennsylvania Library, 2000).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of <em>Sister Carrie</em> and left 450
unbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. <em>Sister Carrie</em> sold 456
copies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and
Dreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates
that the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies
of <em>Sister Carrie</em> were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &amp;
Company (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later
purchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of <em>Sister
Carrie</em>, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.</p>
<p>The ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a
$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the
advance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates
which had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited
to Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML
edition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.
Dreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing
was required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions
for the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s
death the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser
Papers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).</p>
<p>Dreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was
originally published in <em>The Colophon</em>, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s
Note on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern
Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as
much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and
spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser,
however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements
covering the two-fifty edition [the trade edition published by Boni &amp;
Liveright in 1917], and it was only in February, 1932, after more
attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us
do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sister Carrie</em> was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the
1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies
by the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of
$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). <em>Sister Carrie</em> sold 5,637 copies
during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the
second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in
the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

<p>The history of the vicissitudes attending upon the suppression, in
1901, of <em>Sister Carrie</em> is part of the history of America’s emergence
from the then prevailing atmosphere of prudery and suspicion. Fear of
realism in the novel prompted the campaign against writers who dared
challenge the romantic tradition. On the score of his uncompromising
fight against censorship and for the new and rising school of American
naturalism, Theodore Dreiser earned the right to be regarded as a
pioneer and liberator. His <em>Sister Carrie</em> was the forerunner of a
tendency in American fiction for at least a quarter of a century and
even today it remains a monumental achievement as a novel of great
sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness. For these qualities
alone Theodore Dreiser became internationally famous. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, McClure &amp; Co., 1899. ML
edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new
typesetting; the plates appear to have been made for the ML’s exclusive
use. Published February 1932. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1932. First printing: 5,000
copies. Discontinued 1990. <em>Dracula</em> was one of eleven Sun Dial Library
titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday
series in 1930. <em>Dracula</em> had been the Sun Dial Library’s best-selling
title with total sales of 10,953 copies to February 1930.</p>
<p>The plates for <em>Dracula</em>, along with new plates for Maugham’s <em>Of Human
Bondage</em> (199) and Bennett’s <em>Old Wives’ Tale</em> (207), were ready in July
1930 (Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 14 July 1930). The ML paid Doubleday,
Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Klopfer suggested a reduction in the
royalty rate after <em>Dracula</em> entered the public domain but indicated
that the ML would agree to whatever Doubleday decided (Klopfer to Mina
Turner, Doubleday, 17 April 1958). By 1965 the ML was paying royalties
of 5 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Dracula</em> sold 5,052 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular

D. Jacket title: THE SHORT STORIES OF ANTON TCHEKOV. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. <em>WR</em> 9
April 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. <em>The Stories of Anton
Tchekov</em> superseded Chekhov’s <em>Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories</em>
(27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision
of the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been
awaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short
Stories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to
scrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection
that we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected
with due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the
fourteen stories in <em>Rothschild’s Fiddle</em> were retained in Linscott’s
collection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).</p>
<p>The ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the
spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use
of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to <em>The Plays of Anton
Tchekov</em> (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of
that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to
“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of <em>Best Plays</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Stories of Anton Tchekov</em> sold 5,642 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth
of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.**232b. <em>Rothschild’s

Supreme among the world’s short-story writers, Anton Tchekov is here
represented by twenty-two [<em>sic</em>] of his most characteristic tales.
For their range and variety, for their acuteness of observation and
for their simple humanity, these stories reveal the fullest powers of
his genius. Tchekov’s unfailing insight into the lives of ordinary
people, his ability to dramatize the most commonplace situations and
his gentle humor made him not only one of the greatest of short-story
writers but also one of the most beloved. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

(<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Jonathan Cape &amp; Harrison Smith, 1931. ML edition
(pp. 1–380) printed from Cape &amp; Smith plates. Published March 1932. <em>WR</em>
26 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.
Published in Vintage Books, spring 1967.</p>
<p>Cerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the
ML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your
Modern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to
take with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE
FURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the
time the book was published, in your list [Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,
<em>On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,</em> was published by Cape &amp;
Smith in 1929]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will
be a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us
up.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few
volumes. He requested Joyce’s <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
and any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books
in which a Dostoyefsky [<em>sic</em>] influence was found. I have never read
Dostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf,
15 April 1931).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> or <em>As I Lay
Dying</em>, but Cape &amp; Smith had printed both novels from standing type
which had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s
audience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the
cost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in
production and design at Cape &amp; Smith, Smith &amp; Haas, and Random House
between 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for
books without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was
cheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the
possibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year
or so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be
instructed to melt the type (Harter, <em>The Making of William Faulkner’s
Books, 1929</em>–<em>1939</em>, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult
for reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive
reprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial
publication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from
the original publisher’s plates.</p>
<p>Faulkner’s next book, <em>Sanctuary</em>, had more commercial appeal. It was
the only Faulkner title published by Cape &amp; Smith for which plates were
made. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback.
The American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet
Books—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight
printings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies
(Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on
front cover).</p>
<p>In his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he
initially wrote <em>Sanctuary</em> for money. The introduction begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea,
because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been
writing books for about five years, which got published but not
bought. . . .</p>
<p>Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in
terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of
it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in
Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought
was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could
imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job
working the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between
12 and 4, I wrote <em>As I Lay Dying</em> in six weeks, without changing a
word. I sent it to Smith [his publisher] and wrote him that by it I
would stand or fall.” He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I had forgotten about <em>Sanctuary</em>, just as you might forget
about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.
<em>As I Lay Dying</em> was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of
<em>Sanctuary</em> until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so
terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite
it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy
it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been
already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting
it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame <em>The
Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> too much and I made a fair
job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they
will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than
the rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be
reset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees
Book Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the
introduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like
Burck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when
E. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger
format.</p>
<p>Faulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith &amp;
Haas. <em>Sanctuary</em> remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when
<em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> (394) were published together
in a single volume.</p>
<p><em>Sanctuary</em> sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.
Faulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel
Prize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the
series. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in
terms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952. <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> was the fifth
best-selling title in the regular ML, followed by <em>Light in August</em>
(429), <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (434), and <em>Sanctuary</em> (233), which sold
4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in
the regular ML.</p>

The sinister and depraved figure of Popeye dominates as extraordinary

is a story-teller’s <em>tour de force</em>, a tense and impassioned narration
of a horrific aspect of life that only the vigorous and the
healthy–minded can bear without wincing. It is a virile, challenging
novel that cannot be ignored or set aside. <em>Sanctuary</em> arouses the
most extreme enthusiasm or revulsion; it holds spellbound its most
ardent admirers and bitterest foes from first sentence to last. (<em>Fall
1933</em>)</p>

This celebrated book, the sixth of William Faulkner’s novels in order
of publication, first appeared on February 9, 1931, but a draft of the
manuscript had been finished nearly two years earlier. When Mr.
Faulkner saw the galley proofs of that version of <em>Sanctuary</em>, he felt
“that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it.”</p>
<p>He chose the latter course and did a thorough revision of the book,
cutting some sections entirely and adding new ones, rewriting other
sections in whole or in part, and rearranging the order of the
narration. He thus succeeded in making it a book which “would not
shame . . . too much,” as he put it, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As
I Lay Dying</em>, which had been published in the two preceding years.

<p>The memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from
<em>Sanctuary</em> and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> was dated 14 November 1962 (Box 538,
ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s <em>Light in August</em>
was also dropped around this time. The earliest printing of <em>Sanctuary</em>
without the introduction was in 1963 or 1964. Introductions appear to
have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in
uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of
the uniform Faulkner jacket was for <em>Light in August</em> in spring 1963. By
1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform
jackets. Four, including <em>Sanctuary</em>, were existing ML titles that were
outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—<em>Selected Short Stories</em>,
<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, <em>A Fable</em>, and <em>Pylon</em>—were new to the series.
<em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, had previously been
combined in a single ML volume.</p>

<p>The bibliographical note on p. [311] reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SANCTUARY, the sixth of William Faulkner’s novels in order of
publication, first appeared on February 9, 1931, but a draft of the
manuscript had been finished nearly two years earlier. The first
Modern Library edition of <em>Sanctuary</em> appeared in the following year
(1932), printed from the original plates, as all subsequent editions
have been. These plates, because of the conditions surrounding their
production, had a larger than usual number of typographical errors,
most of them immediately recognizable as such. Some were discovered
and corrected from time to time, but many remained. A great effort has
been made in this new edition, which was entirely reset, to produce,
with the co-operation of the author, the definitive text.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> has earned a prominent place on the shelf
of the world’s greatest novels. Time does not lessen its appeal. The
years since its publication have witnessed a constantly renewing
enthusiasm for this heroic story of a woman victimized by an
implacable fate. The fate of the novel itself is the highest tribute
to its quality. In the beginning, <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> was
shunned and anathematized as immoral; now it is acknowledgedly one of
the outstanding literary achievements of the nineteenth century.
(<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in light green (144), moderate green (145) and
black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black and cream of a
man and woman on a stone bridge over stream; background in light green
with lettering in black and reverse, all within triple-rule frame in
moderate green. Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1938; unsigned. Front
flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1892. “New and
Completely Revised Edition” published 1893. ML edition (pp. [vii]–457)
printed from plates of the 1893 Harper edition with placement of
CONTENTS and the epigraph from Shakespeare reversed. Published March
1932. <em>WR</em> 16 April 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued
1971/72. Reissued 1979–86.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s a $2,000 advance. Royalties were paid on sales
rather than printings, but the rate has not been ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> sold 7,699 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML
and Giant titles. Hardy’s <em>Return of the Native</em> (126) outsold <em>Tess of
the D’Urbervilles</em> by about 30 copies. <em>The Mayor of Casterbridge</em> (17)
and <em>Jude the Obscure</em> (145) ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles.
<em>The Return of the Native</em> remained the ML’s best-selling Hardy title
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, ranking low
in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em>
and the other two Hardy titles were not among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular series during that period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Implacable fate plays a major role in the novels of Thomas Hardy. In
<em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine
and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim
and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy.
The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality
and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, <em>Tess
of the D’Urbervilles</em> was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is
acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last
decade of the nineteenth century. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bibliographical edition originally published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1920.
ML edition (pp. xxv–[xxxiv], [1] – [508]) printed from offset
plates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with
running heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s
Wessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular
ML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format,
1979–86.</p>
<p>When plans were made to publish <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> in MLCE,
Stein offered Weber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30
June 1950). Weber accepted but added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of
this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first
issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED
BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an
edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier
editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s
“Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent
reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text
for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what,
please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are
going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of
Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a
definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920
edition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport,
Tennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty
of 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML
format, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer.
The ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the
Harper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950).
The map was included at Weber’s suggestion.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Generation after generation of Americans has been brought up on the
poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. To him can be attributed a major
share of what love for poetry great masses of our people cherish. Such
poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles
Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our
heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for
our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great
lyricists of our national literature. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published April 1932. <em>WR</em> 7 May 1932. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Longfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his
time. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when
Longfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes
substantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at
Harvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death
he received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice
what he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained
sufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin
Co., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher,
Ticknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced
its edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott
at Houghton Mifflin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we
first noticed your announcement . . . [Longfellow is the] Poet of
Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled
at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and
office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for
which the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy
acknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).</p>
<p>The ML initially intended to base its edition on <em>The Poems of Henry W.
Longfellow</em>, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library
series. Linscott wrote again four days later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow”
which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright
before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents
as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and
a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19
January 1932).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete
Cambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.</p>
<p>At this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton
Mifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant
figure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537),
intervened. He wrote Cerf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it [the
Longfellow matter]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow
material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that
poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and
have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal
relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have
tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.</p>
<p>Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library
cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, <em>et cetera</em>, or can
you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I
believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February
1932)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of
Longfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to
Linscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932).
Linscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may
have gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the
circumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at
present” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).</p>
<p>In the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the
copyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include
nearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.</p>
<p>When the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who
acknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best
wishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML
edition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a
new typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that
had entered the public domain since 1932.</p>
<p><em>The Poems of Longfellow</em> and <em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em>
(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic
jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets
by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and
Franklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by
a pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for <em>The Poems of
Longfellow</em> remained in use until the early 1940s.</p>
<p>Cerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s,
but it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. <em>The Poems
of Longfellow</em> sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant
titles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed
services. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on
to its first-quarter ranking.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The wide range of Benjamin Franklin’s interests and activities opened
the doors of the world to him. Printer, inventor, philosopher,
diplomat, champion of liberty, he made his influence felt not only
upon his own time, but upon every American generation. His wise maxims
and shrewd observations have become national axioms. His
<em>Autobiography</em>, as rich in material as it is engaging in style, is
one of those rare documents that reveals both a rich personality and
the crucial events that transpired during his lifetime. (<em>Spring

<p>Cerf originally planned to publish Franklin’s <em>Autobiography</em> by itself.
Three months before publication he decided to add more of Franklin’s

(235) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic
jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets
by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and
Longfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from
this day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press
unless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both
the typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think
that the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to
William Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).</p>
<p>The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed
pictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first
printing are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained
in use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive
jackets the ML ever used.</p>
<p><em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em> sold 5,569 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the
second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,468 copies during the
twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—a decline in real terms
compared with the Second World War, when book sales of all kinds were
booming, but enough to place it high in the second quarter of ML and
Giant titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving
romance, <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>, have won acclaim from the critics,
support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators.
Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed,
athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love
story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s
strength. <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> is an exciting book, true to its time
and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp.
[v–vii], [1]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half
title used as a fly title. Published May 1932. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1932. First
printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.</p>
<p>The ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents
a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s <em>Sun Also Rises</em> (190). Cerf
initially hoped to publish <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> in September 1931 (Cerf
to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may
have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931
publication of Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford
in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and
indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January
1932).</p>
<p>There were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies
(July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March
1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling
14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111
copies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf
to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> sold 12,287
copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing
it sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of <em>The Sun
Also Rises</em>. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>
<p>Scribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more
vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of
the Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf,
29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that <em>A Farewell to
Arms</em> was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,
Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound
edition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The devotees of the novels of Joseph Conrad divide their enthusiasm
equally between <em>Victory</em> and <em>Lord Jim</em> (No. 186 in the Modern
Library). Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the World War,
<em>Victory</em> has steadily grown in prestige through almost a quarter of a
century. New readers come upon it as a rare discovery and old readers
return to it for the sheer enjoyment of its prose style and subtle
characterization. <em>Victory</em> represents Joseph Conrad at the apex of
his story-telling powers. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1915. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new Doubleday, Doran typesetting; the
plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published June
1932. <em>WR</em> 2 July 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>Cerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to <em>Victory</em>.
In 1928 he offered an advance of $3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a
royalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to
Nelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do
appreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is
unwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21
December 1928). <em>Victory</em> was included in the Sun Dial Library published
by Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that
specialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial
Library in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title
included in the series. <em>Victory</em> was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial
Library titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500
advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Victory</em> sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant
titles. <em>Lord Jim</em> (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales
of <em>Victory</em> totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad
was one of the ML’s best-selling authors. <em>Victory</em> sold 7,966 copies
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the
twelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. <em>Lord Jim</em> was the eighth
best-selling title.</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War,
<em>Victory</em> was immediately acclaimed the work of a master. It has grown
steadily in the estimation of a new generation of readers who have
come upon it as a rare discovery. Older readers go back to it for the
sheer pleasure of its graceful prose and its subtleties of
characterization. <em>Victory</em> is one of the novels by which Joseph
Conrad achieved the fullest measure of his gifts as story-teller. It
vies for favor with <em>Lord Jim</em> (No. 186), <em>Nostromo</em> (No. 275) and
<em>Heart of Darkness</em> (in <em>Great Modern Short Stories</em>, No. 168).

<p>Front flap:<br>
A band of pirates captures a vessel bound for England that contains a
miscellaneous cargo—including a group of children who have been driven
from their home by a West Indian hurricane. The difficulties
encountered by the well-meaning buccaneers with these incredible
children provide the frame-work for one of the most unusual books in
the Modern Library series—a shocking, nerve-tingling story that the
reader will never forget. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. as <em>The Innocent Voyage</em> by Harper &amp; Bros.,
1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July
1932. <em>WR</em> 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1
January 1958.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated
interest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his
personal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself
have bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros.,
5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk
about a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September
1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he
stated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in
the Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and
I have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the
author’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint
contract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a
warm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the
Modern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is
released” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).</p>
<p>When the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed
Klopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the
Readers Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s
president, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was
available (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and
convinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail
order sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would
like to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the
option to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer
to Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty
remained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed
in 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but
without an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the
ML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club
edition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).</p>
<p>In 1956 the College Department of Harper &amp; Bros. expressed interest in
adding <em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> and Richard Wright’s <em>Native Son</em> (349)
to the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper
director of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the
ML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had
textbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer
replied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition
from an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department
wants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the
Modern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to
Rose, 25 July 1956).</p>
<p><em>A High Wind in Jamaica</em> sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and
Giant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles
in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Selected for their variety and range, the eight plays in this volume
represent the complete pattern of an age. Separately and in their
entirety they exemplify the spirit of the Elizabethan period, the
richest in our literature, by their virility, daring and exuberant
outspokenness. A compilation which includes Marlowe, Dekker, Heywood,
Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Massinger and Ford must be a
treasury to be cherished by every modern reader. It is a book that has
won for itself a distinguished place on the Modern Library shelf.

<p>Original ML anthology. Published August 1932. <em>WR</em> 10 September 1932.

<p>The plays in the anthology were selected by Cerf. He asked George C. D.
Odell of Columbia University what he thought of the selection and
invited him to write the introduction (Cerf to Odell, 9 April 1931).
Odell approved the plays but declined to write the introduction because
he was on sabbatical in Paris. That fall Cerf invited a succession of
scholars to write the introduction—Hardin Craig of Stanford University,
Felix E. Schelling of the University of Pennsylvania, J. F. A. Pyre of
the University of Wisconsin, and John Livingston Lowes of Harvard
University. As one after another declined, Cerf doubled the fee from
fifty to one hundred dollars. Esther Cloudman Dunn of Smith College
accepted the assignment in February 1932 and received the $100 fee.</p>
<p><em>Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays</em> sold 2,678 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the one hundred
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952. The ML sold over 70,000 copies of <em>Eight
Famous Elizabethan Plays</em> by 1969 when <em>Drama of the English
Renaissance</em>, edited by M. L. Wine (615), was published in the ML with
the intent of superseding the earlier anthology.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Alive with light-tipped quips and stinging darts, <em>The Plays of Oscar
Wilde</em> represent in fullest measure the famous decadent’s unique
contribution to English letters. Master of the scintillant epigram and
electric repartee, he is nowhere so happy and felicitous as in his
dramatic writings. In time his prose may grow faint in memory and his
poetry may be given a somewhat less lustrous appraisal, but he will
always be remembered as the creator of these inimitably urbane, ironic
and effervescent comedies. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
“I have nothing to declare except my genius,” Oscar Wilde once told an
American customs official. That genius is nowhere more apparent than
in his plays, whose witty dialogue and paradoxical situations still
have the power to charm, both on the stage and between covers. This
volume contains one of his most perennially popular, <em>The Importance
of Being Earnest</em>, whose satiric comments on English society and the
clergy have never been surpassed; <em>Salomé</em>, considered shocking in its
day, on which Richard Strauss’ opera is based; and three plays, <em>Lady
Windemere’s</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>Fan</em>, <em>a Woman of No Importance</em> and <em>An Ideal
Husband</em>, which give full play to Wilde’s scorn for hypocrisy.</p>

New generations of readers discover in <em>The Poems and Fairy Tales of

It is by these simple and moving fairy tales and by such poems as The
Ballad of Reading Gaol that Oscar Wilde has won an abiding place in
the hearts of children and their elders throughout the world. (<em>Fall

<p>Front flap:<br>
The world owes to the unchallenged master of the short story, Guy de
Maupassant, an immense and increasing debt for having provided a
transcript of life as dynamic as it is real and as true as it is
fascinating. The forty tales in this volume represent him in the
fullness of his powers, when his vision, style and artistry were at
their apex. These stories were chosen and translated by Michael
Monahan, whose introduction is a bold commentary and an acute analysis
of Maupassant’s work. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

the translator of all the stories in the collection. He was credited as
the translator of <em>Love and Other Stories</em> (1919); the ML edition of
<em>Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories</em> (1917) did not identify the
translator. One story appears twice in the combined volume in different
translations. “A Piece of String” (pp. 213–22) was added to <em>Love and
Other Stories</em> by 1930. It was also included (in a different
translation) as “The Piece of String” (pp. 23–31) in <em>Mademoiselle Fifi
and Twelve Other Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Maupassant’s <em>Best Stories</em> sold 6,269 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and
Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The perpetual enchantment and all the magical and multi-colored
pageantry of <em>The Arabian Nights</em> are offered here in Sir Richard
Burton’s rendering for the delectation of adult minds. Shahrazad spins
her tales without censorial interruption, and the spell that possessed
King Shahryar and since then has possessed mankind is not broken,
praise be to Allah, by discreet asterisks and decorous euphemisms. The
tales in this volume were chosen because they are the most fascinating
and representative of <em>The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night</em>.
(<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML selection. Published September 1932. <em>WR</em> 15 October 1932.
First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The title page of <em>The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments</em> had so much text
that there was no room for the torchbearer or for Cerf and Klopfer’s
names in the imprint.</p>
<p>Cerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on
the title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not
strictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation
of “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and
unabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the
stories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional
phrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I
believe it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”
(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce &amp; Co., 16 November 1932). The ML
made three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to
Walter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the
book for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in
September 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition
in November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset &amp; Dunlap
borrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,
paying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy
(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 28 May 1937).</p>
<p><em>The Arabian Nights</em> sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and
Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling ML titles in
the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952.</p>

Kuprin an indictment more scathing and effective than all the moral
indignation of vice crusaders and the periodical revelations of the

<p>Guerney translation originally published (“privately printed”) for
subscribers only, 1922. New edition published by Bernard Guilbert
Guerney, 1929, with additions, revisions, and corrections by the author,
a foreword by Arthur Garfield Hays, and an author’s postscript. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting based on the
1929 edition. Publication scheduled for October 1932 but moved forward
to September when Marx’s <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other
Writings</em> (246) was postponed. <em>WR</em> 15 October 1932. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued fall 1952.</p>
<p>Guerney’s introduction to the 1929 edition was revised for the ML.</p>
<p>The ML paid Guerney a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy. The contract specified that royalties were to drop to 9½ cents
after the first 20,000 copies. Cerf originally offered Guerney royalties
of 9½ cents on all copies but increased the offer following negotiations
with Guerney. The $800 cost of making new plates was split between
Guerney and the ML. Guerney’s half was to be charged against royalties
after sales passed 20,000 copies, and the plates were to remain the
property of the ML (Cerf to Guerney, 17 February 1931).</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> sold 2,700 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
With one-sixth of the habitable world governed by Marxian doctrines
and with the rest of the world facing the possibility of a Communist
social order, the writings of Karl Marx become more a modern
revelation and prophecy than a mere economic interpretation of
history. His <em>Capital and Other Writings</em>, judiciously and
discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a
newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the
shelf of the Modern Library. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of <em>Capital</em>
and Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint
of <em>The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of
“Capital,”</em> edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L.
Trask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML
edition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until
October because of additions to the manuscript. <em>WR</em> 12 November 1932.
First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p><em>The People’s Marx</em> does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S.
The ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L.
Trask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and
it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic
theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is
usually done” (p. xix). The selections from <em>The German Ideology</em> and
<em>Critique of Political Economy</em> in Part II were added by the ML.</p>
<p>Cerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was
prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was
compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy
encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of
Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932).
Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his
name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he
would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The
Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent
Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally
projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an
introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a
Russian magazine called <em>Education</em>. To this very orthodox statement by
Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark
made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something
complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this
theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must
advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p.
xix).</p>
<p>Shortly after the publication of <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and
Other Writings</em>, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of
Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and
edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was
cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested,
Declined” under 1933 for more information.</p>
<p>M. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack
of an index to <em>Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings</em>:
“I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an
index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which
Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember
your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not
Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that
Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to
Schuster, 8 February 1933).</p>
<p>Sales figures from the 1930s are not available. <em>Capital, The Communist
Manifesto and Other Writings</em> sold 4,391 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and
Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952
with sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that <em>Capital, The
Communist Manifesto and Other Writings</em> had sold nearly 4,000 copies in
the past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).</p>
<p>The ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s
<em>Capital</em> (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854
copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333
copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952,
placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Entire nations and even a continent have come under the dominance of
the ideas taught by Karl Marx. His major work, <em>Capital</em>, is accepted
in a large part of the world as revealed truth and its doctrines are
looked upon as more than the economic interpretation of history the
book attempted to offer. <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, written in
collaboration with Friedrich Engels, framed the fiery slogans now
familiar to the world. This volume of Karl Marx’s principal writings,
edited by Max Eastman, includes the most important chapters form
<em>Capital</em>, the entire <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, Marx’s conception of
history and an essay by Lenin. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
When <em>Pickwick Papers</em> first appeared, the world-wide reputation of
Charles Dickens was made. Today, exactly a century later, this book
has multiplied its enthusiastic readers by millions. It will always
stand as the symbol of kindness, simplicity and almost farcical
gallantry. Mr. Pickwick’s adventures remain to all generations of
readers the whimsical exploits of a man beloved for his eccentricities
and his deep humanity. (<em>Fall 1938</em>)</p>

October 1932. <em>WR</em> 12 November 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>When the ML edition was published Cerf sent a letter to book review
editors in which he pointed out that the plates were brand new. He
stated, “I expect the book to be one of the most popular in our series
year in and year out” (Cerf to Laurence Stallings, c/o The New York Sun,
24 October 1932). It sold 7,325 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it at the top of the second quarter of ML
and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952 it sold 3,299 copies, making it one-hundredth out of the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in brownish orange (54) and black on pale orange
yellow (73) paper depicting three soldiers learning against a ship’s
rail with black sea in background; borders in brownish orange, lettering
in black. Signed: W.C. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The years that have passed since the World War have been severe to the
literature of that disastrous episode in human history. Only a few
books have survived. Of these, <em>Three Soldiers</em> stands pre-eminent. It
reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the
experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture
in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. <em>Three
Soldiers</em> introduced a writer who has since become a major figure
among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests
securely. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed
from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates
appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled
for November 1932. <em>WR</em> 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies.
Discontinued 1963.</p>
<p>Eight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday,
Doran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern
Library, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and
Three Soldiers.” He asked how many copies <em>Three Soldiers</em> had sold in
the trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial
Library (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that
the plates for <em>Three Soldiers</em> were too large for the ML’s format he
contacted Harper &amp; Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s
<em>Manhattan Transfer</em> and <em>The 42nd Parallel</em>. <em>Manhattan Transfer</em> had
sold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for <em>The 42nd Parallel</em> (Henry
Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those
titles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin
with <em>Three Soldiers</em> and added <em>The 42nd Parallel</em> (307) to the ML five
years later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos
Passos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.</p>
<p>For <em>Three Soldiers</em> the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250
against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his
corrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know
if I made more corrections in the <em>Three Soldiers</em> text than you can
handle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were
just going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was
away when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked
Cerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling
corrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.
The introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was
doing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,
undated).</p>
<p><em>Three Soldiers</em> sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant
titles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from
Doubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500
copies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20
August 1946). <em>Three Soldiers</em> did not rank among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>Houghton Mifflin withdrew <em>Three Soldiers</em> and Dos Passos’s <em>U.S.A.</em>
(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality
paperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination
agreement in June and instructed the production department to make no
more printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June
1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock
and asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to
bring out <em>Three Soldiers</em> until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick
Moseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated
that the ML had 3,000 copies of <em>Three Soldiers</em>, enough to last about a
year, and a six- to eight-month supply of <em>U.S.A.</em> (Klopfer to Moseley,
22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if
<em>Three Soldiers</em> was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was
(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January
1964). <em>Three Soldiers</em> was published in Sentry Editions later that
year.</p>
<p><em>Three Soldiers</em> was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after
fall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the
end of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to <em>The
Buddhist Tradition</em>, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring
1969 after the oversight was discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
An historical and spiritual revelation, <em>Power</em> is at once an unerring
psychological and throbbing physical evocation of a human being and of
the whole pageant of mankind. All the hope and frustration, the
idealism and iniquity, the sensualism and ascetism [<em>sic</em>] of an
epoch come into a magical synthesis on Feuchtwanger’s enormous canvas.
Süss, the Jew, becomes more than the central character of an
historical novel laid in eighteenth-century Württemberg; he is the
core and the symbol of a race whose intellectual and idealistic
mission is timeless and unending. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muir translation originally published in U.S. by Viking Press, 1926. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for November 1932. <em>WR</em> 17 December 1932. First printing:
6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.</p>
<p>The Muir translation of Feuchtwanger’s <em>Jud</em> <em>Süß</em> was published in
London under the title <em>Jew Süss</em> and in the U.S. as <em>Power</em>. The Viking
plates were too large for the ML’s format. The ML paid Viking Press $800
on publication. Other financial details, including whether Viking Press
or the ML paid for the new typesetting, have not been ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Power</em> sold 2,677 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations.
Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second
only to the furore created by his own <em>Trilby</em>. Then as a play, it has
been, since 1915, a perennial favorite. As an opera, with a score by
Deems Taylor, it found a prominent place in the repertory of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, and, finally as a cinema, it has reached
countless thousands of people. In its original form, it remains a book
of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1891. New
bibliographical edition published by Harper &amp; Brothers with a 1919
copyright date; the new edition was probably published in the 1920s. ML
edition (pp. [ii], v–vii, [1]–416) printed from plates of the later
Harper edition. Published December 1932. <em>WR</em> 31 December 1932. First
printing: 7,450 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p>The royalties that the ML paid to Harper &amp; Brothers were based on sales,
in contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number
of copies printed. <em>Peter Ibbetson</em> was one of the few books in the ML
printed on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary
because of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first
printing may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing
of 8,000 copies and received 7,450.</p>
<p>When the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s
that it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations
and asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp;
Bros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the
wood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the
plates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s
balloon-cloth format.</p>
<p><em>Peter Ibbetson</em> sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
How to make available to the contemporary reader all the beauty of
thought, language and imagery of <em>The Divine Comedy</em> has been the
primary consideration of the editors of the Modern Library in issuing
this translated version of Dante’s masterpiece, complete and
unabridged. After careful consideration of all the extant English
translations and after consultation with the foremost university
authorities, the Carlyle-Wicksteed rendering was chosen. It gives the
entire scope, substance and spirit of <em>The Divine Comedy</em> to those
numberless readers who cannot cope with the original. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

<p>Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by
J. M. Dent &amp; Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December
1932. <em>WR</em> 31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and
subsequently in Vintage Books.</p>
<p>The ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of
reports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from
Henry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the
translation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice
Firuski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the
translation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by
T. S. Eliot and offered Faber &amp; Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on
Dante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent
of Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski,
28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an
introduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to
Grandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.</p>
<p>Cerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few
paragraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932).
Grandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using
and knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the
best translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher
(Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an
inferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the
Temple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph
by the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of
the English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle,
Thomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is
clear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be
readily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its
scholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p.
xiii).</p>
<p>The Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s
<em>Divine Comedy</em> the best translations have been followed: <em>Inferno</em>, by
John Aiken Carlyle; <em>Purgatorio</em>, by Thomas Okey; <em>Paradisio</em>, by Philip
H. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim)
follow, in the main, the excellent notes for the <em>Inferno</em> and the
<em>Purgatorio</em> by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr.
Oeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the <em>Paradisio</em>” (251.1, p. 3;
251.2, p. xvii).</p>
<p>ML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to
the translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the
translator of <em>Purgatorio</em>. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library
(IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations
were not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML
printings until 1963/64 (251.2c).</p>
<p>Shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S.
Singleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of
<em>The Divine Comedy</em> for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working
on a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled
to be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the
seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the
approval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after
theirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances
totaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took
longer than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years
later it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The
Bollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and
1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary.
By that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become
moribund and had ceased adding new titles.</p>
<p><em>The Divine Comedy</em> sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant
titles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.</p>

Published\nJanuary 1932. *WR* 13 February 1932. First printing: 17,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1938.\n\nCerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of *The Magic Mountain* in\n1929, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather\nthan the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have\nto be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint\ncontract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf\ndid not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the\nstandard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years\n(Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have\nnot been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12\ncents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the\nend the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular\nprinters.\n\nSales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883\ncopies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies\n(1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nKnopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year\nterm. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will\nbe a $3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more\nrevenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have\nthe book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada,\n18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in\nOctober 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint\ncontract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a\nlarge final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his\nappreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your\nattitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot\nof things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf\nto Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.\n\nCerf never accepted the loss of *The Magic Mountain* and tried\nrepeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical.\nIn 1942, after Mann’s *Buddenbrooks* (285) had also been withdrawn from\nthe ML, Cerf offered a $5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a\ncopy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you”\nfor permission to publish *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant. He added,\n“Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know\nwhy this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back\nthan any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July\n1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is\njust too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on\nany arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the\nnecessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied:\n“I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow\n*Buddenbrooks* into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann\ntitle somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent\nthe best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).\n\n*The Magic Mountain* was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s\nacquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired\nthe Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W.\nDodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and\nBoni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. \\[*1*\\]–557) printed from\nDreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nDreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The\nEarly Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it\nwas rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday,\nPage at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a\nreader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:\n\n> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its\n> frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and\n> because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be\n> withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in\n> circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that\n> the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to\n> insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal\n> adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his\n> share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was\n> legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a\n> contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include\n> *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in\n> the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because\n> no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did\n> manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred\n> of them. (p. vi)\n\n[James L. W. West\nIII](http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html)\nnotes:\n\n> Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a\n> vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read\n> the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For\n> whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the\n> narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish\n> it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw\n> the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication.\n> Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed\n> to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no\n> obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and\n> Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of\n> Pennsylvania Library, 2000).\n\nDoubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450\nunbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456\ncopies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and\nDreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates\nthat the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies\nof *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &\nCompany (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later\npurchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister\nCarrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.\n\nThe ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a\n$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the\nadvance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates\nwhich had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited\nto Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML\nedition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.\nDreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing\nwas required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions\nfor the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s\ndeath the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser\nPapers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).\n\nDreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was\noriginally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s\nNote on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:\n\n> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern\n> Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as\n> much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and\n> spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser,\n> however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements\n> covering the two-fifty edition \\[the trade edition published by Boni &\n> Liveright in 1917\\], and it was only in February, 1932, after more\n> attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us\n> do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.\n\n*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the\n1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies\nby the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of\n$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in\nthe first quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n**230b.

(*Fall 1931*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9\nApril 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. *The Stories of Anton\nTchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories*\n(27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision\nof the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been\nawaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short\nStories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to\nscrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection\nthat we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected\nwith due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the\nfourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s\ncollection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).\n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the\nspelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use\nof “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton\nTchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of\nthat spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to\n“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.\n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.

Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine\nprinting business, Pynson Printers, and to *The Colophon*, the\nbibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random\nHouse was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library,\nInc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933,\nfollowing the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer\nturned seriously to trade publishing.\n\nML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide\nexceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes\npublished in 1932 sold for $1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages\nper volume.\n\nThe ML published a full-page ad in *Publishers’ Weekly* that lampooned\nthe publishing industry adage, “You can’t sell books like soap.”\nAdapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed “They\nFloat!” and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with\nfive Modern Library books—*Of Human Bondage*, *Swann’s Way*, *The Magic\nMountain*, *Droll Stories*, and *Sanctuary*—floating on the surface of\nthe water (*PW*, 14 May 1932, p. 2015).\n\n### Number of titles\n\nTwenty-four titles were added and fifteen were discontinued, bringing\nthe number of titles in the regular ML to 207. Six of the discontinued\ntitles (two by Maupassant and four by Wilde) were repackaged as three\nvolumes to offer better value. Chekhov, *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other\nStories*, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more\ncomprehensive collection, *The Stories of Anton Tchekov*, edited by\nRobert Linscott). Three new titles in ML Giants, including Gibbon,\n*Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* in two volumes, brought the\nnumber of Giants to six titles in seven volumes. *Decline and Fall of\nthe Roman Empire* was expanded to three volumes in 1946.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles except Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* (230) were published in\nthe standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110\nmm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Sister\nCarrie* was ¼ in. taller.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type; all but three had torchbearer A2.\nDostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (228) had torchbearer A3; Dos\nPassos, *Three Soldiers* (248) had torchbearer C1; *The Arabian Nights’\nEntertainments* (244) had no torchbearer on the title page. All new\ntitles except *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had the 3-line\nimprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text\nthat there was no room for a torchbearer or Cerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners.\n\n### Binding\n\nBalloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nRockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nEighteen of the 1932 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Four were published in uniform typographic jacket D\nand two in uniform typographic jacket F. Nearly all new titles published\nbetween 1932 and the introduction of the ML’s larger format in fall 1939\nhad pictorial jackets. Uniform typographic jacket D was used on newly\npublished titles for the last time in spring 1932. The final examples of\nits use, *Poems of Longfellow* (235) and Franklin, *Autobiography and\nSelections from His Other Writings* (236), provoked an angry letter from\nCerf, who had apparently given instructions that the jacket was no\nlonger to be used for new titles.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* xDickens, *Pickwick Papers*; Giants\nthrough G5. (Fall) Dickens, *Pickwick Papers* xLewis, *Arrowsmith*;\nGiants through G7.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf approached Arthur Pell at Liveright, Inc., about including a volume\nof plays by Eugene O’Neill in ML Giants (Cerf to Pell, 16 November\n1932). Nothing came of this initiative. O’Neill became a Random House\nauthor the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O’Neill’s\n*Nine Plays* (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added\nto the Giants in 1941.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens’s *Crock\nof Gold* (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs,\nthe president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the\npresident of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML\nreprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, “We\nare simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a\ncheap edition we would do it ourselves” (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).\n\nCerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge\nplays, saying “If we can’t get this from you by peaceable means in the\nnext two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston\nunderworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with\nlighted matches until you sign on the dotted line” (Cerf to Schaff, 16\nNovember 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to\n*Kim* (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to\nconsider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Edmund Wilson’s *Axel’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative\nLiterature of 1870–1930*, which had been published by Charles Scribner’s\nSons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with\nWilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested\nadding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed\npublishing under a new title such as *Literary Essays* or *Essays on\nModern Authors*. He also asked for an advance of $500 (Wilson to Cerf,\n28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays\nhe had considered adding to *Axel’s Castle* into a new book (Wilson to\nCerf, 6 November 1933).\n\nDale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a\none-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm\nof Albert & Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes\ncomprising Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, would welcome some\nready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in\n1930, and the firm “was in major trouble” by the early 1930s (“Albert\nand Charles Boni” in *American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980*,\np. 57).\n\nThe ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, *Swann’s Way* (1928)\nand *Within a Budding Grove* (1930), and would add *Guermantes Way* in\n1933. Cerf thought that Warren’s suggestion was an excellent idea except\nfrom the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked\nWarren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris\nGreenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. “We\nhave had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire\nProust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might\nbe able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that\nanything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as\npossible. Something <u>must</u> break in this situation before the\nsummer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining\nin original). Five months later he indicated, “I have not given up hopes\nof buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything\ndevelops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you\nimmediately” (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure\n*Remembrance of Things Past* a year or so later. The Random House\nedition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf\ndescribed it as “one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934” (Cerf,\n*At Random*, p. 99).\n\nWarren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of\nProust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but\nadded that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust\nif the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather’s *My Antonia*,\nwhich he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to\nWarren, 13 September 1943).\n\n### New titles\n\nDostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 228\n\nMann, *Magic Mountain* (1932) 229\n\nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932) 230\n\nStoker, *Dracula* (1932) 231\n\nChekhov, *Stories of Anton Tchekov* (1932–1956), *Stories of Anton\nChekhov* (1957–1963), *Short Stories of Anton Chekhov* (1964– ) 232\n\nFaulkner, *Sanctuary* (1932) 233\n\nHardy, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* (1932) 234\n\nLongfellow, *Poems* (1932–1945), *Poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*\n(1945– ) 235\n\nFranklin, *Autobiography Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other\nWritings* (1932) 236\n\nHemingway, *Farewell to Arms* (1932) 237\n\nConrad, *Victory* (1932) 238\n\nHughes, *High Wind in Jamaica* (1932) 239\n\n*Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays* (1932) 240\n\n***  \nSpring***\n\n### 228\n\n**FYODOR DOSTOYEVSKY.

First printing: 17,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1938.\n\nCerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of *The Magic Mountain* in\n1929, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather\nthan the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have\nto be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint\ncontract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf\ndid not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the\nstandard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years\n(Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have\nnot been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12\ncents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the\nend the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular\nprinters.\n\nSales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883\ncopies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies\n(1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nKnopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year\nterm. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will\nbe a $3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more\nrevenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have\nthe book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada,\n18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in\nOctober 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint\ncontract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a\nlarge final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his\nappreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your\nattitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot\nof things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf\nto Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.\n\nCerf never accepted the loss of *The Magic Mountain* and tried\nrepeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical.\nIn 1942, after Mann’s *Buddenbrooks* (285) had also been withdrawn from\nthe ML, Cerf offered a $5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a\ncopy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you”\nfor permission to publish *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant. He added,\n“Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know\nwhy this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back\nthan any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July\n1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is\njust too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on\nany arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the\nnecessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied:\n“I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow\n*Buddenbrooks* into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann\ntitle somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent\nthe best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).\n\n*The Magic Mountain* was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s\nacquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML\nin 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMann, *Buddenbrooks* (1935–1940) 285\n\nMann, Thomas, *Stories of Three Decades* (Giant, 1961–1973; 1979–1986)\nG97\n\nMann, *Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man* (1965–1971) 577\n\nMann, *Doctor Faustus* (1966– ) 582\n\n### 230\n\n***THEODORE DREISER.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired\nthe Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W.\nDodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and\nBoni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. \\[*1*\\]–557) printed from\nDreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nDreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The\nEarly Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it\nwas rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday,\nPage at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a\nreader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:\n\n> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its\n> frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and\n> because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be\n> withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in\n> circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that\n> the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to\n> insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal\n> adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his\n> share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was\n> legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a\n> contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include\n> *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in\n> the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because\n> no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did\n> manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred\n> of them. (p. vi)\n\n[James L. W. West\nIII](http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html)\nnotes:\n\n> Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a\n> vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read\n> the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For\n> whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the\n> narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish\n> it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw\n> the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication.\n> Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed\n> to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no\n> obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and\n> Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of\n> Pennsylvania Library, 2000).\n\nDoubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450\nunbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456\ncopies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and\nDreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates\nthat the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies\nof *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &\nCompany (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later\npurchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister\nCarrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.\n\nThe ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a\n$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the\nadvance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates\nwhich had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited\nto Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML\nedition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.\nDreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing\nwas required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions\nfor the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s\ndeath the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser\nPapers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).\n\nDreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was\noriginally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s\nNote on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:\n\n> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern\n> Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as\n> much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and\n> spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser,\n> however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements\n> covering the two-fifty edition \\[the trade edition published by Boni &\n> Liveright in 1917\\], and it was only in February, 1932, after more\n> attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us\n> do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.\n\n*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the\n1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies\nby the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of\n$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in\nthe first quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n**230b.

(*Fall 1931*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9\nApril 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. *The Stories of Anton\nTchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories*\n(27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision\nof the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been\nawaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short\nStories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to\nscrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection\nthat we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected\nwith due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the\nfourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s\ncollection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).\n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the\nspelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use\nof “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton\nTchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of\nthat spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to\n“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.\n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.

Published March 1932. *WR*\n26 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\nPublished in Vintage Books, spring 1967.\n\nCerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the\nML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your\nModern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to\ntake with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE\nFURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the\ntime the book was published, in your list \\[Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,\n*On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,* was published by Cape &\nSmith in 1929\\]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will\nbe a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us\nup.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few\nvolumes. He requested Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*\nand any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books\nin which a Dostoyefsky \\[*sic*\\] influence was found. I have never read\nDostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf,\n15 April 1931).\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to include *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay\nDying*, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type\nwhich had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s\naudience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the\ncost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in\nproduction and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House\nbetween 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for\nbooks without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was\ncheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the\npossibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year\nor so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be\ninstructed to melt the type (Harter, *The Making of William Faulkner’s\nBooks, 1929*–*1939*, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult\nfor reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive\nreprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial\npublication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from\nthe original publisher’s plates.\n\nFaulkner’s next book, *Sanctuary*, had more commercial appeal. It was\nthe only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were\nmade. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback.\nThe American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet\nBooks—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight\nprintings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies\n(Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on\nfront cover).\n\nIn his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he\ninitially wrote *Sanctuary* for money. The introduction begins:\n\n> This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea,\n> because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been\n> writing books for about five years, which got published but not\n> bought. . . .\n>\n> Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in\n> terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of\n> it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in\n> Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought\n> was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could\n> imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)\n\nAfter sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job\nworking the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between\n12 and 4, I wrote *As I Lay Dying* in six weeks, without changing a\nword. I sent it to Smith \\[his publisher\\] and wrote him that by it I\nwould stand or fall.” He continues:\n\n> I think I had forgotten about *Sanctuary*, just as you might forget\n> about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.\n> *As I Lay Dying* was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of\n> *Sanctuary* until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so\n> terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite\n> it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy\n> it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been\n> already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting\n> it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame *The\n> Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* too much and I made a fair\n> job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they\n> will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)\n\nFaulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than\nthe rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be\nreset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees\nBook Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the\nintroduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like\nBurck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when\nE. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger\nformat.\n\nFaulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith &\nHaas. *Sanctuary* remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published together\nin a single volume.\n\n*Sanctuary* sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nFaulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel\nPrize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the\nseries. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in\nterms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952. *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was the fifth\nbest-selling title in the regular ML, followed by *Light in August*\n(429), *Absalom, Absalom!* (434), and *Sanctuary* (233), which sold\n4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in\nthe regular ML.\n\n#### 233.1b.

In\n> *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine\n> and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim\n> and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy.\n> The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality\n> and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, *Tess\n> of the D’Urbervilles* was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is\n> acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last\n> decade of the nineteenth century. (*Fall 1956*)\n\nBibliographical edition originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1920.\nML edition (pp. xxv–\\[xxxiv\\], \\[1\\] – \\[508\\]) printed from offset\nplates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with\nrunning heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s\nWessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular\nML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format,\n1979–86.\n\nWhen plans were made to publish *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* in MLCE,\nStein offered Weber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30\nJune 1950). Weber accepted but added:\n\n> I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of\n> this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first\n> issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED\n> BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an\n> edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier\n> editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s\n> “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent\n> reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text\n> for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what,\n> please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are\n> going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of\n> Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a\n> definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).\n\nStein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920\nedition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport,\nTennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty\nof 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML\nformat, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer.\nThe ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the\nHarper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950).\nThe map was included at Weber’s suggestion.\n\n#### 234.2b.

Such\n> poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles\n> Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our\n> heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for\n> our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great\n> lyricists of our national literature. (*Spring 1938*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nLongfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his\ntime. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when\nLongfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes\nsubstantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at\nHarvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death\nhe received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice\nwhat he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained\nsufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin\nCo., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher,\nTicknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced\nits edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott\nat Houghton Mifflin:\n\n> A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we\n> first noticed your announcement . . . \\[Longfellow is the\\] Poet of\n> Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled\n> at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and\n> office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”\n\nLinscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for\nwhich the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy\nacknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).\n\nThe ML initially intended to base its edition on *The Poems of Henry W.\nLongfellow*, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library\nseries. Linscott wrote again four days later:\n\n> You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow”\n> which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright\n> before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents\n> as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and\n> a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19\n> January 1932).\n\nLinscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete\nCambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.\n\nAt this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton\nMifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant\nfigure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537),\nintervened. He wrote Cerf:\n\n> I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it \\[the\n> Longfellow matter\\]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow\n> material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that\n> poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and\n> have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal\n> relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have\n> tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.\n>\n> Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library\n> cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, *et cetera*, or can\n> you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I\n> believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February\n> 1932)\n\nBoth Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of\nLongfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to\nLinscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932).\nLinscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may\nhave gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the\ncircumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at\npresent” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).\n\nIn the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the\ncopyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include\nnearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.\n\nWhen the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who\nacknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best\nwishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML\nedition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a\nnew typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that\nhad entered the public domain since 1932.\n\n*The Poems of Longfellow* and *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*\n(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic\njacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets\nby 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and\nFranklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by\na pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for *The Poems of\nLongfellow* remained in use until the early 1940s.\n\nCerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s,\nbut it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. *The Poems\nof Longfellow* sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed\nservices. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on\nto its first-quarter ranking.\n\n#### 235.1b.

Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets\nby 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and\nLongfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from\nthis day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press\nunless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both\nthe typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think\nthat the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to\nWilliam Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).\n\nThe Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed\npictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first\nprinting are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained\nin use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive\njackets the ML ever used.\n\n*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* sold 5,569 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp.\n\\[v–vii\\], \\[1\\]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half\ntitle used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.\n\nThe ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf\ninitially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf\nto Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may\nhave been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931\npublication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford\nin Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and\nindicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January\n1932).\n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies\n(July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March\n1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling\n14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111\ncopies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf\nto Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *A Farewell to Arms* sold 12,287\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing\nit sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of *The Sun\nAlso Rises*. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of\nthe Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf,\n29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *A Farewell to\nArms* was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nedition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.\n\n#### 237b.

(*Fall 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1915.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nCerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to *Victory*.\nIn 1928 he offered an advance of $3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a\nroyalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to\nNelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do\nappreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is\nunwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21\nDecember 1928). *Victory* was included in the Sun Dial Library published\nby Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that\nspecialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial\nLibrary in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title\nincluded in the series. *Victory* was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial\nLibrary titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\n*Victory* sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Lord Jim* (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales\nof *Victory* totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad\nwas one of the ML’s best-selling authors. *Victory* sold 7,966 copies\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the\ntwelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. *Lord Jim* was the eighth\nbest-selling title.\n\n#### 238b.

(*Spring 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros.,\n1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July\n1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1958.\n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated\ninterest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his\npersonal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself\nhave bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros.,\n5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk\nabout a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September\n1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he\nstated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in\nthe Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and\nI have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the\nauthor’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint\ncontract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a\nwarm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the\nModern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is\nreleased” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).\n\nWhen the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed\nKlopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the\nReaders Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s\npresident, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was\navailable (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and\nconvinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail\norder sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would\nlike to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the\noption to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer\nto Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty\nremained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed\nin 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but\nwithout an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the\nML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club\nedition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).\n\nIn 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in\nadding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349)\nto the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper\ndirector of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the\nML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had\ntextbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer\nreplied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition\nfrom an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department\nwants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the\nModern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to\nRose, 25 July 1956).\n\n*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles\nin the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952.\n\n#### 239b.

The statement on\nthe title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not\nstrictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation\nof “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and\nunabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the\nstories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional\nphrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I\nbelieve it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”\n(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML\nmade three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to\nWalter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the\nbook for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in\nSeptember 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition\nin November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap\nborrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,\npaying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).\n\n*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.

(*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of *Capital*\nand Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint\nof *The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of\n“Capital,”* edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L.\nTrask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML\nedition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until\nOctober because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S.\nThe ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L.\nTrask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and\nit seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic\ntheories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is\nusually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and\n*Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.\n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was\nprominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was\ncompiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy\nencyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of\nMarx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932).\nCerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his\nname may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he\nwould cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The\nLenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent\nParts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally\nprojected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an\nintroduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a\nRussian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by\nLenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark\nmade by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something\ncomplete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this\ntheory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must\nadvance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p.\nxix).\n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and\nOther Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of\nLenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and\nedit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was\ncancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested,\nDeclined” under 1933 for more information.\n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack\nof an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*:\n“I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an\nindex. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which\nKarl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember\nyour obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not\nGroucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that\nSchuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to\nSchuster, 8 February 1933).\n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist\nManifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952\nwith sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The\nCommunist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in\nthe past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).\n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s\n*Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333\ncopies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.\n\n#### 246b.

Only a few\n> books have survived. Of these, *Three Soldiers* stands pre-eminent. It\n> reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the\n> experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture\n> in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. *Three\n> Soldiers* introduced a writer who has since become a major figure\n> among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests\n> securely. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed\nfrom Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates\nappear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled\nfor November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1963.\n\nEight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday,\nDoran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern\nLibrary, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and\nThree Soldiers.” He asked how many copies *Three Soldiers* had sold in\nthe trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial\nLibrary (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that\nthe plates for *Three Soldiers* were too large for the ML’s format he\ncontacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer* and *The 42nd Parallel*. *Manhattan Transfer* had\nsold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for *The 42nd Parallel* (Henry\nHoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those\ntitles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin\nwith *Three Soldiers* and added *The 42nd Parallel* (307) to the ML five\nyears later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos\nPassos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.\n\nFor *Three Soldiers* the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his\ncorrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know\nif I made more corrections in the *Three Soldiers* text than you can\nhandle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were\njust going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was\naway when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked\nCerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling\ncorrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.\nThe introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was\ndoing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,\nundated).\n\n*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from\nDoubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500\ncopies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20\nAugust 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\nHoughton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.*\n(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality\npaperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination\nagreement in June and instructed the production department to make no\nmore printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June\n1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock\nand asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to\nbring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick\nMoseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated\nthat the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a\nyear, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley,\n22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if\n*Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was\n(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January\n1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that\nyear.\n\n*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after\nfall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the\nend of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The\nBuddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring\n1969 after the oversight was discovered.\n\n#### 248b.

Discontinued fall 1956.\n\nThe royalties that the ML paid to Harper & Brothers were based on sales,\nin contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number\nof copies printed. *Peter Ibbetson* was one of the few books in the ML\nprinted on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary\nbecause of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first\nprinting may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing\nof 8,000 copies and received 7,450.\n\nWhen the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s\nthat it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations\nand asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper &\nBros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the\nwood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the\nplates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s\nballoon-cloth format.\n\n*Peter Ibbetson* sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles.

Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1937; unsigned. Front flap as\njacket A. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nCarlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by\nJ. M. Dent & Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December\n1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and\nsubsequently in Vintage Books.\n\nThe ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of\nreports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from\nHenry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the\ntranslation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice\nFiruski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the\ntranslation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by\nT. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on\nDante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent\nof Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski,\n28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an\nintroduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to\nGrandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.\n\nCerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few\nparagraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932).\nGrandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using\nand knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the\nbest translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher\n(Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an\ninferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the\nTemple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph\nby the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of\nthe English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle,\nThomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is\nclear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be\nreadily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its\nscholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p.\nxiii).\n\nThe Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s\n*Divine Comedy* the best translations have been followed: *Inferno*, by\nJohn Aiken Carlyle; *Purgatorio*, by Thomas Okey; *Paradisio*, by Philip\nH. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim)\nfollow, in the main, the excellent notes for the *Inferno* and the\n*Purgatorio* by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr.\nOeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the *Paradisio*” (251.1, p. 3;\n251.2, p. xvii).\n\nML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to\nthe translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the\ntranslator of *Purgatorio*. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library\n(IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations\nwere not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML\nprintings until 1963/64 (251.2c).\n\nShortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S.\nSingleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of\n*The Divine Comedy* for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working\non a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled\nto be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the\nseven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the\napproval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after\ntheirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances\ntotaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took\nlonger than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years\nlater it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The\nBollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and\n1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary.\nBy that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become\nmoribund and had ceased adding new titles.\n\n*The Divine Comedy* sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant\ntitles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 251.1b.

Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine\nprinting business, Pynson Printers, and to *The Colophon*, the\nbibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random\nHouse was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library,\nInc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933,\nfollowing the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer\nturned seriously to trade publishing.\n\nML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide\nexceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes\npublished in 1932 sold for $1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages\nper volume.\n\nThe ML published a full-page ad in *Publishers’ Weekly* that lampooned\nthe publishing industry adage, “You can’t sell books like soap.”\nAdapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed “They\nFloat!” and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with\nfive Modern Library books—*Of Human Bondage*, *Swann’s Way*, *The Magic\nMountain*, *Droll Stories*, and *Sanctuary*—floating on the surface of\nthe water (*PW*, 14 May 1932, p. 2015).",

Chekhov, *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other\nStories*, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more\ncomprehensive collection, *The Stories of Anton Tchekov*, edited by\nRobert Linscott).

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf approached Arthur Pell at Liveright, Inc., about including a volume\nof plays by Eugene O’Neill in ML Giants (Cerf to Pell, 16 November\n1932). Nothing came of this initiative. O’Neill became a Random House\nauthor the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O’Neill’s\n*Nine Plays* (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added\nto the Giants in 1941.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens’s *Crock\nof Gold* (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs,\nthe president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the\npresident of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML\nreprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, “We\nare simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a\ncheap edition we would do it ourselves” (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).\n\nCerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge\nplays, saying “If we can’t get this from you by peaceable means in the\nnext two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston\nunderworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with\nlighted matches until you sign on the dotted line” (Cerf to Schaff, 16\nNovember 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to\n*Kim* (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to\nconsider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Edmund Wilson’s *Axel’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative\nLiterature of 1870–1930*, which had been published by Charles Scribner’s\nSons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with\nWilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested\nadding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed\npublishing under a new title such as *Literary Essays* or *Essays on\nModern Authors*. He also asked for an advance of $500 (Wilson to Cerf,\n28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays\nhe had considered adding to *Axel’s Castle* into a new book (Wilson to\nCerf, 6 November 1933).\n\nDale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a\none-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm\nof Albert & Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes\ncomprising Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, would welcome some\nready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in\n1930, and the firm “was in major trouble” by the early 1930s (“Albert\nand Charles Boni” in *American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980*,\np. 57).\n\nThe ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, *Swann’s Way* (1928)\nand *Within a Budding Grove* (1930), and would add *Guermantes Way* in\n1933. Cerf thought that Warren’s suggestion was an excellent idea except\nfrom the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked\nWarren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris\nGreenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. “We\nhave had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire\nProust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might\nbe able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that\nanything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as\npossible. Something <u>must</u> break in this situation before the\nsummer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining\nin original). Five months later he indicated, “I have not given up hopes\nof buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything\ndevelops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you\nimmediately” (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure\n*Remembrance of Things Past* a year or so later. The Random House\nedition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf\ndescribed it as “one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934” (Cerf,\n*At Random*, p. 99).\n\nWarren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of\nProust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but\nadded that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust\nif the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather’s *My Antonia*,\nwhich he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to\nWarren, 13 September 1943).",

Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\]–900) printed from Knopf\nplates with table of contents consolidated from vols. 1 and 2, fly title\nomitted, and page numeral “xi” removed from the foreword. Published\nJanuary 1932. *WR* 13 February 1932. First printing: 17,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1938.\n\nCerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of *The Magic Mountain* in\n1929, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather\nthan the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have\nto be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint\ncontract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf\ndid not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the\nstandard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years\n(Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have\nnot been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12\ncents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the\nend the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular\nprinters.\n\nSales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883\ncopies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies\n(1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nKnopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year\nterm. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will\nbe a $3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more\nrevenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have\nthe book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada,\n18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in\nOctober 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint\ncontract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a\nlarge final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his\nappreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your\nattitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot\nof things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf\nto Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.\n\nCerf never accepted the loss of *The Magic Mountain* and tried\nrepeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical.\nIn 1942, after Mann’s *Buddenbrooks* (285) had also been withdrawn from\nthe ML, Cerf offered a $5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a\ncopy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you”\nfor permission to publish *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant. He added,\n“Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know\nwhy this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back\nthan any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July\n1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is\njust too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on\nany arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the\nnecessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied:\n“I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow\n*Buddenbrooks* into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann\ntitle somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent\nthe best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).\n\n*The Magic Mountain* was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s\nacquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML\nin 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMann, *Buddenbrooks* (1935–1940) 285\n\nMann, Thomas, *Stories of Three Decades* (Giant, 1961–1973; 1979–1986)\nG97\n\nMann, *Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man* (1965–1971) 577\n\nMann, *Doctor Faustus* (1966– ) 582"

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired\nthe Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W.\nDodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and\nBoni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. \\[*1*\\]–557) printed from\nDreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nDreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The\nEarly Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it\nwas rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday,\nPage at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a\nreader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:\n\n> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its\n> frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and\n> because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be\n> withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in\n> circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that\n> the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to\n> insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal\n> adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his\n> share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was\n> legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a\n> contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include\n> *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in\n> the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because\n> no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did\n> manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred\n> of them. (p. vi)\n\n[James L. W. West\nIII](http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html)\nnotes:\n\n> Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a\n> vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read\n> the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For\n> whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the\n> narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish\n> it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw\n> the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication.\n> Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed\n> to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no\n> obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and\n> Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of\n> Pennsylvania Library, 2000).\n\nDoubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450\nunbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456\ncopies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and\nDreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates\nthat the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies\nof *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &\nCompany (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later\npurchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister\nCarrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.\n\nThe ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a\n$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the\nadvance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates\nwhich had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited\nto Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML\nedition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.\nDreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing\nwas required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions\nfor the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s\ndeath the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser\nPapers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).\n\nDreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was\noriginally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s\nNote on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:\n\n> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern\n> Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as\n> much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and\n> spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser,\n> however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements\n> covering the two-fifty edition \\[the trade edition published by Boni &\n> Liveright in 1917\\], and it was only in February, 1932, after more\n> attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us\n> do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.\n\n*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the\n1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies\nby the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of\n$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in\nthe first quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n**230b.

(*Fall 1931*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9\nApril 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. *The Stories of Anton\nTchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories*\n(27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision\nof the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been\nawaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short\nStories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to\nscrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection\nthat we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected\nwith due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the\nfourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s\ncollection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).\n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the\nspelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use\nof “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton\nTchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of\nthat spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to\n“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.\n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth\nof the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.**232b. *Rothschild’s\nFiddle* added (1936?)**Title as 232a.Pp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–x, 1–448\n\\[449–454\\]. \\[1–14\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[15\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 232a except: \\[ii\\] pub. note A6; \\[iv\\] *First* statement\nomitted; 1–448 text; \\[449–453\\] ML list; \\[454\\] ML Giants list.\n(*Spring 1936*) *Note:* “Rothschild’s Fiddle” (in the R. E. C.

Published March 1932. *WR*\n26 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\nPublished in Vintage Books, spring 1967.\n\nCerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the\nML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your\nModern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to\ntake with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE\nFURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the\ntime the book was published, in your list \\[Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,\n*On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,* was published by Cape &\nSmith in 1929\\]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will\nbe a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us\nup.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few\nvolumes. He requested Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*\nand any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books\nin which a Dostoyefsky \\[*sic*\\] influence was found. I have never read\nDostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf,\n15 April 1931).\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to include *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay\nDying*, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type\nwhich had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s\naudience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the\ncost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in\nproduction and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House\nbetween 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for\nbooks without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was\ncheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the\npossibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year\nor so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be\ninstructed to melt the type (Harter, *The Making of William Faulkner’s\nBooks, 1929*–*1939*, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult\nfor reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive\nreprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial\npublication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from\nthe original publisher’s plates.\n\nFaulkner’s next book, *Sanctuary*, had more commercial appeal. It was\nthe only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were\nmade. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback.\nThe American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet\nBooks—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight\nprintings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies\n(Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on\nfront cover).\n\nIn his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he\ninitially wrote *Sanctuary* for money. The introduction begins:\n\n> This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea,\n> because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been\n> writing books for about five years, which got published but not\n> bought. . . .\n>\n> Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in\n> terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of\n> it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in\n> Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought\n> was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could\n> imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)\n\nAfter sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job\nworking the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between\n12 and 4, I wrote *As I Lay Dying* in six weeks, without changing a\nword. I sent it to Smith \\[his publisher\\] and wrote him that by it I\nwould stand or fall.” He continues:\n\n> I think I had forgotten about *Sanctuary*, just as you might forget\n> about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.\n> *As I Lay Dying* was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of\n> *Sanctuary* until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so\n> terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite\n> it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy\n> it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been\n> already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting\n> it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame *The\n> Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* too much and I made a fair\n> job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they\n> will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)\n\nFaulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than\nthe rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be\nreset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees\nBook Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the\nintroduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like\nBurck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when\nE. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger\nformat.\n\nFaulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith &\nHaas. *Sanctuary* remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published together\nin a single volume.\n\n*Sanctuary* sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nFaulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel\nPrize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the\nseries. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in\nterms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952. *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was the fifth\nbest-selling title in the regular ML, followed by *Light in August*\n(429), *Absalom, Absalom!* (434), and *Sanctuary* (233), which sold\n4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in\nthe regular ML.\n\n#### 233.1b.

The earliest use of\nthe uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By\n1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform\njackets.

In\n> *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine\n> and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim\n> and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy.\n> The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality\n> and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, *Tess\n> of the D’Urbervilles* was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is\n> acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last\n> decade of the nineteenth century. (*Fall 1956*)\n\nBibliographical edition originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1920.\nML edition (pp. xxv–\\[xxxiv\\], \\[1\\] – \\[508\\]) printed from offset\nplates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with\nrunning heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s\nWessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular\nML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format,\n1979–86.\n\nWhen plans were made to publish *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* in MLCE,\nStein offered Weber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30\nJune 1950). Weber accepted but added:\n\n> I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of\n> this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first\n> issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED\n> BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an\n> edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier\n> editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s\n> “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent\n> reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text\n> for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what,\n> please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are\n> going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of\n> Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a\n> definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).\n\nStein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920\nedition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport,\nTennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty\nof 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML\nformat, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer.\nThe ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the\nHarper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950).\nThe map was included at Weber’s suggestion.\n\n#### 234.2b.

(*Spring 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Generation after generation of Americans has been brought up on the\n> poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. To him can be attributed a major\n> share of what love for poetry great masses of our people cherish. Such\n> poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles\n> Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our\n> heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for\n> our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great\n> lyricists of our national literature. (*Spring 1938*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nLongfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his\ntime. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when\nLongfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes\nsubstantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at\nHarvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death\nhe received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice\nwhat he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained\nsufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin\nCo., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher,\nTicknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced\nits edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott\nat Houghton Mifflin:\n\n> A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we\n> first noticed your announcement . . . \\[Longfellow is the\\] Poet of\n> Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled\n> at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and\n> office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”\n\nLinscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for\nwhich the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy\nacknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).\n\nThe ML initially intended to base its edition on *The Poems of Henry W.\nLongfellow*, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library\nseries. Linscott wrote again four days later:\n\n> You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow”\n> which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright\n> before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents\n> as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and\n> a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19\n> January 1932).\n\nLinscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete\nCambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.\n\nAt this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton\nMifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant\nfigure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537),\nintervened. He wrote Cerf:\n\n> I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it \\[the\n> Longfellow matter\\]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow\n> material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that\n> poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and\n> have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal\n> relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have\n> tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.\n>\n> Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library\n> cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, *et cetera*, or can\n> you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I\n> believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February\n> 1932)\n\nBoth Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of\nLongfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to\nLinscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932).\nLinscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may\nhave gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the\ncircumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at\npresent” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).\n\nIn the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the\ncopyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include\nnearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.\n\nWhen the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who\nacknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best\nwishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML\nedition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a\nnew typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that\nhad entered the public domain since 1932.\n\n*The Poems of Longfellow* and *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*\n(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic\njacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets\nby 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and\nFranklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by\na pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for *The Poems of\nLongfellow* remained in use until the early 1940s.\n\nCerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s,\nbut it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. *The Poems\nof Longfellow* sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed\nservices. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on\nto its first-quarter ranking.\n\n#### 235.1b.

Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets\nby 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and\nLongfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from\nthis day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press\nunless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both\nthe typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think\nthat the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to\nWilliam Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).\n\nThe Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed\npictorial jacket (jacket B, described above).

Cerf\ninitially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf\nto Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may\nhave been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931\npublication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford\nin Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and\nindicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January\n1932).\n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies\n(July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March\n1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling\n14,000 copies.

It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of\nthe Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf,\n29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *A Farewell to\nArms* was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nedition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.\n\n#### 237b.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nCerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to *Victory*.\nIn 1928 he offered an advance of $3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a\nroyalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to\nNelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do\nappreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is\nunwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21\nDecember 1928). *Victory* was included in the Sun Dial Library published\nby Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that\nspecialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial\nLibrary in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title\nincluded in the series. *Victory* was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial\nLibrary titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\n*Victory* sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Lord Jim* (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales\nof *Victory* totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad\nwas one of the ML’s best-selling authors. *Victory* sold 7,966 copies\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the\ntwelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. *Lord Jim* was the eighth\nbest-selling title.\n\n#### 238b.

(*Spring 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros.,\n1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July\n1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1958.\n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated\ninterest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his\npersonal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself\nhave bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros.,\n5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk\nabout a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September\n1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he\nstated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in\nthe Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and\nI have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the\nauthor’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint\ncontract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a\nwarm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the\nModern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is\nreleased” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).\n\nWhen the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed\nKlopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the\nReaders Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s\npresident, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was\navailable (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and\nconvinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail\norder sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would\nlike to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the\noption to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer\nto Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty\nremained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed\nin 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but\nwithout an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the\nML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club\nedition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).\n\nIn 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in\nadding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349)\nto the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper\ndirector of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the\nML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had\ntextbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer\nreplied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition\nfrom an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department\nwants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the\nModern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to\nRose, 25 July 1956).\n\n*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles\nin the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952.\n\n#### 239b.

The statement on\nthe title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not\nstrictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation\nof “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and\nunabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the\nstories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional\nphrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I\nbelieve it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”\n(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML\nmade three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to\nWalter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the\nbook for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in\nSeptember 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition\nin November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap\nborrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,\npaying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).\n\n*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.

His *Capital and Other Writings*, judiciously and\n> discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a\n> newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the\n> shelf of the Modern Library. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of *Capital*\nand Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint\nof *The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of\n“Capital,”* edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L.\nTrask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML\nedition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until\nOctober because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S.\nThe ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L.\nTrask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and\nit seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic\ntheories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is\nusually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and\n*Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.\n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was\nprominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was\ncompiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy\nencyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of\nMarx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932).\nCerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his\nname may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he\nwould cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The\nLenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent\nParts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally\nprojected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an\nintroduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a\nRussian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by\nLenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark\nmade by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something\ncomplete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this\ntheory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must\nadvance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p.\nxix).\n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and\nOther Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of\nLenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and\nedit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was\ncancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested,\nDeclined” under 1933 for more information.\n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack\nof an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*:\n“I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an\nindex. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which\nKarl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember\nyour obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not\nGroucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that\nSchuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to\nSchuster, 8 February 1933).\n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist\nManifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952\nwith sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The\nCommunist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in\nthe past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).\n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s\n*Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333\ncopies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.\n\n#### 246b.

Through the\n> experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture\n> in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. *Three\n> Soldiers* introduced a writer who has since become a major figure\n> among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests\n> securely. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed\nfrom Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates\nappear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled\nfor November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1963.\n\nEight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday,\nDoran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern\nLibrary, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and\nThree Soldiers.” He asked how many copies *Three Soldiers* had sold in\nthe trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial\nLibrary (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that\nthe plates for *Three Soldiers* were too large for the ML’s format he\ncontacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer* and *The 42nd Parallel*. *Manhattan Transfer* had\nsold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for *The 42nd Parallel* (Henry\nHoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those\ntitles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin\nwith *Three Soldiers* and added *The 42nd Parallel* (307) to the ML five\nyears later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos\nPassos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.\n\nFor *Three Soldiers* the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his\ncorrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know\nif I made more corrections in the *Three Soldiers* text than you can\nhandle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were\njust going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was\naway when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked\nCerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling\ncorrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.\nThe introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was\ndoing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,\nundated).\n\n*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from\nDoubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500\ncopies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20\nAugust 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\nHoughton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.*\n(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality\npaperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination\nagreement in June and instructed the production department to make no\nmore printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June\n1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock\nand asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to\nbring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick\nMoseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated\nthat the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a\nyear, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley,\n22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if\n*Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was\n(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January\n1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that\nyear.\n\n*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after\nfall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the\nend of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The\nBuddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring\n1969 after the oversight was discovered.\n\n#### 248b.

The heavier paper may have been necessary\nbecause of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first\nprinting may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing\nof 8,000 copies and received 7,450.\n\nWhen the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s\nthat it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations\nand asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper &\nBros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the\nwood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the\nplates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s\nballoon-cloth format.\n\n*Peter Ibbetson* sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles.

Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1937; unsigned. Front flap as\njacket A. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nCarlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by\nJ. M. Dent & Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December\n1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and\nsubsequently in Vintage Books.\n\nThe ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of\nreports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from\nHenry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the\ntranslation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice\nFiruski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the\ntranslation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by\nT. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on\nDante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent\nof Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski,\n28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an\nintroduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to\nGrandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.\n\nCerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few\nparagraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932).\nGrandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using\nand knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the\nbest translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher\n(Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an\ninferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the\nTemple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph\nby the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of\nthe English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle,\nThomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is\nclear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be\nreadily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its\nscholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p.\nxiii).\n\nThe Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s\n*Divine Comedy* the best translations have been followed: *Inferno*, by\nJohn Aiken Carlyle; *Purgatorio*, by Thomas Okey; *Paradisio*, by Philip\nH. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim)\nfollow, in the main, the excellent notes for the *Inferno* and the\n*Purgatorio* by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr.\nOeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the *Paradisio*” (251.1, p. 3;\n251.2, p. xvii).\n\nML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to\nthe translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the\ntranslator of *Purgatorio*. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library\n(IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations\nwere not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML\nprintings until 1963/64 (251.2c).\n\nShortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S.\nSingleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of\n*The Divine Comedy* for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working\non a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled\nto be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the\nseven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the\napproval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after\ntheirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances\ntotaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took\nlonger than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years\nlater it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The\nBollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and\n1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary.\nBy that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become\nmoribund and had ceased adding new titles.\n\n*The Divine Comedy* sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant\ntitles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1932 1932 Elmer Adler, who had been a director of Random House since the imprint\nwas created in 1927 to distribute and publish fine limited editions,\nresigned in 1932. Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine\nprinting business, Pynson Printers, and to *The Colophon*, the\nbibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random\nHouse was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library,\nInc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933,\nfollowing the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer\nturned seriously to trade publishing.\n\nML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide\nexceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes\npublished in 1932 sold for $1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages\nper volume.\n\nThe ML published a full-page ad in *Publishers’ Weekly* that lampooned\nthe publishing industry adage, “You can’t sell books like soap.”\nAdapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed “They\nFloat!” and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with\nfive Modern Library books—*Of Human Bondage*, *Swann’s Way*, *The Magic\nMountain*, *Droll Stories*, and *Sanctuary*—floating on the surface of\nthe water (*PW*, 14 May 1932, p. 2015). Twenty-four titles were added and fifteen were discontinued, bringing\nthe number of titles in the regular ML to 207. Six of the discontinued\ntitles (two by Maupassant and four by Wilde) were repackaged as three\nvolumes to offer better value. Chekhov, *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other\nStories*, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more\ncomprehensive collection, *The Stories of Anton Tchekov*, edited by\nRobert Linscott). Three new titles in ML Giants, including Gibbon,\n*Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* in two volumes, brought the\nnumber of Giants to six titles in seven volumes. *Decline and Fall of\nthe Roman Empire* was expanded to three volumes in 1946. All new titles except Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* (230) were published in\nthe standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110\nmm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Sister\nCarrie* was ¼ in. taller.\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type; all but three had torchbearer A2.\nDostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (228) had torchbearer A3; Dos\nPassos, *Three Soldiers* (248) had torchbearer C1; *The Arabian Nights’\nEntertainments* (244) had no torchbearer on the title page. All new\ntitles except *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had the 3-line\nimprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text\nthat there was no room for a torchbearer or Cerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nEighteen of the 1932 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Four were published in uniform typographic jacket D\nand two in uniform typographic jacket F. Nearly all new titles published\nbetween 1932 and the introduction of the ML’s larger format in fall 1939\nhad pictorial jackets. Uniform typographic jacket D was used on newly\npublished titles for the last time in spring 1932. The final examples of\nits use, *Poems of Longfellow* (235) and Franklin, *Autobiography and\nSelections from His Other Writings* (236), provoked an angry letter from\nCerf, who had apparently given instructions that the jacket was no\nlonger to be used for new titles. 95 cents. (Spring) Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* xDickens, *Pickwick Papers*; Giants\nthrough G5. (Fall) Dickens, *Pickwick Papers* xLewis, *Arrowsmith*;\nGiants through G7. Cerf approached Arthur Pell at Liveright, Inc., about including a volume\nof plays by Eugene O’Neill in ML Giants (Cerf to Pell, 16 November\n1932). Nothing came of this initiative. O’Neill became a Random House\nauthor the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O’Neill’s\n*Nine Plays* (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added\nto the Giants in 1941.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens’s *Crock\nof Gold* (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs,\nthe president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the\npresident of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML\nreprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, “We\nare simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a\ncheap edition we would do it ourselves” (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).\n\nCerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge\nplays, saying “If we can’t get this from you by peaceable means in the\nnext two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston\nunderworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with\nlighted matches until you sign on the dotted line” (Cerf to Schaff, 16\nNovember 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to\n*Kim* (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to\nconsider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.\n\nJames Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West,\nsuggested Edmund Wilson’s *Axel’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative\nLiterature of 1870–1930*, which had been published by Charles Scribner’s\nSons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with\nWilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested\nadding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed\npublishing under a new title such as *Literary Essays* or *Essays on\nModern Authors*. He also asked for an advance of $500 (Wilson to Cerf,\n28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays\nhe had considered adding to *Axel’s Castle* into a new book (Wilson to\nCerf, 6 November 1933).\n\nDale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a\none-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm\nof Albert & Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes\ncomprising Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, would welcome some\nready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in\n1930, and the firm “was in major trouble” by the early 1930s (“Albert\nand Charles Boni” in *American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980*,\np. 57).\n\nThe ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, *Swann’s Way* (1928)\nand *Within a Budding Grove* (1930), and would add *Guermantes Way* in\n1933. Cerf thought that Warren’s suggestion was an excellent idea except\nfrom the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked\nWarren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris\nGreenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. “We\nhave had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire\nProust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might\nbe able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that\nanything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as\npossible. Something <u>must</u> break in this situation before the\nsummer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining\nin original). Five months later he indicated, “I have not given up hopes\nof buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything\ndevelops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you\nimmediately” (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure\n*Remembrance of Things Past* a year or so later. The Random House\nedition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf\ndescribed it as “one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934” (Cerf,\n*At Random*, p. 99).\n\nWarren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of\nProust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but\nadded that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust\nif the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather’s *My Antonia*,\nwhich he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to\nWarren, 13 September 1943). Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 228\n\nMann, *Magic Mountain* (1932) 229\n\nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932) 230\n\nStoker, *Dracula* (1932) 231\n\nChekhov, *Stories of Anton Tchekov* (1932–1956), *Stories of Anton\nChekhov* (1957–1963), *Short Stories of Anton Chekhov* (1964– ) 232\n\nFaulkner, *Sanctuary* (1932) 233\n\nHardy, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* (1932) 234\n\nLongfellow, *Poems* (1932–1945), *Poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*\n(1945– ) 235\n\nFranklin, *Autobiography Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other\nWritings* (1932) 236\n\nHemingway, *Farewell to Arms* (1932) 237\n\nConrad, *Victory* (1932) 238\n\nHughes, *High Wind in Jamaica* (1932) 239\n\n*Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays* (1932) 240\n\n***  \nSpring*** Elmer Adler, who had been a director of Random House since the imprint\nwas created in 1927 to distribute and publish fine limited editions,\nresigned in 1932. Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine\nprinting business, Pynson Printers, and to *The Colophon*, the\nbibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random\nHouse was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library,\nInc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933,\nfollowing the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer\nturned seriously to trade publishing. [object Object]"
