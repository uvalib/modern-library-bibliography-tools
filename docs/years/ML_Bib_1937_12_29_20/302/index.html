Now, in the perspective of a quarter of a century, three of his novels,Sons and Lovers(No. 109),The Rainbow(No. 128) andWomen in Love(No. 68), offer the best testimony to clarify his position as a writer who explored the darker labyrinths of the human soul.Women in Love, particularly, is characteristic of Lawrence’s work dealing with the physical and mystical urgency of love.

Many critics in fact believe that it is the most profound investigation of his lifelong preoccupation with the relationships between the sexes and between man and nature. The story of two sisters, Ursula and Gudrun, and their love affairs with Birkin and Gerald, it contrasts the two relationships—Gudrun and Gerald’s, which is icy, sterile and doomed; and Ursula and Birkin’s, which is fruitful and transcendent."
