Front flap: The mastery with which Virginia Woolf has achieved such novels and books of essays asMrs. Dalloway(No. 96),To the Lighthouse,The Common ReaderandA Room of One’s Ownhas at last brought her the public tribute of having a national best-seller inThe Years.To the Lighthouseis in Mrs. Woolf’s best vein, quiet [sic] evocative, full of the interplay of human emotion. In addition, its autobiographicalnotethrows light upon her own family, one of the most illustrious in England. (Fall 1937) Originally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1927.

Total ML sales ofTo the Lighthousewere 38,000 copies (Kirkpatrick,Virginia Woolf, p. 31).To the Lighthousesold 3,203 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles.Mrs. Dalloway(168) sold 4,271 copies during the same period. Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market.
