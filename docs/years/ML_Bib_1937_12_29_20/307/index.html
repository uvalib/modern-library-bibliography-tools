    "When the completed trilogy,U. S. A., of whichThe 42nd Parallelis the introductory novel, will have been published in the Modern Library, John Dos Passos will have gained the distinction of being represented by four titles in the series.Three Soldiers(No. 205), his war novel, has been in active demand for years. Following the publication ofThe 42nd Parallel,1919andThe Big Moneywill be issued in successive seasons. By this plan, John Dos Passos’ original intention of maintaining the unity of the three novels will be fulfilled. (Fall 1937)",
    "Originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1930; rights subsequently acquired by Harcourt, Brace & Co. ML edition ofThe 42nd Parallelprinted from plates made from a new Harcourt, Brace typesetting with revisions by the author. The plates were subsequently used for the one-volume edition ofU.S.A.published by Harcourt, Brace in January 1938 and reprinted in ML Giants in 1939. Published 10 November 1937.WR13 November 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940 after the ML publishedU.S.A.as a Giant (G42).",
    "The ML signed a contract with Harcourt, Brace to publishThe 42nd Parallel,Nineteen Nineteen, andThe Big Moneyin the regular ML in the fall seasons of 1937, 1938, and 1939 (Cerf to Dos Passos, 23 June 1937). The ML appears to have offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for each volume. Cerf indicated after signing the reprint contract, “I am really delighted that we are going to have these books in the Modern Library. John Dos Passos is exactly the kind of author that we can sell in this series” (Cerf to Donald Brace, 13 May 1937).",
    "Harcourt, Brace resetThe 42nd Parallel, incorporating corrections of a large number of typographical errors submitted by Dos Passos. The ML edition was the first printing from the new typesetting. Dos Passos had also made extensive revisions for the ML edition ofThree Soldiers(248).",
    "Cerf asked Dos Passos to write a short foreword to the ML edition ofThe 42nd Parallel, noting that he believed his foreword to the ML edition ofThree Soldiers(248) “materially helped the sale of the book.” He offered the usual $50 fee with the apology that the ML couldn’t afford more but enclosed a ML list and invited Dos Passos to select any books he wanted (Cerf to Dos Passos, ibid.). Dos Passos eventually selected about a hundred titles. He promised to send a short introduction and noted, “I’m not quite sure whether this is the time to spill the fact that the narratives will be collected into a one volume novel under the name ofU.S.A.or not” (Dos Passos to Cerf, 4 July 1937).",
    "The introduction to the ML edition, dated July 1937, begins:",
    "The 42nd Parallelis the first volume ofU. S. A., a long narrative which deals with the more or less entangled lives of a number of Americans during the first three decades of the present century. The volumes that follow are called1919andThe Big Money.",
    "In an effort to take in as much as possible of the broad field of the lives of these times, three separate sequences have been threaded in and out among the stories. Of theseThe Camera Eyeaims to indicate the position of the observer andNewsreelto give an inkling of the common mind of the epoch. Portraits of a number of real people are interlarded in the pauses in the narrative because their lives seem to embody so well the quality of the soil in which Americans of these generations grew.",
    "This method was used with the idea of coping with the particular job in hand rather than from any generalized theory about novelwriting [sic]. In fact I don’t think any such theory holds water. The shape of a piece of work should be imposed, and in a good piece of work always is imposed, by the matter. That’s more or less of a commonplace of a considerable body of literary criticism.",
    "The ML later renegotiated the reprint contract so that the trilogy could appear as a Giant rather than separate volumes in the regular ML.U.S.A.(G42) was published as a Giant in February 1939, andThe 42nd Parallelwas discontinued as a separate volume in fall 1940.",
