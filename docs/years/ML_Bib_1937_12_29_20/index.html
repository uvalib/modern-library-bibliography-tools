Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some dusty shelf in the rear.

This is not a clever introduction” (Steinbeck to Cerf, undated but probably June 1937). He also asked that the ML edition be dedicated to Susan Gregory of Monterey.
