    "Long beforeOf Mice and Menbecame a best-seller and thrust its author into the national limelight, John Steinbeck had built a solid reputation upon his novel,Tortilla Flat. This carefree tale of the exploits of three lovable rogues won the unanimous praise of critics and reading public alike. Now it is included in the Modern Library series, partly as a tribute to the novel’s own enchantment and partly because John Steinbeck has earned the right to a place in a library of the foremost writers of our time. (Fall 1937)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Covici, Friede, 1935; publishing rights and plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. v–[317]) printed from Covici, Friede (later Covici, Friede/Viking) plates. Published September 1937.WR25 September 1937. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "Steinbeck’s foreword begins: “When this book was written, it did not occur to me that paisanos were curious or quaint, dispossessed or underdoggish. They are people whom I know and like, people who merge successfully with their habitat. . . . Had I known that these stories and these people would be considered quaint, I think I never should have written them” (p. [i]). When he submitted the foreword he told Cerf, “It is the only thing I want to say. If it won’t do—throw it out and have someone else do it. This is not a clever introduction” (Steinbeck to Cerf, undated but probably June 1937). He also asked that the ML edition be dedicated to Susan Gregory of Monterey. The dedication was retained in later Viking printings.",
    "Subsequent printings of the ML edition include the following: 3,000 copies (August 1938); 3,000 copies (July 1939); 5,000 copies (December 1939); 2,000 copies (July 1941); 6,000 copies (December 1942).Tortilla Flatsold 13,432 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the fourth best-selling title in the regular series and thirteenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. The unusually strong sales ofTortilla Flatat this period may have been stimulated by the release of the 1942 film version starring Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr.",
    "During the same periodThe Grapes of Wrath(341) ranked in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 9,495 copies.Of Mice and Men(311) andIn Dubious Battle(322) were in the second quarter with sales of 7,020 copies and 6,028 copies respectively. By the early 1950s (November 1951–October 1952)The Grapes of Wrathwas the only Steinbeck title among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.",

    "Tortilla Flat, which appeared in 1935, was the first of Steinbeck’s novels to receive wide attention. He was disturbed by the response to this portrait of a group of carefreepaisanosin a Monterey slum, writing two years later that “I shall never again subject to the vulgar touch of thedecentthese good people of laughter and kindness, of honest lusts and direct eyes, of courtesy beyond politeness.” If today, Steinbeck’s own view of Danny and his friends seems to some shallow and condescending, that is a measure of the time in which he wrote and the impact of his writing on the change in our attitudes. Steinbeck tells this story with warmth and liveliness, and it remains a document of a period when even this glimpse of a different slice of life could be considered shocking.",
