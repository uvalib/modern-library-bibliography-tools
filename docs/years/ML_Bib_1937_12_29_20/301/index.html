    "Of all the historical novels of recent times, none has found such widespread public response as Robert Grave’s reconstruction of the grandeur and folly and fantastic sensuality of Imperial Rome. The mild Claudius, moving unobtrusively among his sinister relatives and recording their proud and vile history, unfolds a panorama of weird intrigue and startling events. Poison, blasphemy, incest, black magic and unnatural vice flourish with a fine disdain for the good opinion of history. Such worthies as Caligula, Nero and Messalina come to life in a book as historically accurate as it is enthralling. (Spring 1937)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934. ML edition (301.1) printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1937.WR27 February 1937. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; restored to ML 1982.",
    "The Smith and Haas typesetting was too large for the ML’s format and included a folding genealogical table of the Imperial family that was omitted from the ML edition. By reducing the type size the ML was able produce a volume that was 67 pages shorter than the Smith and Haas edition. The ML plates were also used for a Grosset & Dunlap printing which retained the biographical note (p. [v]) written for the ML.",

    "Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus lived from 10 B.C. to A.D. 54. Despised as a weakling and considered an idiot because of his physical infirmities, Claudius survived the intrigues and poisonings of the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and the mad Caligula to become emperor in A.D. 41.I, Claudius, written in the form of Claudius’ autobiography, unfolds a panorama of startling events in this scandalous era. Violence, blasphemy, incest, black magic and vice flourish with a fine disdain for the good opinion of history in a book that is one of the classics of modern fiction, and the best fictional reconstruction of Rome ever written.",
