In these exciting stories, from Bret Harte and Mark Twain to Walter Van Tilburg Clark, the reader will find outstanding contributions by the authors who broke the ground for innumerable other writers. This collection is designed to follow the development of the Western short story, and it captures the adventurous spirit of the cowboy, the two-gun man, the desert prospector, the gambler, the dance-hall girl, the cattle rustler, the miner, the builder and the nester—all pioneers of the American West.

The Pocket Books edition, published in June 1945 and printed from plates made from a different typesetting, ran to 320 pages, forty pages shorter than the ML edition. It omitted Robert Easton’s “To Find a Place” (ML ed., pp. 331–61) but the content of the two editions was otherwise identical. The composition and manufacturing costs for each set of plates was split equally between Pocket Books and the ML. Maule, a RH editor, received a $250 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy on the ML edition."

      "#text": "Hal Borland’s review of the ML edition in theNew York Times Book Reviewnoted the absence of Will James, Andy Adams, and B. M. Bower. Maule had tried to get something by James but the estate was tied up with legal problems and had been unable to grant permission. Adams and Bower wrote no short stories and Maule did not want to include selections from novels. In a letter to Borland he noted, “There is another omission which we are correcting because the Modern Library feels that the permanence of the volume justifies the trouble and expense. Through a mix-up I failed to include a WOLFVILLE story by Alfred Henry Lewis but I am in touch with the estate now, and the next printing will have one” (Maule to Borland, 3 July 1945)."
