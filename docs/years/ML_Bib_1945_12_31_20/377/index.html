Typographic design by Joseph Blumenthal; illustration signed: WS [William Sharp]. Front flap: In selecting thirty-eight of the more than 600 stories written by O. Henry, the editors of this volume first chose those honored unanimously by anthologists and then added several of special interest. The most exacting present-day standards were applied as the final test of admission, with the result that this collection in the truest sense represents America’s favorite story-teller at his mellow, humorous and ironic best. It is with such stories as these that O. Henry earned a permanent place beside the world’s great masters of the short story. (Spring 1945) Front flap revised: The more than 600 stories written by O. Henry provided an embarrassment of riches for the compilers of this volume. Within the scope of a book of 338 pages, they were guided in their choice by the most exacting present-day standards of admission. The final selection of the thirty-eight stories in this collection offers for the reader’s delight those tales honored almost unanimously by anthologists and those which represent, in variety and balance, the best work of America’s favorite story-teller. They are tales in his most mellow, humorous and ironic moods. They give the full range and flavor of the man, born William Sidney Porter, but known throughout the world as O. Henry, one of the great masters of the short story. (Spring 1957) Originally published by Sun Dial Press, an imprint of Doubleday, Doran & Co. 1945. ML edition (pp. v–338) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published April 1945.WR5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. The Best Short Stories of O. Henrywas a joint venture between the ML and Doubleday, Doran. Van H. Cartmell, who collaborated with Cerf in the 1940s in editing four anthologies of plays that were published in ML Giants, was an associate editor at Doubleday, Doran and editor-in-chief of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary, Garden City Publishing Co. The Sun Dial Press edition appeared first, followed shortly by the ML edition. Doubleday, Doran made the plates, and the ML paid Doubleday a $2,000 advance (including $100 as a plate rental for five years) against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Ray Freiman, the Random House art director, authorized Sharp to use full color in the jacket illustration. He also asked him to include a hansom cab in the background (Freiman to Sharp, 14 December 1944). The ML printed 20,000 jackets in February 1945. The first printing was probably 20,000 as well. Royalties increased by 1971 to 14 cents a copy.The Best Short Stories of O. Henrysold 3,850 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. The Best Short Stories of O.
