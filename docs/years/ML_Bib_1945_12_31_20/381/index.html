Contents as 381a except: [iv] Copyright, 1936, by Random House, Inc. (Fall 1945)Note:The correction in the copyright date was made because Hart’s introduction was initially written for the limited edition ofTwo Years before the Mastprinted by the Grabhorn Press in San Francisco and published by Random House in 1936. JacketA:Pictorial in dark blue (183) and medium gray (264) on coated cream paper with inset multi-color illustration adapted from the poster for the 1946 film version starring Alan Ladd and Brian Donlevy; lettering in dark blue on medium gray panels above and below illustration; all surrounded by dark blue background. Front flap: The test of time by which classics are proved has certainly been applied to Richard Henry Dana’sTwo Years Before the Mast, for it is now just over one hundred years since it was first published. During that century it has constantly risen in the admiration of succeeding generations of readers, and today is as revered as a masterpiece of the literature of the sea as it ever has been in all its long history. It takes an honored place in the Modern Library series, introduced by James Hart of Harvard University. (Spring 1945)Note:There was a second printing. Jacket B1:Pictorial on cream paper in light blue (181), light yellow 86), light orange yellow (70) and black with inset illustration of clipper ship at dock and title and author in reverse against light blue background and series in black. Front flap as jacket A. (Spring 1946)  Flap: “James D. Hart of the University of California” fall 1948; “of Harvard University” fall 1954 sans serif type, later corrected (F55) ML edition based on the text of the limited edition of 1,000 copies printed by Edwin and Robert Grabhorn in San Francisco and published by Random House, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published summer1945 (publication originally announced for fall 1944 and then for spring 1945).WR4 August 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. James D. Hart, the author of the Foreword, had suggested a ML edition ofTwo Years before the Mastin 1935 and indicated that it would have a steady sale to schools and colleges (Hart to Cerf, 19 February 1935). Later that year Cerf offered Hart $75 to write an introduction to the Grabhorn Press edition with the understanding that the introduction could also be used in due course in a ML edition (Cerf to Hart, 12 November 1935). Hart also advised Edwin and Robert Grabhorn about the best edition to use as a copy-text when setting their edition. Hart stated in his introduction to the Grabhorn edition, “The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life, and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote ‘twenty-four years after.’ To this have been added the concluding chapter of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p. [xiv]). The second sentence is altered in ML ed. as follows: “To this have been added the preface and epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p. [xiv]). The preface appears in both the Grabhorn and ML editions; the epilogue (titled “Concluding Memorandum” in the Grabhorn edition) appears on pp. 413–23 of the ML edition as part of “Twenty-four Years After.” The concluding chapter referred to in Hart’s introduction to the Grabhorn edition is omitted from 381a. The ML edition also omitted the penultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding chapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided incorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the events as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I shall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have been suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4). The film ofTwo Years before the Maststarring Alan Ladd was released by Paramount Pictures in April 1945. It is possible that publication of the ML edition was postponed to coincide with the release of the film. Thelast paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381a reads as follows: The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote “twenty-four years after.” To this have been added the preface and the epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the original purpose of his account. (p. xiv) Two Years before the Mastwas not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. 381b.  “Concluding Chapter” added (1954) Title as 381a. Pp. [i–iv] v–xvii [xviii], [1–2] 3–443 [444–446].  [1]16[2–7]32[8]8[9]16 Contents as 381a variant through p. 386; 387‑406: CONCLUDING CHAPTER; 3–406 text; [407] part title: TWENTY-FOUR YEARS | AFTER; [408] blank; 409–443 TWENTY-FOUR YEARS AFTER signed p. 443: R. H. D., Jr. | Boston,May6, 1869.; [444–446] blank.

(Fall 1966) Jacket B2:As 381a jacket B except flap text as jacket B except for last sentence. (Fall 1954)Note:The ML began using sans serif type on the flaps and back panel of jackets in fall 1953. When the jacket forTwo Years before the Mastwas reset in sans serif type, the ML’s printers appear to have copied the flap text from jacket A, and the last sentence reverts to “James D. Hart of Harvard University.” (Fall 1954). Jacket B3:As jacket B2 with flap text corrected to “James D. Hart of the University of California.” (Fall 1955) Jacket B4: As jacket B3 except on coated white paper. (Spring 1957) Thelast paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381b is revised as follows: The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote “twenty-four years after.” As preface and epilogue there have been appended the original opening of Chapter I and the Concluding Chapter of the first edition. These sections were omitted in later revisions but they have great value in giving further insight into the purposes of Dana’s book. (p. xiv) The earliest printing examined with the Concluding Chapter (pp. 387–406) has a fall 1954 jacket, but the Concluding Chapter may have been added earlier."
