Cerf’s next step was to offer Pocket Books a $4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised to do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to Commager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months for everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an introduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer indicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and royalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962)."

They are tales in his most mellow, humorous and ironic moods. They give the full range and flavor of the man, born William Sidney Porter, but known throughout the world as O. Henry, one of the great masters of the short story. ("

The ML edition also omitted the penultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding chapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided incorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the events as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I shall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have been suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4)."
