    "It is almost a hundred years sinceDead Soulswas written. During that time it has made a permanent place for itself in the world’s literature beside such books asGulliver’s TravelsandDon Quixote. To the Russian, whatever his political allegiance may be,Dead Soulsis more than a satire that flays the weakness of the Slavic character; it is the enduring symbol of a people that neither tyranny nor revolution can change. Gogol’s masterpiece lends new distinction to the Modern Library list. (Spring 1936)",
    "Constance Garnett translation originally published in U.S. as vols. 1–2 ofThe Collected Works of Nikolay Gogolby Alfred A. Knopf, 1923. ML edition (290.1, pp. [7]–275; [5]–265) printed from Knopf plates with page numerals removed from translator’s preface. Published March 1936.WR28 March 1936. First printing: 5,000 copies. Superseded 1965 by Guerney translation (290.2).",
    "Herschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co., asked in 1931 whyDead Soulswasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead Souls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to it. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf, undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). The ML edition was published five years later.",
    "The ML edition (290.1) was translated by Constance Garnett. Garnett was named on the title page of other classics of Russian literature published in the ML before the 1960s. The only clue to the translator’s identity inDead Soulsis the copyright notice on the verso of the title page, where she is identified as “Mrs. Edward Garnett.” Odets received $50 for the introduction (Cerf to Odets, 16 January 1936).",
    "Dead Soulssold 3,557 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
