Front flap: It is a matter of publishing history that two distinguished novels—Of Human BondageandMaurice Guest—have had an almost parallel fate. Both were acclaimed by discriminating critics but at first met with an apathetic public response. Years later they came into their own as two of the most popular novels of our time. TodayMaurice Guestis ranked, among musical novels, withJean ChristopheandEvelyn Innes, and has grown so steadily in esteem that it is surpassing Henry Handel Richardson’s best-selling novel,Ultima Thule. (Fall 1936) Originally published in U.S. by P. R. Reynolds, 1908, and Duffield & Co., 1909, probably using printed sheets or duplicate plates of the English edition published by William Heinemann, 1908. New bibliographical edition published by W. W. Norton & Co., 1930. ML edition (pp. [1]–566) printed from Norton plates. Published October 1936.WR31 October 1936. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940. A ML edition ofMaurice Guestwas suggested by at least two people. The ML’s traveler for the Middle West passed along a bookseller’s suggestion for the novel (James L. Crowder to Cerf, 1 October 1934), and W. W. Norton appears to have suggested a ML reprint. Cerf expressed reservations about its sales potential: “May I ask you on what terms you will be prepared to let us publish MAURICE GUEST in the Modern Library this Fall? I agree with you that it is a fine book, but am a little doubtful as to just how big a seller it would be” (Cerf to Walter Norton, W. W. Norton & Co., 2 January 1936). Henry Handel Richardson was the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson. Commins identified the author as Henrietta Richardson in the first draft of his biographical note and indicated that “Handel” had been taken from the name of the composer. Norton asked Cerf to omit the reference since neither Norton nor Heinemann, her English publisher, had ever made Richardson’s identity public. He also pointed out that she had been married for over thirty years to an important figure in English letters (the philologist John George Robertson) and was no longer Miss Richardson (Norton to Cerf, 28 July 1936). Commins left in the reference to “Miss Richardson” but omitted information about to her real name. The ML edition was not a success. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.",
