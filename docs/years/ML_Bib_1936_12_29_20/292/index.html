(Spring 1936) Jacket:Pictorial in moderate yellowish green (136) and black on cream paper depicting a stone bridge over a river with trees and cathedral in background; borders in moderate yellowish green, lettering in black except “and the WARDEN” in reverse against moderate yellowish green background. Jacket title: Barchester Towers and The Warden. Signed: illegible. Front flap: The only quarrel among Trollope enthusiasts revolves around the preference betweenBarchester TowersandThe Warden. The editors of the Modern Library serve both factions by including the two novels in a single volume, not so much to placate the embattled Trollopians, but becauseBarchester Towersis, by the author’s own intention, inseparable fromThe Warden, and is its sequel. A. Edward Newton, author ofThe Amenities of Book-Collectingand founder of The Trollope Society, contributes a glowing introduction to this volume. (Spring 1936) ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1936.WR16 May 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Cerf wrote to Newton after the announcement of ML’s spring list: “I am amazed and delighted at the interest that has been evinced at the mere announcement of the first Trollope title in our Modern Library series. We have announced the book for May publication, but it seems if we can get it ready five or six weeks before that time, we may be able to bag a few big school orders for the book. Accordingly, I would esteem it a tremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in the course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of February. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get all the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January 1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML edition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date of the 25th of the month. The Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily accessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped that an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It appeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER TOWERS are published under the patronage of The Trollope Society” (p. [iv]). Klopfer expressed the hope that the ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer to Newton, 12 March 1936). But sales were disappointing and no further works by Trollope were added to the series untilThe Way We Live Now(639) appeared in 1984. Barchester Towers & The Wardensold 3,196 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. 292b.

(Spring 1954) Printings with Hatcher introduction originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Hatcher received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Hatcher, 2 February 1950). Stein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write the introduction. Haight declined on the grounds that he didn’t have time, but he strongly urged that George Eliot’sMiddlemarchbe added to the ML and indicated that he would write an introduction to that (Haight to Stein, 26 January 1950). Haight suggested that Stein contact his colleague Chauncey B. Tinker, but Tinker also declined, as did Mary Ellen Chase (Stein to Tinker, 26 January 1950; Tinker to Stein, 27 January 1950; Stein to Chase, 27 January 1950). Hatcher was the fourth person that Stein contacted. Also in the Modern Library Trollope,Eustace Diamonds(1947–1959)  399 Trollope,The Way We Live Now(1984– )  639"
