Confronted with an embarrassment of riches in making a choice among so many novels, this selection was made because it most completely embodies the spirit and substance of Henry James’ unique gifts. The recognition given him by discriminating readers during the last part of the nineteenth century promises to be renewed in the twentieth. (Spring 1936) Originally published in U.S. by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1881. ML edition (291.1, pp. [7]–[428]; [1]–[438]) printed from Houghton Mifflin plates. Published April 1936.WR25 April 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissued 1983. WhenDaisy Miller & An International Episode(60) was discontinued in 1934, the ML was left with a single James volume,Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master(189). Klopfer then contacted Houghton Mifflin: “It occurred to me that it is just about time for us to get a decent Henry James title in the Modern Library.” He expressed interest inThe Portrait of a LadyorThe Tragic Museprovided the plates fit the ML’s format and offered royalties of 10 cents a copy (Klopfer to Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 6 June 1934). Linscott replied that nothing could be done for a year. Houghton Mifflin had just concluded “a long and difficult negotiation” with the James family to bring out a less expensive edition ofThe Portrait of a Lady, and Ferris Greenslet, general manager of the trade department, did not want to undertake another campaign just then (Linscott to Klopfer, 11 June 1934). Three years after the ML edition was published, Linscott showed Klopfer the Houghton Mifflin sales figures forThe Portrait of a Ladyfor the preceding twelve years (Linscott to Klopfer, 23 May 1939). The figures illustrate the effect of the ML edition on sales of the original publisher’s edition: 510 copies (1927), 509 copies (1928), 400 copies (1929), 402 copies (1930), 309 copies (1931), 192 copies (1932), 112 copies (1933), 155 copies (1934), 158 copies (1935), 93 copies (1936, when the ML edition appeared), 82 copies (1937), 89 copies (1938). The Portrait of a Ladysold 4,308 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales increased by the early 1950s. It sold 5,345 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it thirty-ninth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML. 291.1b.

Front flap reset with last seven words replaced by the following: “. . . grew through the first half of the twentieth and bids fair to be increased considerably in the second.” (Spring 1955) Originally published with Millett’s introduction and bibliography in MLCE, 1951, and subsequently in the regular ML. Stein offered Millett $200 to write an introduction of 3,000–5,000 words (Stein to Millett, 28 June 1950). Millett submitted an essay two-and-a-half times the length requested and indicated that Stein could cut it (Millett to Stein, 3 October 1950). The first part was a sketch of James’s life and works, the second part provided an account of the writing of the novel and James’s opinion of it at various times, and the third part consisted of a critical discussion of the work in light of James’s own criteria and the expectations of the modern reader. Both Stein and Linscott (who had moved to RH from Houghton Mifflin in 1944) were enthusiastic about the introduction but thought it had to be cut. Stein suggested leaving part 3 largely as it stood, cutting part 1 from 3,000 to 1,000 words, and eliminating most of part 2. He urged Millett to publish the entire essay in a journal likeKenyon RevieworSewanee Review(Millett to Stein, 3 October 1950; Millett to Stein 12 October 1950; Stein to Millett, 25 October 1950). Millett does not appear to have published the complete version of his essay. His introduction to the ML edition is the only entry by Millett recorded in Marion Richmond, “Henry James’sThe Portrait of a Lady: A Bibliography of Primary Material and Annotated Criticism,”Henry James Review7 (Winter–Spring 1986, pp. 164–195). 291.2a.

(Fall 1966) Jacket:Fujita jacket in deep orange yellow (69), strong red (12), dark grayish brown (62) and black on coated white paper with author and title in deep orange yellow and strong red within an oval picture frame in dark grayish brown highlighted in deep orange yellow; other lettering in black, all against white background. Front flap: Portrait of a Ladywas first published in 1881. The text reprinted here is the final version, revised by James for the definitive New York Edition of his works. The Portrait of a Ladyis considered James’s first major novel. It is his most thorough and finest exploration to that time of a theme that held his imagination: the impact of the older European civilization on the American character. In Isabel Archer, the American girl who “affronts her destiny” in Europe, James created one of the more enduring and subtle literary portrayals of women.The Portraitis recognized as a triumph of James’s method of psychological realism. Millett’s introduction and bibliography are revised, and James’s preface is added. 291.2b  Reissue format; Millett introduction and bibliography dropped (1983) HENRY JAMES | [2-line title in reverse within single rules in reverse all on black rectangular panel] THE PORTRAIT | OF A LADY | [below panel] THE NEW YORK EDITION | [torchbearer N] | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK Pp.

Jacket:Pictorial in deep reddish orange (36) and black on kraft paper with inset woodcut illustration by Stephen Alcorn of woman in hat. Front flap: Regarded by F. R. Leavis as the greatest achievement in the whole of James’s work,The Portrait of a Ladyexplores a theme and moral dilemma that captivated James’s imagination: the perilous allure of the older European civilization and its impact on the American character. Through the finely drawn figure of Isabel Archer, “a certain young woman affronting her destiny” in Europe, and his mastery of interpersonal relationships to objectify her maturing moral sense, James has produced a triumph of psychological realism that fulfills his own demands of the art form by being both “interesting” and “amusing.” In an exquisite prose style—sensitive, subtle, and perfectly controlled—The Portrait of a Ladyis one of the most enduring representations of women in Western literature, and ranks as one of the finest novels written in the English language. The Portrait of a Ladywas first published in 1881. The text reprinted here is the final version, revised by James for the definitive New York Edition of his works in 1908, and includes his famous Preface. Published spring 1983 at $8.95.
