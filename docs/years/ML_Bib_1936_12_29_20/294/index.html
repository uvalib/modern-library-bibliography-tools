Signed: Cassens. Front flap: No writer of our time has so vividly dramatized the living spirit of revolution, nor so completely identified himself with the struggle for a new social order as André Malraux.Man’s Fate, dealing with the 1925–1927 uprising in China, is, indeed, more than a novel of the fierce conflicts that tore a vast country asunder; it is a revelation of man’s courage and heroism in the face of imminent annihilation. Winner of the Goncourt Prize for 1933,Man’s Fateestablished André Malraux as one of the leading novelists of France and the world. (Fall 1936) Chevalier translation originally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934, two years before Random House acquired the firm. ML edition (294a, pp. [7]–360) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Smith and Haas edition with page numerals “v–vi” removed from contents pages; 294b–c (pp. v–360) printed letterpress from Smith and Haas/RH plates; 294d printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Smith and Haas edition. Published September 1936.WR26 September 1936. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74. Published in Vintage Books, February 1969. Man’s Fatewas the first Smith and Haas title added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer absorbed the firm in April 1936. The Smith and Haas edition measured 8⅜ x 5¾ inches with a type page of 6⅜ by 3⅝ inches. The plates were far too large for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch format. To includeMan’s Fatein the series the ML would either have to reset the text and make new letterpress plates or photograph a clean copy of the Smith and Haas edition, reduce the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography. The quality of offset lithographic printing in the 1930s was inferior to letterpress and the cost of each print run was higher, but photographing an existing book was significantly cheaper than making a new typesetting. There were at least two printings of 294a from offset plates, including a September 1939 printing of 3,000 copies. The introduction of the larger ML format in fall 1939 made it possible, with uncomfortably narrow margins, to use the original letterpress plates for subsequent ML printings (294b–c). With a top margin that averaged about ¼ in. (6 mm), letterpress printings in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s were not examples of fine bookmaking. The ML reverted to offset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing dropped below that of letterpress.Man’s Fateis the only ML title to have been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress, and again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are photographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making printings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of comfortable margins and freshness of the type. The ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or to Gallimard, the French publisher ofLa Condition humaine. Man’s Fatesold 3,376 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles.Man’s Hope(G56), Malraux’s other novel in the ML, sold 2,143 copies during the same period.Man’s Fatedid not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. 294b.

(Fall 1960) Chevalier’s introduction was written for the Smith and Haas edition. Its rhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the 1950s: In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks, no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading, working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . . There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3) Those of us who demand this can now point toMan’s Fateand say: ‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4). Chevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer hearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it was made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the hearings. 294d.
