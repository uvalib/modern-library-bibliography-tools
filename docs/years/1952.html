<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1952</h1>
<h2>1952</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Two emerging trends shaped directions for the Modern Library in 1952:
growth in the quality paperback market and initiatives by publishers to
discontinue contracts with the Modern Library for reprint permissions.</p>
<p>Intimations of the developments in paperback publishing reached Random
House in September 1952. Jess Stein, who came to Random House after the
war to work on <em>The American College Dictionary</em> and stayed to work with
reference books and college texts, was the first to alert Random House
of the implications of this development. He alerted Lewis Miller in the
following memo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I now have a little more information about the Doubleday paperbacks
which were the subject of the rumor I heard yesterday. This new series
apparently will appear in April with 12 titles and prices will range
from 65¢ to 95¢. The type of material in these books will be the kind
that usually appears in the Mentor series (Stein, Memorandum to
Miller, 18 September 1952).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doubleday and Charles Scribner’s Sons were two of the publishing houses
that withdrew reprint contracts for some of the best titles in the
Modern Library during 1952. The Scribner’s withdrawal was especially
difficult for the Modern Library, since the titles were the best-known
works of Ernest Hemingway. The firm had decided to promote its backlist
more vigorously. When plans were made to issue Hemingway’s works in a
uniform edition, Scribner’s decided to terminate the Modern Library’s
reprint contracts.</p>
<p>Cerf was dismayed at the news. Losing Hemingway from the Modern Library
was an unwelcome prospect. As Klopfer stated later, “The Modern Library
has enormous prestige as a series of literary books and there are very
few living American authors who deserve to be included in it, and
certainly Ernest Hemingway belongs there” (Klopfer to Darrow, 13 July
1954).</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Eight titles were added and six were discontinued, bringing titles in
the list to 290.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the
stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s
endpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth
with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue,
red or green) on the spine and front cover. The top edge was stained to
match the inset panels on the spine and front cover.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>$1.25.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Dinesen, <em>Out of Africa</em> xCooper, <em>The Pathfinder</em>; Giants
through G75 with G54 <em>Anthology of Famous British Stories</em>; jackets:
360. (Fall) Cooper, <em>The Pathfinder</em> xGunther, <em>Death Be Not Proud</em>;
Giants through G76 (=spring 1953); jackets: 362.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf tried unsuccessfully to secure reprint rights to two Scribner
titles. He wanted to publish a ML edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s
<em>Tender is the Night</em> (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, 10 April 1952). He also
wanted to include a book by John Galsworthy in the series but was not
interested in any of the titles that Scribner’s were willing to
consider.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Ben Jonson considered John Donne the first among the poets of his
time. That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been
reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life
ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St.
Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons
which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily
wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by
Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry
and a generous selection of his prose. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s <em>Complete Poetry
and Selected Prose</em>, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed
from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. <em>WR</em> 5
April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>The ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from
Nonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein
to Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The
ML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore
more economical to print.</p>
<p><em>The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne</em> was originally
scheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition
was postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of
$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an
additional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.
Stein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in
the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a
number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being
carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John
Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they
have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high
for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College
Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue
getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a
disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production
aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever
before. (Stein to Coffin, 15 May 1951)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A volume of Donne’s <em>Poetry and Prose</em>, ed. Frank J. Warnke, finally
appeared in MLCE in 1967.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Until this century, John Donne’s poetry was excluded from the
mainstream of English literature. To his friend Ben Jonson he was
“first poet in the world for some things,” but “for not keeping of
accent deserved hanging.” Dr. Johnson and Dryden, each a cultural
arbiter of his time, shared a low opinion of Donne’s work: according
to Dryden, he “affects the metaphysics . . . in his amorous verses,
where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair
sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their
hearts, and entertain them with the softness of love.”</p>
<p>But in the first three decades of this century Donne was the poet,
more than any other, to whom British and American poets turned for
inspiration in language and sensibility. This volume contains all of
Donne’s poetry and a substantial selection from his letters and
sermons, with a critical and biographical introduction by Charles M.
Coffin. <em>Note:</em> Ellipses in original.</p>

beauty. She makes the strange ways of the country and its natives part
of the reader’s own discovery and experience. Isak Dinesen’s remote
farm cultivated far more than its coffee crop; it became identified
with a rich personality as sensitive to the primitive people and the
animal life of the Ngong Hills as it was to the ideas that stirred the
outside world. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Out of Africa</em> has perhaps brought more Western readers who have
never visited that continent closer to it than any other book. With
classic simplicity and a painter’s feeling for atmosphere and detail,
Isak Dinesen (Baroness Karen Blixen) tells of the years she spent from
1914 to 1931 managing a coffee plantation in Kenya. Her adventures on
safaris, expeditions to Nairobi, her roles as doctor to her neighbors
and as hostess to strange guests, reveal a personality as sensitive to
the primitive people and the animal life of the Ngong Hills as it was
to the ideas that stirred the outside world. “When you have caught the
rhythm of Africa,” she wrote, “you find that it is the same in all her
music.” The natives, the mountains, the wildlife and trees, all were
“different expressions of one idea, variations upon the same theme.”
From the vast plains where the wild beasts roam to the snows of
Kilimanjaro, from the foothills with the forest behind them to the
dry-low country, the home of the giraffe and rhino, <em>Out of Africa</em> is
a vibrant re-creation of the beauties of the African landscape and the
ways of the land and its people.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The modern theatre keeps a favorite place in its repertory for such
eighteenth-century plays as Gay’s <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em>, Goldsmith’s
<em>She Stoops to Conquer</em> and Sheridan’s <em>The Rivals</em>. Their gaiety, wit
and charm make them as enjoyable to us as the latest Broadway hits.
Equally appealing, though less frequently produced nowadays, are the
other five plays in this volume. All of them make superb reading and
offer great rewards from the treasury of eighteenth-century drama.

Textual note on p. [iv]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first
editions, except <em>The London Merchant</em> (sixth edition, 1735), <em>She
Stoops to Conquer</em> (fifth edition, 1773), and <em>The Rivals</em> (third
edition, 1776)—these exceptions being made because the later editions
show changes reliably believed to have been made by the authors.</p>
<p>A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early
editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in
spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small
number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.</p>

This volume of eighteenth-century plays includes three of the foremost
comedies of the period—<em>The Beggar’s Opera</em> by Gay, <em>She Stoops to
Conquer</em> by Goldsmith and <em>The Rivals</em> by Sheridan. Their biting wit
and satire, combined with elements of farce, have made them enduring
classics. Also included are five lesser-known plays of the period—two
examples of early domestic tragedies: <em>Jane Shore</em> by Rowe and <em>The
London Merchant</em> by Lillo; an early sentimental comedy: <em>The Conscious
Lovers</em> by Steele; a pseudo-classical tragedy: <em>Cato</em> by Addison; and
a burlesque heroic tragedy: <em>The Tragedy of Tragedies</em> by Fielding.
All eight plays offer a comprehensive collection of eighteenth-century
drama. Ricardo Quintana, of the University of Wisconsin English
Department, contributes an informative and penetrating introduction.</p>

<p>Statement on p. [iv]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text followed in this abridgement is that edited by George
Birkbeck Hill, revised and enlarged by L. F. Powell, in six volumes,
published by the Oxford University Press from 1934 to 1950. A few
changes in punctuation have been made to meet the exigencies of
abridgment.</p>
<p>The Powell-Hill <em>Johnson</em> is one of the monuments of scholarship,
probably <em>the</em> great edition of any English classic. The reader who
wishes to read the entire <em>Life of Johnson</em> is, of course, referred to
this edition. We are grateful to the Oxford University Press for their
gracious permission to use the Powell-Hill text in this abridgment.
[<em>The Life of Samuel Johnson</em> comprises vols. 1–4 of the Powell-Hill
edition; vols. 5–6 are Boswell’s <em>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</em>
and Johnson’s <em>Diary of a Journey into North Wales</em>.]</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Few men in history have ever been known as intimately as Samuel
Johnson. Famous in his own time for his wit and wisdom, he has had the
rare good fortune to gain a posthumous extension of personality and
influence over a period of more than one hundred and sixty years.
James Boswell’s boast that Johnson would “be seen in this work more
completely than any man who has ever yet lived” has been borne out in
the greatest biography in the English language. To give the modern
reader the spirit and substance of Johnson’s life and times, Bergen
Evans, Professor of English at Northwestern University, has winnowed
out the obscurities and irrelevances of the full text and kept its
essence. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML abridgment. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published 25 May 1952. <em>WR</em> 7 June 1952. First printing: Not
ascertained. Also published in MLCE. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in
MLCE.</p>
<p>The ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge
Boswell’s <em>Life of Samuel Johnson</em>. Pottle indicated that he was badly
behind schedule with Boswell’s <em>Journal</em> for McGraw-Hill and added, “I
have no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’s <em>Life of
Johnson</em>. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that
to abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will
buy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is
that the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is,
that they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of
Boswell’s <em>Life of Johnson</em> will continue to be for textbook use in
schools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the
best offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text <u>with a good
index</u>” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951;
underlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition of
<em>The Life of Samuel Johnson</em> (G2) which lacked an index.</p>
<p>Stein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was
Bergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’s <em>Tristam
Shandy</em> in MLCE (1950) and was the author of <em>The Natural History of
Nonsense</em> (1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis
Kronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein
memo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in
the project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on
Johnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography, <em>Samuel Johnson</em> (Henry Holt,
1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have
written and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29
June 1951).</p>
<p>Stein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words.
“There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and
there is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment
of Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein
to Evans, 10 July 1951).</p>
<p>Evans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’s <em>Life of Samuel
Johnson</em> (G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the
first 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal
number of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is
notoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the
errors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from
Malone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from
the definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized
its use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to
about half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The
permission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.</p>
<p>Evans told Stein in a long letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m <u>enthusiastic</u> about this project. I have cut the book down
to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious
significance and without having to make any changes whatever except,
perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for
commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that
no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read
this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to
tell you what had been omitted.</p>
<p>What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but
most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing
Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and
no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of
Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal
comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly
unknown to the common reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts,
then hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing
of her own &amp; has a good, philosophic mind &amp; a sense of style but no
particular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go
through the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to
cut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I
let the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson
canon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had
cut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its
interest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from
over 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text
again, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000,
I believe, nothing <u>whatever</u> of any value or significance . . .
was taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it
with a nail file &amp; took out parenthetical interjections that were
irrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either
the sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and
sections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves
uninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some
unimportant person.”</p>
<p>He concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything
like it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . <u>No</u> solid
thought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly
readable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it
might have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951;
underlining in original).”</p>
<p>Evans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Among the many suggestions sent to the editors for new additions to
the Modern Library, one that recurs most frequently is for the
inclusion of James Fenimore Cooper’s favorite among his
Leatherstocking Tales. In response to that demand and because of the
revival of interest in Cooper’s works, <em>The Pathfinder</em> becomes the
first of his romantic adventure novels to appear in the series. This
tale of Cooper’s gallant and resourceful wilderness scout mirrors
faithfully the world of Indian warfare and romance of the early
American frontier. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Lea &amp; Blanchard, 1840. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1952. <em>WR</em> 15
November 1952. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Cerf considered including one of Cooper’s novels in the ML in 1948 with
an introduction by Sterling Lanier of Harvard University. He solicited
advice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos
Baker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the
Hampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in
Wellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George
Stewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard
Cooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated that <em>The
Pathfinder</em> would be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper
(Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favored <em>The Pathfinder</em>.
The response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone
a decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must
admit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present
seems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but
I can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters
I have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948).</p>
<p>Three years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and
asked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf
what he thought of a Giant containing <em>The Deerslayer</em>, <em>The Pilot</em>, and
<em>Satanstoe</em>, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite
Cooper novel. In the end <em>The Pathfinder</em> was published in the regular
ML.</p>

the grand tradition of the German short story in the nineteenth
century. Two of the tales in this volume, Heinrich Mann’s

translations by Professor Lange, are presented for the first time in a

</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Great German Short Novels and
Stories</em>, ed. Bennett A. Cerf (256). Published December 1952. <em>WR</em> 10
January 1953. First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on
16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the
entire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.</p>
<p>Lange suggested a revision of the ML anthology <em>Great German Short
Novels and Stories</em> after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s
<em>Faust</em> which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930:
200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only
collection of German narrative prose in English translation that the
student is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely
unsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to
Stein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein
to Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of
contents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two
exceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for
economic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length
of the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s <em>Immensee</em> instead of
replacing it with the author’s <em>Carsten Curator</em> “because it has become
a ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange
that “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical
sketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the
stories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen
selections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s
original anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a
different translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of
$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid
the cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for
selections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death
in Venice” (see 256).</p>

For several years the editors of the Modern Library have sought to
include a representative yet variegated collection of Franz Kafka’s
short stories in the series. Now, after long negotiations, fifteen of
his best tales, selected and brilliantly introduced by Philip Rahv,
editor of <em>The Partisan Review</em>, are made available to the
ever-expanding circle of Kafka enthusiasts. The newly recognized
master of obsessive fantasy, of symbolic narrative, stark and
compelling in its reality, is represented in this volume by such
memorable stories as “The Metamorphosis,” “The Great Wall of China,”
“The Judgment,” “In the Penal Colony,” “The Hunter Gracchus,” “The
Burrow,” and nine others of equal power and inexorable fascination.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No writer in history has illuminated the dark and fantastic side of
the human soul with the clarity and perception of Kafka, and this
group of stories has been selected to reflect his finest and most
representative work.</p>
<p>In his brilliant introduction to this volume, Philip Rahv writes,
“Kafka so compellingly arouses in us a sense of immediate relatedness,
of strong even if uneasy identification . . . because of the profound
quality of his feeling for the experience of human loss, estrangement,
guilt and anxiety—an experience increasingly dominant in the modern
age.” Indeed, Kafka speaks to today’s world with a rarely equaled
immediacy and directness of expression.</p>
<p>These selected stories comprise fifteen of Kafka’s best-known and most
typical works, including “The Metamorphosis,” “In the Penal Colony,”
“The Great Wall of China,” “Investigations of a Dog,” and “The New
Advocate.” <em>Note:</em> Ellipsis in original.</p>

<p>Original ML collection selected from <em>The Penal</em> <em>Colony</em>, translated by
Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1946) and <em>The Great Wall of
China</em>, translated by Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1948). ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall
1952. <em>WR</em> 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.</p>
<p>The negotiations that resulted in publication of <em>Selected Stories of
Franz Kafka</em> took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’
hopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty
over the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to
plan a collection of thirteen stories selected from <em>The Penal</em> <em>Colony</em>
and <em>The Great Wall of China</em> in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken
Books appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against
royalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the
contract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested
resuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November
1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would
use other translations of the two most important stories and find other
material to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).</p>
<p>Commins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and
reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we
at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by
reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the
ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of
this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.</p>
<p>I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s
stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of
the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,
whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is
valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other
than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.</p>
<p>Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede
with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission
for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s
short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project
unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we
make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.</p>
<p>I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into
the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to
Cerf, 8 December 1949)</p>

<p>After analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins
reported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken
[<em>sic</em>] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.
There are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents
which are not protected. These would require new translation, but there
would not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are
convinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen
negotiations with Shocken [<em>sic</em>]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January
1950).</p>
<p>Kurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported
that Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation
which were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken
proposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make
a selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help
arrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).
Little had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months
later. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of
<em>The Great Wall of China</em> with additional stories, were still
forthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML
selection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken
to Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May
1951).</p>
<p>Cerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the
Kafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could
produce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,
16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952
Random House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus &amp; Young for the
publication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great
Wall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It
is not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &amp;
Young guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random
House’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,
Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point
Schocken capitulated.</p>
<p>The ML edition of <em>Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa</em>, reprinted by
arrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared
three months later.</p>
<p>The ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received
$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been
ascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of
5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two
printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two
printings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These
figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;
some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the
total of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate
within 20,000 copies or so.</p>

Jess Stein, who came to Random House after the\nwar to work on *The American College Dictionary* and stayed to work with\nreference books and college texts, was the first to alert Random House\nof the implications of this development. He alerted Lewis Miller in the\nfollowing memo:\n\n> I now have a little more information about the Doubleday paperbacks\n> which were the subject of the rumor I heard yesterday. This new series\n> apparently will appear in April with 12 titles and prices will range\n> from 65¢ to 95¢. The type of material in these books will be the kind\n> that usually appears in the Mentor series (Stein, Memorandum to\n> Miller, 18 September 1952).\n\nDoubleday and Charles Scribner’s Sons were two of the publishing houses\nthat withdrew reprint contracts for some of the best titles in the\nModern Library during 1952. The Scribner’s withdrawal was especially\ndifficult for the Modern Library, since the titles were the best-known\nworks of Ernest Hemingway. The firm had decided to promote its backlist\nmore vigorously. When plans were made to issue Hemingway’s works in a\nuniform edition, Scribner’s decided to terminate the Modern Library’s\nreprint contracts.\n\nCerf was dismayed at the news. Losing Hemingway from the Modern Library\nwas an unwelcome prospect. As Klopfer stated later, “The Modern Library\nhas enormous prestige as a series of literary books and there are very\nfew living American authors who deserve to be included in it, and\ncertainly Ernest Hemingway belongs there” (Klopfer to Darrow, 13 July\n1954).\n\n### Number of titles\n\nEight titles were added and six were discontinued, bringing titles in\nthe list to 290.\n\n### Format\n\nNew titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the\nstiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s\nendpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth\nwith inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue,\nred or green) on the spine and front cover. The top edge was stained to\nmatch the inset panels on the spine and front cover.\n\n### Price\n\n$1.25.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Dinesen, *Out of Africa* xCooper, *The Pathfinder*; Giants\nthrough G75 with G54 *Anthology of Famous British Stories*; jackets:\n360. (Fall) Cooper, *The Pathfinder* xGunther, *Death Be Not Proud*;\nGiants through G76 (=spring 1953); jackets: 362.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf tried unsuccessfully to secure reprint rights to two Scribner\ntitles. He wanted to publish a ML edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s\n*Tender is the Night* (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, 10 April 1952). He also\nwanted to include a book by John Galsworthy in the series but was not\ninterested in any of the titles that Scribner’s were willing to\nconsider.\n\n### New titles\n\nDonne, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (1952) 446\n\nDinesen, *Out of Africa* (1952) 447\n\n*Eighteenth Century Plays* (1952) 448\n\nSchulberg, *What Makes Sammy Run?* (1952) 449\n\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson*, abridged by Bergen Evans (1952) 450\n\nCooper, *The Pathfinder* (1952) 451\n\nLange, ed., *Great German Short Stories and Novels* (1952) 452\n\nKafka, *Selected Short Stories* (1952) 453### Discontinued\n\nFast, *The Unvanquished* (1945)\n\nHamsun, *Growth of the Soil* (1935)\n\nKuprin, *Yama* (1932)\n\nSantayana, *Philosophy* (1942)\n\nSwinburne, *Poems* (1917)\n\nVan Loon, *Ancient Man* (1922)\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 446\n\n**JOHN DONNE.

That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been\n> reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life\n> ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St.\n> Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons\n> which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily\n> wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by\n> Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry\n> and a generous selection of his prose. (*Spring 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s *Complete Poetry\nand Selected Prose*, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed\nfrom plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. *WR* 5\nApril 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from\nNonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein\nto Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The\nML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore\nmore economical to print.\n\n*The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne* was originally\nscheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition\nwas postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of\n$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an\nadditional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.\nStein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:\n\n> There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in\n> the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a\n> number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being\n> carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John\n> Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they\n> have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high\n> for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College\n> Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue\n> getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a\n> disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production\n> aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever\n> before.

(*Fall 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML abridgment. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting.\nPublished 25 May 1952. *WR* 7 June 1952. First printing: Not\nascertained. Also published in MLCE. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in\nMLCE.\n\nThe ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge\nBoswell’s *Life of Samuel Johnson*. Pottle indicated that he was badly\nbehind schedule with Boswell’s *Journal* for McGraw-Hill and added, “I\nhave no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’s *Life of\nJohnson*. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that\nto abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will\nbuy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is\nthat the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is,\nthat they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of\nBoswell’s *Life of Johnson* will continue to be for textbook use in\nschools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the\nbest offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text <u>with a good\nindex</u>” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951;\nunderlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition of\n*The Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2) which lacked an index.\n\nStein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was\nBergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’s *Tristam\nShandy* in MLCE (1950) and was the author of *The Natural History of\nNonsense* (1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis\nKronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein\nmemo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in\nthe project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on\nJohnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography, *Samuel Johnson* (Henry Holt,\n1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have\nwritten and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29\nJune 1951).\n\nStein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words.\n“There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and\nthere is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment\nof Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein\nto Evans, 10 July 1951).\n\nEvans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’s *Life of Samuel\nJohnson* (G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the\nfirst 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal\nnumber of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is\nnotoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the\nerrors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from\nMalone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from\nthe definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized\nits use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to\nabout half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The\npermission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.\n\nEvans told Stein in a long letter:\n\n> I’m <u>enthusiastic</u> about this project. I have cut the book down\n> to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious\n> significance and without having to make any changes whatever except,\n> perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for\n> commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that\n> no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read\n> this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to\n> tell you what had been omitted.\n>\n> What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but\n> most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing\n> Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and\n> no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of\n> Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal\n> comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly\n> unknown to the common reader.\n\nEvans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts,\nthen hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing\nof her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no\nparticular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go\nthrough the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to\ncut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I\nlet the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson\ncanon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had\ncut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its\ninterest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from\nover 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text\nagain, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000,\nI believe, nothing <u>whatever</u> of any value or significance . . .\nwas taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it\nwith a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were\nirrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either\nthe sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and\nsections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves\nuninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some\nunimportant person.”\n\nHe concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything\nlike it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . <u>No</u> solid\nthought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly\nreadable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it\nmight have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951;\nunderlining in original).”\n\nEvans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952.\nProofreading was done at Random House.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (Giant, 1931) G2\n\nJohnson, *Johnson’s Dictionary: A Modern Selection* (1965) 572\n\nJohnson, *Johnson Reader* (1966) 580\n\n***Fall***\n\n### 451\n\n**JAMES FENIMORE COOPER.

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf considered including one of Cooper’s novels in the ML in 1948 with\nan introduction by Sterling Lanier of Harvard University. He solicited\nadvice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos\nBaker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the\nHampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in\nWellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George\nStewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard\nCooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated that *The\nPathfinder* would be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper\n(Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favored *The Pathfinder*.\nThe response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone\na decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must\nadmit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present\nseems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but\nI can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters\nI have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948).\n\nThree years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and\nasked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf\nwhat he thought of a Giant containing *The Deerslayer*, *The Pilot*, and\n*Satanstoe*, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite\nCooper novel.

First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on\n16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the\nentire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.\n\nLange suggested a revision of the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s\n*Faust* which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930:\n200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only\ncollection of German narrative prose in English translation that the\nstudent is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely\nunsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to\nStein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein\nto Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of\ncontents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two\nexceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for\neconomic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length\nof the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s *Immensee* instead of\nreplacing it with the author’s *Carsten Curator* “because it has become\na ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange\nthat “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical\nsketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the\nstories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen\nselections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s\noriginal anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a\ndifferent translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of\n$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid\nthe cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for\nselections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death\nin Venice” (see 256).\n\n#### 452b.

ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall\n1952. *WR* 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.\n\nThe negotiations that resulted in publication of *Selected Stories of\nFranz Kafka* took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’\nhopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty\nover the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to\nplan a collection of thirteen stories selected from *The Penal* *Colony*\nand *The Great Wall of China* in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken\nBooks appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the\ncontract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested\nresuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November\n1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would\nuse other translations of the two most important stories and find other\nmaterial to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).\n\nCommins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and\nreported:\n\n> The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we\n> at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by\n> reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the\n> ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of\n> this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.\n>\n> I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s\n> stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of\n> the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,\n> whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is\n> valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other\n> than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.\n>\n> Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede\n> with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission\n> for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s\n> short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project\n> unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we\n> make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.\n>\n> I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into\n> the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to\n> Cerf, 8 December 1949)\n\nAfter analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins\nreported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken\n\\[*sic*\\] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.\nThere are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents\nwhich are not protected. These would require new translation, but there\nwould not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are\nconvinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen\nnegotiations with Shocken \\[*sic*\\]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January\n1950).\n\nKurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported\nthat Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation\nwhich were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken\nproposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make\na selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help\narrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).\nLittle had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months\nlater. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of\n*The Great Wall of China* with additional stories, were still\nforthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML\nselection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken\nto Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May\n1951).\n\nCerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the\nKafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could\nproduce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,\n16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952\nRandom House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the\npublication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great\nWall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It\nis not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &\nYoung guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random\nHouse’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point\nSchocken capitulated.\n\nThe ML edition of *Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa*, reprinted by\narrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared\nthree months later.\n\nThe ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received\n$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been\nascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of\n5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two\nprintings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two\nprintings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These\nfigures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;\nsome records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the\ntotal of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate\nwithin 20,000 copies or so.\n\n#### 453b.

Jess Stein, who came to Random House after the\nwar to work on *The American College Dictionary* and stayed to work with\nreference books and college texts, was the first to alert Random House\nof the implications of this development. He alerted Lewis Miller in the\nfollowing memo:\n\n> I now have a little more information about the Doubleday paperbacks\n> which were the subject of the rumor I heard yesterday. This new series\n> apparently will appear in April with 12 titles and prices will range\n> from 65¢ to 95¢. The type of material in these books will be the kind\n> that usually appears in the Mentor series (Stein, Memorandum to\n> Miller, 18 September 1952).\n\nDoubleday and Charles Scribner’s Sons were two of the publishing houses\nthat withdrew reprint contracts for some of the best titles in the\nModern Library during 1952. The Scribner’s withdrawal was especially\ndifficult for the Modern Library, since the titles were the best-known\nworks of Ernest Hemingway. The firm had decided to promote its backlist\nmore vigorously. When plans were made to issue Hemingway’s works in a\nuniform edition, Scribner’s decided to terminate the Modern Library’s\nreprint contracts.\n\nCerf was dismayed at the news. Losing Hemingway from the Modern Library\nwas an unwelcome prospect. As Klopfer stated later, “The Modern Library\nhas enormous prestige as a series of literary books and there are very\nfew living American authors who deserve to be included in it, and\ncertainly Ernest Hemingway belongs there” (Klopfer to Darrow, 13 July\n1954).",

First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from\nNonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein\nto Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The\nML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore\nmore economical to print.\n\n*The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne* was originally\nscheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition\nwas postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of\n$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an\nadditional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.\nStein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:\n\n> There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in\n> the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a\n> number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being\n> carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John\n> Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they\n> have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high\n> for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College\n> Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue\n> getting favorable printing arrangements.

Discontinued 1970/71; retained in\nMLCE.\n\nThe ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge\nBoswell’s *Life of Samuel Johnson*. Pottle indicated that he was badly\nbehind schedule with Boswell’s *Journal* for McGraw-Hill and added, “I\nhave no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’s *Life of\nJohnson*. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that\nto abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will\nbuy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is\nthat the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is,\nthat they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of\nBoswell’s *Life of Johnson* will continue to be for textbook use in\nschools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the\nbest offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text <u>with a good\nindex</u>” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951;\nunderlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition of\n*The Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2) which lacked an index.\n\nStein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was\nBergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’s *Tristam\nShandy* in MLCE (1950) and was the author of *The Natural History of\nNonsense* (1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis\nKronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein\nmemo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in\nthe project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on\nJohnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography, *Samuel Johnson* (Henry Holt,\n1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have\nwritten and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29\nJune 1951).\n\nStein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words.\n“There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and\nthere is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment\nof Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein\nto Evans, 10 July 1951).\n\nEvans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’s *Life of Samuel\nJohnson* (G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the\nfirst 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal\nnumber of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is\nnotoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the\nerrors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from\nMalone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from\nthe definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized\nits use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to\nabout half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The\npermission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.\n\nEvans told Stein in a long letter:\n\n> I’m <u>enthusiastic</u> about this project. I have cut the book down\n> to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious\n> significance and without having to make any changes whatever except,\n> perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for\n> commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that\n> no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read\n> this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to\n> tell you what had been omitted.\n>\n> What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but\n> most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing\n> Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and\n> no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of\n> Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal\n> comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly\n> unknown to the common reader.\n\nEvans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts,\nthen hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing\nof her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no\nparticular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go\nthrough the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to\ncut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I\nlet the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson\ncanon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had\ncut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its\ninterest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from\nover 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text\nagain, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000,\nI believe, nothing <u>whatever</u> of any value or significance . . .\nwas taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it\nwith a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were\nirrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either\nthe sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and\nsections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves\nuninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some\nunimportant person.”\n\nHe concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything\nlike it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . <u>No</u> solid\nthought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly\nreadable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it\nmight have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951;\nunderlining in original).”\n\nEvans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952.\nProofreading was done at Random House.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (Giant, 1931) G2\n\nJohnson, *Johnson’s Dictionary: A Modern Selection* (1965) 572\n\nJohnson, *Johnson Reader* (1966) 580\n\n***Fall***"

He solicited\nadvice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos\nBaker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the\nHampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in\nWellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George\nStewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard\nCooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated that *The\nPathfinder* would be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper\n(Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favored *The Pathfinder*.\nThe response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone\na decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must\nadmit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present\nseems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but\nI can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters\nI have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948).\n\nThree years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and\nasked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf\nwhat he thought of a Giant containing *The Deerslayer*, *The Pilot*, and\n*Satanstoe*, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite\nCooper novel.

First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on\n16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the\nentire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.\n\nLange suggested a revision of the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s\n*Faust* which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930:\n200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only\ncollection of German narrative prose in English translation that the\nstudent is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely\nunsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to\nStein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein\nto Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of\ncontents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two\nexceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for\neconomic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length\nof the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s *Immensee* instead of\nreplacing it with the author’s *Carsten Curator* “because it has become\na ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange\nthat “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical\nsketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the\nstories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen\nselections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s\noriginal anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a\ndifferent translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of\n$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid\nthe cost of permissions.

ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall\n1952. *WR* 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.\n\nThe negotiations that resulted in publication of *Selected Stories of\nFranz Kafka* took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’\nhopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty\nover the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to\nplan a collection of thirteen stories selected from *The Penal* *Colony*\nand *The Great Wall of China* in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken\nBooks appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the\ncontract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested\nresuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November\n1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would\nuse other translations of the two most important stories and find other\nmaterial to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).\n\nCommins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and\nreported:\n\n> The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we\n> at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by\n> reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the\n> ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of\n> this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.\n>\n> I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s\n> stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of\n> the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,\n> whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is\n> valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other\n> than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.\n>\n> Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede\n> with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission\n> for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s\n> short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project\n> unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we\n> make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.\n>\n> I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into\n> the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to\n> Cerf, 8 December 1949)\n\nAfter analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins\nreported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken\n\\[*sic*\\] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.\nThere are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents\nwhich are not protected. These would require new translation, but there\nwould not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are\nconvinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen\nnegotiations with Shocken \\[*sic*\\]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January\n1950).\n\nKurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported\nthat Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation\nwhich were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken\nproposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make\na selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help\narrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).\nLittle had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months\nlater. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of\n*The Great Wall of China* with additional stories, were still\nforthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML\nselection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken\nto Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May\n1951).\n\nCerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the\nKafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could\nproduce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,\n16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952\nRandom House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the\npublication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great\nWall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It\nis not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &\nYoung guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random\nHouse’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point\nSchocken capitulated.\n\nThe ML edition of *Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa*, reprinted by\narrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared\nthree months later.\n\nThe ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received\n$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been\nascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of\n5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two\nprintings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two\nprintings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These\nfigures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;\nsome records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the\ntotal of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate\nwithin 20,000 copies or so.\n\n#### 453b.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1952 1952 Two emerging trends shaped directions for the Modern Library in 1952:\ngrowth in the quality paperback market and initiatives by publishers to\ndiscontinue contracts with the Modern Library for reprint permissions.\n\nIntimations of the developments in paperback publishing reached Random\nHouse in September 1952. Jess Stein, who came to Random House after the\nwar to work on *The American College Dictionary* and stayed to work with\nreference books and college texts, was the first to alert Random House\nof the implications of this development. He alerted Lewis Miller in the\nfollowing memo:\n\n> I now have a little more information about the Doubleday paperbacks\n> which were the subject of the rumor I heard yesterday. This new series\n> apparently will appear in April with 12 titles and prices will range\n> from 65¢ to 95¢. The type of material in these books will be the kind\n> that usually appears in the Mentor series (Stein, Memorandum to\n> Miller, 18 September 1952).\n\nDoubleday and Charles Scribner’s Sons were two of the publishing houses\nthat withdrew reprint contracts for some of the best titles in the\nModern Library during 1952. The Scribner’s withdrawal was especially\ndifficult for the Modern Library, since the titles were the best-known\nworks of Ernest Hemingway. The firm had decided to promote its backlist\nmore vigorously. When plans were made to issue Hemingway’s works in a\nuniform edition, Scribner’s decided to terminate the Modern Library’s\nreprint contracts.\n\nCerf was dismayed at the news. Losing Hemingway from the Modern Library\nwas an unwelcome prospect. As Klopfer stated later, “The Modern Library\nhas enormous prestige as a series of literary books and there are very\nfew living American authors who deserve to be included in it, and\ncertainly Ernest Hemingway belongs there” (Klopfer to Darrow, 13 July\n1954). Eight titles were added and six were discontinued, bringing titles in\nthe list to 290. New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the\nstiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s\nendpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth\nwith inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue,\nred or green) on the spine and front cover. The top edge was stained to\nmatch the inset panels on the spine and front cover. $1.25. (Spring) Dinesen, *Out of Africa* xCooper, *The Pathfinder*; Giants\nthrough G75 with G54 *Anthology of Famous British Stories*; jackets:\n360. (Fall) Cooper, *The Pathfinder* xGunther, *Death Be Not Proud*;\nGiants through G76 (=spring 1953); jackets: 362. Cerf tried unsuccessfully to secure reprint rights to two Scribner\ntitles. He wanted to publish a ML edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s\n*Tender is the Night* (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, 10 April 1952). He also\nwanted to include a book by John Galsworthy in the series but was not\ninterested in any of the titles that Scribner’s were willing to\nconsider. Donne, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (1952) 446\n\nDinesen, *Out of Africa* (1952) 447\n\n*Eighteenth Century Plays* (1952) 448\n\nSchulberg, *What Makes Sammy Run?* (1952) 449\n\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson*, abridged by Bergen Evans (1952) 450\n\nCooper, *The Pathfinder* (1952) 451\n\nLange, ed., *Great German Short Stories and Novels* (1952) 452\n\nKafka, *Selected Short Stories* (1952) 453 Two emerging trends shaped directions for the Modern Library in 1952:\ngrowth in the quality paperback market and initiatives by publishers to\ndiscontinue contracts with the Modern Library for reprint permissions.
