<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1935</h1>
<h2>1935</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>A growing number of trade books were published under the Random House
imprint. Works by American authors included Clifford Odets, <em>Three
Plays</em>, Robinson Jeffers, <em>Solstice and Other Poems</em>, Gertrude Stein,
<em>Lectures in America</em>, and <em>The Pulitzer Prize Plays, 1918–1934</em>, edited
by Kathryn Coe and William H. Cordell. British and Irish authors were
represented by C. Day Lewis, <em>Collected Poems, 1929–1933</em> and <em>The
Complete Works of John M. Synge</em>. Nonfiction included Emile Burns, <em>A
Handbook of Marxism</em> and Oswald Jacoby and others, <em>The Four Aces System
of Contract Bridge.</em> Other books included Dostoyevsky, <em>The Idiot</em> with
illustrations by Boardman Robinson, which was reprinted in ML Giants in
1942.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Ten new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the
number of titles in the regular ML to 213. Six new titles were published
in the ML Giants, one of which (Symonds, <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>) was in
two volumes. By the end of 1935 the Giants included twenty-two titles in
twenty-four volumes.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles except John Reed, <em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em> (280)
were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜
in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).
<em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em> had a binding measuring 7⅛ x 4⅞ inches
(182 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ inches (179 x 120 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in fall 1939. The new binding
measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177
x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with
the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x
4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type; all but three had torchbearer A2. Dickens,
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> (284) had torchbearer C2; Mann, <em>Buddenbrooks</em>
(285) and Ferber, <em>Show Boat</em> (286) had torchbearer A3. All new titles
had the 3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:</p>
<p>BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER</p>
<p>T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y</p>
<p>NEW YORK</p>
<p>The imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line
format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing
firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and
Klopfer as partners.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped
in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold
above the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued
to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown with the top
edge stained the same color as the binding. Each title was published in
all four bindings.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>All new titles had Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53)
except Reed, <em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em>, which had plain endpapers
on cream paper. ML books that were slightly larger than the standard
format had white edges around the endpaper design, but <em>Ten Days That
Shook the World</em> was so much larger that the patterned endpaper was
abandoned altogether. The only other balloon cloth bindings that did not
use Kent’s endpaper were three spring 1939 titles which were published
in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning
that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in
spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were
unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials
were extended to fill the larger space.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>All new titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets
except <em>An Anthology of Light Verse</em> (278), which had an individually
designed non-pictorial jacket. The front flap of each jacket included
descriptive text about the work written by Saxe Commins.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Hamsun, <em>Growth of the Soil</em> xMann, <em>Buddenbrooks</em>; Giants
through G21; jackets: 236. (Fall) Mann, <em>Buddenbrooks</em> xGogol, <em>Dead
Souls</em>; Giants through G24; jackets: 239. <em>Note:</em> Titles scheduled for
January publication were printed late in the preceding year; ML lists
inside the jackets and at the end of first printings are typically those
of the preceding fall.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>The only information available in the RH archives for a suggested title
during 1935 is the <em>Complete Works of Chaucer</em>. This title was
considered for an ML Giant. Estimated at 1200 pages, the length of the
work was decided to be prohibitive. “The composition costs will be
enormous, running between ten and five thousand dollars” (Commins to
Knopf, 7 October 1935). This title was never added to the ML.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The merry quips and satirical shafts of the world’s foremost poets are
gathered together in a volume of light-hearted verse. Representative
of the poetry from the earliest days of English verse down to the last
rhymed witticisms of contemporary singers, this anthology is always on
the side of excellence and good taste. The spontaneous gaieties of
Shakespeare and Dorothy Parker, Pope and Ogden Nash, W. S. Gilbert,
Lewis Carroll, Calverley, Edna St. Vincent Millay and scores of others
are captured in a book that mocks at solemnity and banishes the sober
mood. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published January 1935. <em>WR</em> 26 January 1935.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p>Kronenberger outlined his plan for <em>An Anthology of Light Verse</em> in a
letter dated 5 December 1930; the book was published over four years
later. Cerf wrote Kronenberger in 1932 and 1933 asking when the
anthology would be ready. When Kronenberger indicated in November 1933
that he would deliver the manuscript the following week, Cerf replied:
“The Board of Directors of the Modern Library has passed a resolution
unanimously to the effect that the Anthology will be much more welcome
in this dignified sanctum than the compiler thereof. The book had better
be good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933). The anthology sold
5,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of
sales.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The elemental strength and simplicity of <em>Growth of the Soil</em> won for
its author the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921 and for itself a
permanent place among the great novels of our century. An epic of the
soil, it portrays the alliance between Man and Nature in a story
notable for its magnitude and compassion. The eternal struggle for the
physical means of life becomes a revelation of heroism and profound
spiritual meaning. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worster translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by
Alfred A. Knopf, 1921. ML edition (pp. [5]–304; [5]–276) printed
from Knopf plates. Published February 1935. <em>WR</em> 9 March 1935. First
printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1951.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.
The ML secured reprint rights in December 1934 after offers in 1932 and
1933 had been rejected. Cerf told Knopf that <em>Growth of the Soil</em> would
make a “tremendous title” for the ML; after signing the contract he
exclaimed, “One more deal like this and we’ll be on Federal Relief!”
(Cerf to Knopf, 3 December 1934; Cerf to Knopf, 19 December 1934). The
royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when
the ML increased the list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June
1947). <em>Growth of the Soil</em> sold 3,620 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
John Reed’s eye-witness account of the ten most decisive days of the
Russian Revolution has become an authentic historical document and a
vivid, moment-to-moment narrative of the Bolshevik rise to power.
Reed, American-born and graduate of Harvard, lies buried beneath the
Kremlin wall in Moscow, an almost legendary figure in the hierarchy of
national heroes and martyrs of the Revolution. His book is recognized
internationally as a faithful record of the events leading to the
dictatorship and the dominance of the Soviet system in Russia. It is
required reading for those who want to know how Communism first took
over the government of one-sixth of the world. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em> unrolled in November, 1917, when the
Bolsheviks, in a second revolution, seized power from the government
that had succeeded the Czar. John Reed wrote this eyewitness account
of the Bolshevik Revolution as reportage, as personal history, as
propaganda, but also as raw history. Published in 1919, and written
before the rise of an official Communist version of these events
(Trotsky here still stands beside Lenin, and Stalin is nowhere to be
found), it still retains its value as history; but more important than
this, it helped create an image, a myth, of the Bolshevik Revolution
which was enormously influential in America, in other countries where
the book was widely circulated, and in Communist Russia itself, where
it was translated by Lenin’s wife and introduced enthusiastically by
Lenin.</p>
<p>The present edition of <em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em> has a new
introduction by Bertram D. Wolfe, author of <em>Three Who Made a
Revolution</em>, which relates this important work to our current
knowledge of the Russian Revolution. (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Printed from newly set plates that were also used for a paperback
edition in Vintage Books. Vintage and ML editions published fall 1960.</p>
<p>The plates used for 280.1 had become badly worn when the ML decided to
bring out a new edition. Wolfe received $1,000 for his introduction.
Reed’s notes were shifted from the appendix to the end of each chapter.
Wolfe suggested the addition of an index.</p>

With the publication of her first novel, <em>The Time of Man</em>, Elizabeth
Madox Roberts attained the front rank among living American writers.
The glowing beauty of her work, its insight, its vividness and lyrical
flow give to this chronicle of the American soil a distinction shared
by few novels of our time. The story of Ellen Chesser is an American
idyl that captures the grim and exalted meaning of the pioneer’s
struggle with the land. It is a book that has earned its own and its
author’s eminence. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>

Robinson Jeffers’ position as the writer of the most challenging
poetry of our time is now generally conceded. The spiritual tragedies
that he sets against the rocky landscape of the Pacific coast reveal
all the fierce intensity and overwhelming beauty of his unique gifts.
When <em>Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems</em> was first published a new
and elemental force in our native poetry was acclaimed. Now, in the
Modern Library, it wins new adherents for the poet of the dark
labyrinths of the human soul. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>

<p>The original B&amp;L plates were too large for the ML’s format and new
plates had to be made for the ML edition. Cerf gave Jeffers an
opportunity to revise the text but he declined. In the introduction he
stated: “. . . it is a pleasure to write, but after a thing has been
written I hate to see it again; poems are the sort of children that it
is delightful to beget, dreary to educate. . . . So I made terms with my
conscience and my publisher: ‘If you’ll let me off revising I’ll write
an introduction instead; that will only take a few hours, the other
would take weeks’” (p. vii). <em>Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems</em> sold
2,403 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it in the bottom quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of

<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
For many years Robinson Jeffers has maintained a distinguished place
among the poets of America. When <em>Roan Stallion,</em> <em>Tamar and Other
Poems</em> was first published a new and elemental force in our native
poetry was acclaimed. The fierce tragedies enacted against a
background of the rocky landscape of the Pacific Ocean revealed the
brooding and tortured men and women whose hearts Jeffers searched. In
poem after poem over many years, he has explored the dark labyrinths
of the human spirit. Without compromise or concession he has pursued
his search and written about the stark beauty of a rugged landscape
and the agonized gropings of a people at war with their environment
and themselves. (<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>

The fame of W. Somerset Maugham rests securely on two novels. The
first, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (No. 176), has steadily maintained its
position as one of the two best sellers on the entire Modern Library
list during the last three years. The second, <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em>,
now takes its place in the series with the promise of competing for
popular favor with its celebrated predecessor. This story of Charles
Strickland, driven by the demon of his genius to the South Seas,
parallels in many respects the strange life of Paul Gauguin. (<em>Spring

<p>Freiman reported in 1944 that the plates, though not perfect, could be
used for several more years, but Haas decided to make new plates for
Maugham’s <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (199) and <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em> at the
same time. Freiman contacted Doubleday, Doran to determine whether it
was willing to supply new plates or at least pay part of the cost
(Freiman memo to Haas, 13 November 1944). Doubleday, Doran agreed to
reset and replate both titles at its own expense as long as the ML
agreed to keep them in print and promote them aggressively for at least
ten years (Cedric R. Crowell, Doubleday, Doran, to Commins, 2 January
1945). The new plates were delivered to the ML’s printers in December
1945. The ML instructed Parkway Printing Co. to dispose of the old
plates and use the new ones for all future printings (Regina Spirito to
Bill Simon, Parkway Printing, 13 December 1945). The first printing from
the new plates (not seen) was for 7,000 copies in April 1946.</p>

It is now almost a full century since <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> was
published, yet it still stands as one of the best of all the
historical novels written during that time. New generations of readers
have obtained their first understanding of the meaning of the French
Revolution as a social cataclysm and a human drama from the pages of
this novel. They have participated in its blood-stirring events not by
following the career of notable and spectacular personages, but by
identifying themselves with Sydney Carton, the Defarges and the other
obscure people who lived and died during the reign of terror. (<em>Fall

<p>Wagenknecht received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Wagenknecht, 24

bibliography, the number of leaves is identical to 284b. This was

the new introduction), the first part title (which was added at the head
of chapter 1 and mysteriously appears as well at the head of the title
page), and the ML lists at the end of the book. In addition, pp. 395–96
were adjusted with minor resetting to accommodate the last three lines

The winner of the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature, Thomas Mann, stands

years, <em>The Magic Mountain</em> (#200) has maintained its position as one

<p>The ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third
printings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The
reprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an
eighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200
advance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining
copies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of
Knopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies
(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing
under the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML
reported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the
bindery and that <em>Buddenbrooks</em> would be completely out of stock within
a few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty
statement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting
sales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance.</p>

Millions of people have enjoyed <em>Show Boat</em> in at least one of its
many manifestations. First as a book it was a national best seller. As
a play, a musical comedy, a weekly radio feature for three years, and,
in its latest version, an operatic film, <em>Show Boat</em>, like the river
it celebrates, rolls on forever. Now in the Modern Library series,
Edna Ferber’s famous chronicle of the Mississippi summons a new
audience to Captain Andy Hawks’ floating palace of entertainment.
Jerome Kern, the well-known composer, provides a foreword. (<em>Fall

<p>Daniel Longwell of Doubleday, Doran asked Cerf in 1934 if Ferber’s <em>Show
Boat</em> or <em>So Big</em> could be included in the ML “in however small an
edition” and indicated that no advance on royalties would be required.
“It would help us tremendously,” he observed, “to be able to tell Edna
Ferber right now that you are going to do that” (Longwell to Cerf, 4
April 1934). Cerf replied that nothing could be done during the coming
season. “Our Fall Modern Library list already includes THE GREAT GATSBY,
PORGY, and LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL, and that is more than enough Americana
for this one installment!” (Cerf to Longwell, 9 April 1934). <em>Show Boat</em>
appeared in the ML the following year and was discontinued five years
later. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
One need not be an expert to partake with A. Edward Newton in the most
fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every
ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince
among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded
his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of
<em>The Amenities of Book-Collecting</em> made it the unanimous choice of the
editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to
be welcomed into the series. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression
published by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>],
[<em>16</em>]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from
the sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a
black-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the
Atlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and
printed with the text. Published December 1935. <em>WR</em> 14 December 1935.
First printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to <em>The Amenities of
Book-Collecting</em> when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was
still selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to
Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24
August 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just
returned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we
had a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that
time I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library
edition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to
you and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about
it” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he
would be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25
February 1935).</p>
<p>The Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf
initially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he
wanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750
against royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay
only 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after
which the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to
McIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think
that Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure
that every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale
of at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the
book is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the
pages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).</p>
<p>Cerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the
$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset
“would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result
may not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough
to suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The
Polygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the
plates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work,
including all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints
(make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408
for 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).</p>
<p>Newton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf
invited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant
not only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but
special attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words,
the new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new
review of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to
Newton, 25 April 1935).</p>

Works by American authors included Clifford Odets, *Three\nPlays*, Robinson Jeffers, *Solstice and Other Poems*, Gertrude Stein,\n*Lectures in America*, and *The Pulitzer Prize Plays, 1918–1934*, edited\nby Kathryn Coe and William H. Cordell. British and Irish authors were\nrepresented by C. Day Lewis, *Collected Poems, 1929–1933* and *The\nComplete Works of John M. Synge*. Nonfiction included Emile Burns, *A\nHandbook of Marxism* and Oswald Jacoby and others, *The Four Aces System\nof Contract Bridge.* Other books included Dostoyevsky, *The Idiot* with\nillustrations by Boardman Robinson, which was reprinted in ML Giants in\n1942.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nTen new titles were added and nine were discontinued, bringing the\nnumber of titles in the regular ML to 213. Six new titles were published\nin the ML Giants, one of which (Symonds, *Renaissance in Italy*) was in\ntwo volumes. By the end of 1935 the Giants included twenty-two titles in\ntwenty-four volumes.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles except John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (280)\nwere published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜\nin. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).\n*Ten Days That Shook the World* had a binding measuring 7⅛ x 4⅞ inches\n(182 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ inches (179 x 120 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in fall 1939. The new binding\nmeasured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177\nx 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with\nthe binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x\n4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type; all but three had torchbearer A2. Dickens,\n*A Tale of Two Cities* (284) had torchbearer C2; Mann, *Buddenbrooks*\n(285) and Ferber, *Show Boat* (286) had torchbearer A3. All new titles\nhad the 3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners.\n\n### Binding\n\nBalloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued\nto be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown with the top\nedge stained the same color as the binding. Each title was published in\nall four bindings.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nAll new titles had Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53)\nexcept Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World*, which had plain endpapers\non cream paper. ML books that were slightly larger than the standard\nformat had white edges around the endpaper design, but *Ten Days That\nShook the World* was so much larger that the patterned endpaper was\nabandoned altogether. The only other balloon cloth bindings that did not\nuse Kent’s endpaper were three spring 1939 titles which were published\nin the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning\nthat fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in\nspring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were\nunchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials\nwere extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll new titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets\nexcept *An Anthology of Light Verse* (278), which had an individually\ndesigned non-pictorial jacket. The front flap of each jacket included\ndescriptive text about the work written by Saxe Commins.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Hamsun, *Growth of the Soil* xMann, *Buddenbrooks*; Giants\nthrough G21; jackets: 236. (Fall) Mann, *Buddenbrooks* xGogol, *Dead\nSouls*; Giants through G24; jackets: 239. *Note:* Titles scheduled for\nJanuary publication were printed late in the preceding year; ML lists\ninside the jackets and at the end of first printings are typically those\nof the preceding fall.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nThe only information available in the RH archives for a suggested title\nduring 1935 is the *Complete Works of Chaucer*. This title was\nconsidered for an ML Giant. Estimated at 1200 pages, the length of the\nwork was decided to be prohibitive. “The composition costs will be\nenormous, running between ten and five thousand dollars” (Commins to\nKnopf, 7 October 1935). This title was never added to the ML.\n\n### New titles\n\nKronenberger, ed., *Anthology of Light Verse* (1935) 278\n\nHamsun, *Growth of the Soil* (1935) 279\n\nReed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935) 280\n\nRoberts, *Time of Man* (1935) 281\n\nJeffers, *Roan Stallion, Tamar and Other Poems* (1935) 282\n\nMaugham, *Moon and Sixpence* (1935) 283\n\nDickens, *Tale of Two Cities* (1935) 284\n\nMann, *Buddenbrooks* (1935) 285\n\nFerber, *Show Boat* (1935) 286\n\nNewton, *Amenities of Book-Collecting* (1935) 287### Discontinued\n\nArtzibashev, *Sanine* (1931)\n\nChesterton, *Man Who Was Thursday* (1918)\n\nFlaubert, *Salammbô* (1929)\n\nIbsen, *Wild Duck, The League of Youth, Rosmersholm* (1918)\n\nKomroff, ed., *Oriental Romances* (1930)\n\nMaupassant, *Une Vie; Bel Ami* (1932)\n\nSchopenhauer, *Studies in Pessimism* (1917)\n\nVan Vechten, *Peter Whiffle* (1929)\n\nWells, *Ann Veronica* (1917)\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 278\n\n**LOUIS KRONENBERGER, ed<span class=\"smallcaps\">.</span> AN ANTHOLOGY OF\nLIGHT VERSE. 1935–1956.

When Kronenberger indicated in November 1933\nthat he would deliver the manuscript the following week, Cerf replied:\n“The Board of Directors of the Modern Library has passed a resolution\nunanimously to the effect that the Anthology will be much more welcome\nin this dignified sanctum than the compiler thereof. The book had better\nbe good!” (Cerf to Kronenberger, 22 November 1933). The anthology sold\n5,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of\nsales.\n\n#### 278b.

John Reed wrote this eyewitness account\n> of the Bolshevik Revolution as reportage, as personal history, as\n> propaganda, but also as raw history. Published in 1919, and written\n> before the rise of an official Communist version of these events\n> (Trotsky here still stands beside Lenin, and Stalin is nowhere to be\n> found), it still retains its value as history; but more important than\n> this, it helped create an image, a myth, of the Bolshevik Revolution\n> which was enormously influential in America, in other countries where\n> the book was widely circulated, and in Communist Russia itself, where\n> it was translated by Lenin’s wife and introduced enthusiastically by\n> Lenin.\n>\n> The present edition of *Ten Days That Shook the World* has a new\n> introduction by Bertram D. Wolfe, author of *Three Who Made a\n> Revolution*, which relates this important work to our current\n> knowledge of the Russian Revolution. (*Fall 1960*)\n\nPrinted from newly set plates that were also used for a paperback\nedition in Vintage Books.

Wolfe received $1,000 for his introduction.\nReed’s notes were shifted from the appendix to the end of each chapter.\nWolfe suggested the addition of an index.\n\n### 281\n\n**ELIZABETH MADOX ROBERTS.

(*Fall 1935*)\n\nLowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by\nAlfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\]–389; \\[1\\]–359) printed\nfrom Knopf plates. Published October 1935. *WR* 2 November 1935. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third\nprintings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The\nreprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an\neighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200\nadvance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining\ncopies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of\nKnopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies\n(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing\nunder the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML\nreported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the\nbindery and that *Buddenbrooks* would be completely out of stock within\na few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty\nstatement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting\nsales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance.\n\n### 286\n\n**EDNA FERBER.

Edward Newton in the most\n> fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every\n> ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince\n> among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded\n> his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of\n> *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* made it the unanimous choice of the\n> editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to\n> be welcomed into the series. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression\npublished by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\],\n\\[*16*\\]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from\nthe sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a\nblack-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the\nAtlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and\nprinted with the text. Published December 1935. *WR* 14 December 1935.\nFirst printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.\n\nCerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to *The Amenities of\nBook-Collecting* when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was\nstill selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to\nAlfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24\nAugust 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just\nreturned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we\nhad a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that\ntime I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library\nedition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to\nyou and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about\nit” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he\nwould be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25\nFebruary 1935).\n\nThe Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf\ninitially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he\nwanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay\nonly 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after\nwhich the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to\nMcIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think\nthat Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure\nthat every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale\nof at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the\nbook is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the\npages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).\n\nCerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the\n$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset\n“would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result\nmay not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough\nto suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The\nPolygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the\nplates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work,\nincluding all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints\n(make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408\nfor 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).\n\nNewton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf\ninvited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant\nnot only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but\nspecial attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words,\nthe new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new\nreview of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to\nNewton, 25 April 1935).",

(*Fall 1935*)\n\nLowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by\nAlfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\]–389; \\[1\\]–359) printed\nfrom Knopf plates. Published October 1935. *WR* 2 November 1935. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third\nprintings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The\nreprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an\neighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200\nadvance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining\ncopies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of\nKnopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies\n(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing\nunder the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML\nreported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the\nbindery and that *Buddenbrooks* would be completely out of stock within\na few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty\nstatement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting\nsales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance."

Edward Newton in the most\n> fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every\n> ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince\n> among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded\n> his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of\n> *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* made it the unanimous choice of the\n> editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to\n> be welcomed into the series. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression\npublished by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\],\n\\[*16*\\]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from\nthe sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a\nblack-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the\nAtlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and\nprinted with the text. Published December 1935. *WR* 14 December 1935.\nFirst printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.\n\nCerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to *The Amenities of\nBook-Collecting* when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was\nstill selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to\nAlfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24\nAugust 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just\nreturned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we\nhad a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that\ntime I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library\nedition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to\nyou and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about\nit” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he\nwould be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25\nFebruary 1935).\n\nThe Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf\ninitially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he\nwanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay\nonly 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after\nwhich the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to\nMcIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think\nthat Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure\nthat every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale\nof at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the\nbook is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the\npages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).\n\nCerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the\n$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset\n“would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result\nmay not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough\nto suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The\nPolygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the\nplates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work,\nincluding all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints\n(make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408\nfor 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).\n\nNewton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf\ninvited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant\nnot only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but\nspecial attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words,\nthe new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new\nreview of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to\nNewton, 25 April 1935)."
