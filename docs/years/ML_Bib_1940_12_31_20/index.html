Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s pretensions and his discomfiture, you will relish this rich portrait of a New England family with its background of rigid Puritanism. The tone throughout this novel is gentle, compassionate and ironic; its total purpose and achievement is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a passing but still warmly human American way of life.
