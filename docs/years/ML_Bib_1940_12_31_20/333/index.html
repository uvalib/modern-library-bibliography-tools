In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was pleased thatFlowering Judaswas to be included in the series. She wrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I hope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a buyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library a God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have more.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly, a kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book; authors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little on the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8 May 1940)."

Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400 copies ofFlowering Judasin stock, and Klopfer estimated that it would take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued in fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’sLight in August(429), which was published in the series shortly afterFlowering Judaswas discontinued."
