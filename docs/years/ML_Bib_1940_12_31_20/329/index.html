    "The appeal to conscience and the lyrical quality of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writing makeThe Island Withinhis most notable novel. In it he recounts the age-old plight of the man of integrity who must struggle alone against the evil forces of prejudice and reaction. With an unerring insight into the Jewish spirit, Mr. Lewisohn reveals the nobility of a people reflected by one of its sons in the modern world. The story he tells is rich in imagery and immensely rewarding to the reader who demands fiction with meaning and emotion. (Spring 1940)",
    "Originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1928. ML edition (pp. [1]–350) printed from Harper plates. Published April 1940.WR6 April 1940. First and only printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1942.",
    "The ML paid Harper’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. Lewisohn repeatedly urged Cerf to addThe Island Withinto the ML although two of his books,Up Stream(128) andThe Story of American Literature(G43), were already in the series. Cerf confided to Cass Canfield, Lewisohn’s publisher, “[T]hat seems more than enough to me.” He continued, “I did suggest to Lewisohn, however, that we might drop UP STREAM next year and substitute THE ISLAND WITHIN in its place. Lewisohn approved of this step with all the vociferousness at his command, which, I need scarcely tell you, is quelquechose [sic]” (Cerf to Canfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939).",
    "The Island Withinwas discontinued after two and a half years because of poor sales. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.",
