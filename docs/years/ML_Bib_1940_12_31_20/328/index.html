    "Nothing could be more timely than the publication at this moment of history of the two works which made Machiavelli both famous and infamous as a model for contemporary statesmen.The PrinceandThe Discourseshave become required reading for an understanding of our daily newspaper headlines.

    "Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML. When Machiavelli was included on the first list of titles to be included in MLCE, Stein offered Lerner $50 to add the bibliography and make any changes he wanted in the introduction (Stein to Lerner, 27 January 1950). Lerner made a number of small changes, including the addition of two sentences within the last paragraph, which begins with the sentence “Machiavelli sought to distinguish the realm of what ought to be and the realm of what is.”:",
    "To be realistic about methods in the politics of a democracy at home does not mean that you throw away all scruples, or accept the superior force of “reason of state,” or embrace the police-state crushing of constitutional liberties. To be realistic about the massing of power abroad in the economic and ideological struggle for the support of men and women throughout the world does not mean that you abandon the struggle for peace and for a constitutional imperium that can grow into a world republic."
