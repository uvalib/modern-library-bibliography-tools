Designed by Paul Galdone, June 1940; unsigned. Front flap: Writing ofHuman Being, Edna Ferber said: “It is a glorious book, a wise and deeply understanding book. It has a touch of God in it, and the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller,Kitty Foyle, as well as those who have yet to experience their first acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth ofHuman Being. (Fall 1940) Originally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights subsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp. [5–7], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a correction requested by Morley. Published October 1940.WR12 October 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946. The suggestion to includeHuman Beingin the ML came from Morley himself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939): Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little to see myself represented in there only byParnassus on Wheels; a worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look at it now. I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting inHuman Being, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person; a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us. Cerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be represented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I don’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be added; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley backlist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern Library” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted that he had never readHuman Beingand asked Morley to send him a copy (Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he still thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general interest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think that a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was able to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf to Morley, 30 August 1939). Morley’s novelKitty Foylewas a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuingHuman Beingin a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would prefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf agreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob [Haas] and I still think it is a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and the huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to Morley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition corrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9. Human Beingsold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that category.Parnassus on Wheels(213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was the second worst-selling title. There was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By February 1944 sales of the ML edition ofHuman Beingexceeded 6,000 copies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).
