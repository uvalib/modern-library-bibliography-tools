They have emphasized the religious and literary qualities of the Book of books, and have made it easy to read and understand. The historical background of each book is traced in simple and succinct commentaries, and the very arrangement of the books themselves, in the probable order of their writing, throws new light on the development of religious thought.The Short Bibleis a boon to those who seek its essential truth and beauty.

Cerf had offered a $5,000 advance forThe Complete Bible($3,000 on signing and $2,000 one year after publication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think we could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to Donald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the University of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint ofThe Complete Biblewas premature, Cerf offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy forThe Short Bible(Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939). Shortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean to run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became Acting Manager of the Press."

He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the complete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to the Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from California he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and Goodspeed had decided against a ML edition ofThe Short Bible. He reported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . . you and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up the Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until we can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant edition of theComplete Bible. I told him that we both understand full well that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but if we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to guarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of our contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December 1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939)."

He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell well, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML rejected it, and that whichever firm gotThe Short Biblewould have a “toe-hold” onThe Complete Bible. He recommended that the ML secureThe Short Bibleon the understanding that it would getThe Complete Bibleif and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and Klopfer’s concern that a ML edition ofThe Short Biblemight injure their chances of gettingThe Complete Bibleif it sold poorly but concluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23 February 1940)."

Hemens replied that it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be different the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to Cerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that many readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have the complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really impressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942).The Complete Biblenever appeared in the ML."
