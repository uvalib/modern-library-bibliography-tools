(Fall 1939) Jacket:Non-pictorial in dark reddish orange (38) and black on cream paper; title in reverse on curved dark reddish orange panel at right, other lettering in black. Designed by Joseph Blumenthal. Front flap: The addition of Chaucer’sTroilus and Cressidain a modern verse rendering to the Modern Library series is a boon to readers everywhere. For students in our schools and colleges especially it provides a scholarly and readable version of what is considered by the most eminent authorities to be, withTheCanterbury Tales(No. 161), Chaucer’s greatest achievement. Originally published under the Random House imprint in a volume which sold at $3.50, it is now issued in an entirely new edition at a price within the reach of everybody. (Spring 1940) Krapp translation originally published by Random House, 1932, with wood engravings by Eric Gill on the outer margins of facing pages (verso and recto) and full page wood engravings at the beginning of each of the five parts. Trade edition published from a new typesetting that closely follows that of the 1932 edition, with illustrations omitted and page numerals shifted from the head of the page at the outer margins to the foot of the page at the center. The trade edition is ⅜ inch larger than the ML edition and appears to have been published shortly before or simultaneously with the ML edition. ML edition (pp. v–309) printed from plates of the RH trade edition. The only significant differences between the two printings are the title leaf and half title: the RH half title is in Trafton script and the ML half title is in roman type. Published January 1940.WR27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1944. The ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful and was discontinued after less than five years. In 1957, thirteen years after the ML edition was discontinued, Random House used the ML plates to publishTroilus and Cressidain Modern Library Paperbacks, its trade paperback imprint. After Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960 the Knopf paperback series, Vintage Books, became Random House’s primary trade paperback imprint. Subsequent printings ofTroilus and Cressidaappeared in Vintage Books. Also in the Modern Library Chaucer,Canterbury Tales(1929–1971)  181"
