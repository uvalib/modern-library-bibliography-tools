Jacket:Pictorial in moderate yellow (87), vivid red (11), yellowish gray (93) and black on coated white paper depicting an Arab in front of a mosque, marching soldiers, a steamship at sea, and a Chinese peasant against moderate yellow background; title in vivid red on diagonal yellowish gray panel with ragged sides, other lettering in black. Signed: Galdone. Front flap: Vincent Sheean’s book is far more than its title implies; it is history in the making, a vivid interpretation of the ideas and struggles that have so suddenly changed our conception of the modern world. An eye-witness of violent events, the friend and confidant of men and women of power and influence, he has been able to give to this book an authority and intensity that few of the long succession of volumes fashioned on it have been able to attain.Personal Historyis a book of lasting importance. (Spring 1940) Originally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1935. ML edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML but remained the property of Doubleday, Doran. Published January 1940.WR27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1954. The original Doubleday, Doran plates were too large for the ML’s format. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition sold 6,635 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles during this eighteen-month period.Personal Historywas not among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952."
