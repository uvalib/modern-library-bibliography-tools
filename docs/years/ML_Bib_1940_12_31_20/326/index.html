    "The Pulitzer Prize Novel for 1938,The Late George Apley, is a delicious satire on the palmy days of Boston during America’s golden era. Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s discomfiture, you will relish the rich portrait of a New England family set against a background of Puritanism.

    "The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel for 1938,The Late George Apleyis a deft and devastating satire on the most proper of Bostonians when they were the self-appointed guardians of America’s social and intellectual destiny. Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s pretensions and his discomfiture, you will relish this rich portrait of a New England family with its background of rigid Puritanism. The tone throughout this novel is gentle, compassionate and ironic; its total purpose and achievement is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a passing but still warmly human American way of life. (Fall 1956)",
    "Originally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1937. ML edition (pp. [v]–354) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published January 1940.WR27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The initial reprint contract was for a period of three years and appears to have given the ML exclusive reprint rights. When the contract was renewed Little, Brown added a stipulation that gave them the option of authorizing a Pocket Books paperback edition (Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, to Cerf, 29 September 1943). The ML edition sold 6,118 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles during this eighteen-month period. Sales to September 1943 totaled 13,450 copies (Cerf to Elizabeth Marden, Little, Brown, 24 September 1943).",
