    "Readers ofThe GeneralandCaptain Horatio Hornblowerwill welcome the revival ofThe African Queenin the Modern Library series. In C. S. Forester’s happiest vein, this fabulous tale maintains from first page to last its breathless excitement. An asthmatic steam launch carries a timid Cockney and a maidenly English missionary on a river in Central Africa to the adventure of their lives. Romance triumphs over fate, tropical heat and whizzing bullets.The African Queenis a story to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime. (Fall 1940)",
    "Front flap reset with last sentence revised:",
    "“The African Queenis a story of high adventure and suspense, to be read at a sitting and to be relished for a lifetime.” (Fall 1959)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Little, Brown & Co., 1935, with the last four chapters of the British edition omitted. ML edition (pp. [1]–275) printed from Little, Brown plates with the last four chapters restored. Chapters 16–19 (pp. 276–[308]) printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1940.WR14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000 copies.",
    "Cerf had never readThe African Queen. He asked Little, Brown for a copy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about an hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that it was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years before the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.",
    "Forester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters omitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the foreword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in writing another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the end of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end without calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was called for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and it was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I really appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked of its last two [sic] chapters. . . . So it is with very great pleasure that I welcome this reissue ofThe African Queenfor the opportunity it gives me of presenting the book in the form in which I first pictured it” (p. [8])."
