<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1944</h1>
<h2>1944</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Three new ML titles published in spring 1944—Bergson, <em>Creative
Evolution</em> (368), Kaufman and Hart, <em>Six Plays</em> (369), and Melville,
<em>Moby Dick</em> (G65)—along with a number of backlist titles that were
reprinted that spring, include the following statement on the verso of
the title page:</p>
<p><em>Published by A. S. Barnes &amp; Co., Inc.</em></p>
<p><em>Distributed by Random House, Inc.</em></p>
<p>Paper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in
demand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable
to satisfy the demand for books.</p>
<p>The War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry
in fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota
based on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to
90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions
became increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional
10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year.</p>
<p>Most publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a
few—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In
fall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the
textbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated
Modern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board
requirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series
while RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles,
including those noted above, were also published under this arrangement.
The ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several
other publishers that had surplus paper.</p>
<p>The War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in
March 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers
were able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from
college text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for
the duration [of the war]. We counted on doing the same this year.
When the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire
production schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis
Browne, 4 April 1944).</p>
<p>All subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by
Random House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML
stopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued
to appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to
go out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The
profit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants
were paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML
books, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length.</p>
<p>A. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the
Illustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was
limited. Random House continued to select titles for the series,
commission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate
making, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were
reprinted.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Nine titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now
contained 239 titles.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>The 1943 format was unchanged for the 1944 publications. All new titles
in the regular ML were published in the standard format with the binding
measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x
118 mm). Bindings were red, blue, green or gray. Rockwell Kent’s
endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾
x 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of
books and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The Day family has become a part of our national tradition, and life
without Father Day would be very nearly unthinkable. With him, it has
been a joy, and sometimes even a trial, but always an enriching and
heartwarming adventure. <em>Life with Father</em>, as a play, has broken
records for continuous performances, and has established itself as a
modern American classic. In book form, Clarence Day’s family album is
aglow with the spirit of what all of us like best to remember of our
own past. (<em>Spring 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1935. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>],
v–258) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for February
1944; published 17 March 1944. <em>WR</em> 25 November 1944. First printing:
7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf a $6,000 advance of which $2,254 remained unearned in
spring 1954. Sharp received $75 for the jacket. Freiman wrote him: “Our
one regret is that we cannot afford to pay you a fee closer to the true
value of your work” (R. A. Freiman to Sharp, 18 November 1943).</p>
<p>Lindsay and Crouse, the authors of the Foreword, had written the play
based on Day’s book. In November 1943 the play was beginning its fifth
year on Broadway; it eventually ran over seven years to become the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_longest-running_Broadway_shows">longest-running non-musical play on
Broadway</a>.</p>
<p>Competing with the ML edition was a reprint edition published in 1943 by
Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press.</p>

As philosopher and man, Henri Bergson is one of the most esteemed
intellectual figures of the twentieth century. His major work,
<em>Creative Evolution</em>, embodies his chief contribution to the study of
reality as life and change. Influential among philosophers and popular
among general readers because of its persuasive argument and vivid
illustrations, this book has achieved permanence in the literature of
philosophical speculation. It takes an honored place in the Modern
Library series as a work of enduring vitality and ever–renewing
meaning to succeeding generations of thoughtful readers. (<em>Spring

<p>The ML paid Holt a $750 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.
When Cerf first approached Holt he noted, “I have never read Bergson’s
CREATIVE EVOLUTION. I am taking Irwin Edman’s word on this one” (Cerf to
William Sloan, Holt, 15 March 1943). He offered an advance of $1,000 on
the assumption that the ML would be able to print from Holt plates, but
Sloan discovered that the plates had been melted as part of the war
effort. Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with
the plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that
composition and plates would cost at least $500 and suggested reducing
the advance from $1,000 to $750, to which Cerf agreed. Edman received
$250 for the Foreword (Commins to Edman, 2 December 1943).</p>

In the more than eighty years since its first publication, Palgrave’s
<em>Golden Treasury</em> has maintained itself as a classic in its field. The
constant demand for this collection of songs and lyrics and the
insistent requests for <em>The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám</em> have led the
editors of the Modern Library to add the Fitzgerald masterpiece to the
Palgrave anthology. The poet and compiler were contemporaries, and the
works by which they will always be known appeared within two years of
each other. This long-cherished volume is introduced by one of the
foremost anthologists of our time, Louis Untermeyer. (Spring <em>1944</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Anthology of American Negro
Literature</em>, ed. V. F. Calverton (183). Publication announced for spring
1944. <em>WR</em> 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1957.</p>
<p>Watkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s <em>Anthology of
American Negro Literature</em> (1929) included short stories, selections
from novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and
autobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories,
essays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection
represents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s
Negro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the
Negro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind
about his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp.
xi–xii).</p>
<p>For poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have
been published in this field: <em>Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro
Poetry for Young Readers</em>, by Arna Bontemps; <em>Book of American Negro
Poetry</em>, by James Weldon Johnson; <em>Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse
by Negro Poets</em>, by Countee Cullen; <em>Negro Voices, An Anthology of
Contemporary Verse</em>, by Beatrice M. Murphy; <em>Negro Poets and Their
Poems</em>, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from
novels he recommends “that the following novels be read: <em>Their Eyes
Were Watching God</em>, by Zora N. Hurston; <em>Home to Harlem</em>, by Claude
McKay; <em>The Blacker the Berry</em>, by Wallace Thurman; <em>My Lives and How I
Lost Them</em>, by Countee Cullen; <em>These Low Gro</em>unds, by W. E. Turpin;
<em>Blood on the Forge</em>, by William Attaway; <em>Black Thunder</em>, by Arna
Bontemps; <em>Native Son</em>, by Richard Wright, and <em>The White Face</em>, by Carl
R. Offord” (p. xiii).</p>
<p>Keneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to <em>The Negro
Caravan</em>, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee
(Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that <em>The Negro Caravan</em> has been
highly influential in establishing a canon of African-American
literature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that
endures. He does not believe the same is true for the <em>Anthology of
American Negro Literature</em> (1944). (Kinnamon, 1997)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Deep in the heart of every human being, no matter how rational or
sceptical, there lurks a fascination for the weird and occult.
Disbelief does not lay ghosts, nor do the tests of science exorcise
them. Stairs creak in the dark with the tread of unseen visitors;
cemeteries send up midnight apparitions; and headless horsemen ride in
the moonlight.</p>
<p>In this completely revised edition of <em>Famous Ghost Stories</em>, Bennett
Cerf has included such classics of the supernatural as “The Beckoning
Fair One,” “The Willows,” “The Supper at Elsinore,” and “The Phantom
Rickshaw.” (<em>Fall 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Front flap reset with the following phrase added to the last sentence:</p>
<p>“and many other tales of terror and ghostly phenomena.” (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket B1:</em> Fujita non-pictorial jacket in deep yellow (85), strong
purplish red (255) and black on coated white paper; “Famous” in deep
yellow, “Ghost” in reverse, “Stories” in strong purplish red, and other
lettering in reverse.</p>
<p>Front and back flaps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps no literary genre has as valid a claim to time-proven
distinction as the ghost story; from the ages when men huddled around
a fire and exchanged tales to hold back the night, to this day when
science is beginning to probe the reaches of man’s mind, the ghost
story has held a place of honorable speculation. Whether we scoff or
believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling
fascination.</p>
<p>Bennett Cerf introduces this selection of notable ghost stories that
reflect the best of the form. Included are such shiveringly famous
tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return
of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard
Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home,
Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that
confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human
imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Best Ghost Stories</em> (67), which had
been in the ML since 1919. Publication announced for spring 1944. <em>WR</em> 5
August 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Cerf commented in <em>SRL</em>: “Ever since I have had anything to do with the
Modern Library, it has included one anthology which struck me as several
degrees below par, and that is its collection of ghost stories. This
summer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume.
The first step in this process, duly recognized by the International
Order of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb
through all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of
numerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library
archives” (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, 28 August 1943, p. 17).</p>
<p>Eleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the
anthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a
flat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4
cents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>Famous Ghost Stories</em> (IML 17) was also published in the Illustrated
Modern Library (1946) with illustrations by Hugo Steiner-Prag and
William Sharp.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
No book published in America during the last decade has been so
influential in interpreting to the Western mind the complexities and
aspirations of present-day China as Edgar Snow’s <em>Red Star Over
China</em>. Written with the authority of seventeen years of first-hand
observation of the revolutionary events in the great centers and
remote provinces, it has become required reading for everyone who
seeks to understand the role of China in the world today. The author
has revised this edition and provided a new introduction and epilogue
to bring it up to the present. (<em>Fall 1944</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1938. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting with a new preface and epilogue.
Publication announced for fall 1944. <em>WR</em> 3 February 1945. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1953.</p>
<p>The Random House edition was out of print when Snow inquired about a ML
reprint (Snow to Cerf, 10 November 1943). The original plates were too
large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to
date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly
legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November
1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive
rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the
original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense
here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the
addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii).</p>
<p>The original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies. There were six
printings of the ML edition with total sales of just over 27,000 copies
(Commins to Harold R. Isaacs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 4
September 1956).</p>

It is almost twenty years since the first of Dorothy Parker’s light
verse, sharpened to arrow-point and dipped in the bubbling acid of her
wit, brought her the kind of fame that belongs to the most frequently
quoted poet of the country. In that time not one of her countless
imitators has so much as disputed her position as the foremost ironist
in America. Here, for the legions of her old and new admirers, are all
the poems which appeared originally in <em>Enough Rope</em>, <em>Sunset Gun</em>,
<em>Death and Taxes</em>, plus numerous additional verses of equal
brilliance. (<em>Fall 1944</em>)</p>

<p>The title page, part titles, and endpapers of the Viking Press edition
contained decorations by Valenti Angelo printed in moderate reddish

<p>The Modern Library paid royalties of 10 cents a copy for Parker’s
<em>Collected Stories</em> (1942) and probably paid the same for <em>Collected
Poetry</em> (1942). By 1971 the royalty rate for <em>Collected Poetry</em> had
risen to 30 cents—still 10 percent of the list price.</p>

<p>Dorothy Parker’s verse, sharpened to arrow point and dipped in the

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1944\n\n## 1944\n\n### General\n\nThree new ML titles published in spring 1944—Bergson, *Creative\nEvolution* (368), Kaufman and Hart, *Six Plays* (369), and Melville,\n*Moby Dick* (G65)—along with a number of backlist titles that were\nreprinted that spring, include the following statement on the verso of\nthe title page:\n\n*Published by A. S. Barnes & Co., Inc.*\n\n*Distributed by Random House, Inc.*\n\nPaper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in\ndemand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable\nto satisfy the demand for books.\n\nThe War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry\nin fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota\nbased on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to\n90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions\nbecame increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional\n10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year.\n\nMost publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a\nfew—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In\nfall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the\ntextbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated\nModern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board\nrequirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series\nwhile RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles,\nincluding those noted above, were also published under this arrangement.\nThe ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several\nother publishers that had surplus paper.\n\nThe War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in\nMarch 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers\nwere able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from\ncollege text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for\nthe duration \\[of the war\\]. We counted on doing the same this year.\nWhen the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire\nproduction schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis\nBrowne, 4 April 1944).\n\nAll subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by\nRandom House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML\nstopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued\nto appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to\ngo out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The\nprofit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants\nwere paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML\nbooks, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length.\n\nA. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the\nIllustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was\nlimited. Random House continued to select titles for the series,\ncommission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate\nmaking, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were\nreprinted.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nNine titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now\ncontained 239 titles.\n\n### Format\n\nThe 1943 format was unchanged for the 1944 publications. All new titles\nin the regular ML were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x\n118 mm). Bindings were red, blue, green or gray. Rockwell Kent’s\nendpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾\nx 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of\nbooks and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Jefferson, *Life and Selected Writings* xParker, *Collected\nPoetry*; Giants through G65 (=fall 1944); jackets: 299.

Publication announced for spring\n1944. *WR* 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1957.\n\nWatkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1929) included short stories, selections\nfrom novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and\nautobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories,\nessays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection\nrepresents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s\nNegro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the\nNegro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind\nabout his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp.\nxi–xii).\n\nFor poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have\nbeen published in this field: *Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro\nPoetry for Young Readers*, by Arna Bontemps; *Book of American Negro\nPoetry*, by James Weldon Johnson; *Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse\nby Negro Poets*, by Countee Cullen; *Negro Voices, An Anthology of\nContemporary Verse*, by Beatrice M. Murphy; *Negro Poets and Their\nPoems*, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from\nnovels he recommends “that the following novels be read: *Their Eyes\nWere Watching God*, by Zora N. Hurston; *Home to Harlem*, by Claude\nMcKay; *The Blacker the Berry*, by Wallace Thurman; *My Lives and How I\nLost Them*, by Countee Cullen; *These Low Gro*unds, by W. E. Turpin;\n*Blood on the Forge*, by William Attaway; *Black Thunder*, by Arna\nBontemps; *Native Son*, by Richard Wright, and *The White Face*, by Carl\nR. Offord” (p. xiii).\n\nKeneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to *The Negro\nCaravan*, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee\n(Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that *The Negro Caravan* has been\nhighly influential in establishing a canon of African-American\nliterature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that\nendures. He does not believe the same is true for the *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1944).

This\nsummer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume.\nThe first step in this process, duly recognized by the International\nOrder of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb\nthrough all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of\nnumerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library\narchives” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 28 August 1943, p. 17).\n\nEleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the\nanthology was published.

The original plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to\ndate. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly\nlegitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November\n1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive\nrewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the\noriginal text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense\nhere and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the\naddition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii).\n\nThe original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies.

Barnes & Co., Inc.*\n\n*Distributed by Random House, Inc.*\n\nPaper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in\ndemand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable\nto satisfy the demand for books.\n\nThe War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry\nin fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota\nbased on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to\n90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions\nbecame increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional\n10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year.\n\nMost publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a\nfew—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In\nfall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the\ntextbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated\nModern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board\nrequirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series\nwhile RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles,\nincluding those noted above, were also published under this arrangement.\nThe ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several\nother publishers that had surplus paper.\n\nThe War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in\nMarch 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers\nwere able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from\ncollege text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for\nthe duration \\[of the war\\]. We counted on doing the same this year.\nWhen the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire\nproduction schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis\nBrowne, 4 April 1944).\n\nAll subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by\nRandom House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML\nstopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued\nto appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to\ngo out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The\nprofit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants\nwere paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML\nbooks, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length.\n\nA. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the\nIllustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was\nlimited. Random House continued to select titles for the series,\ncommission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate\nmaking, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were\nreprinted.",

Publication announced for spring\n1944. *WR* 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1957.\n\nWatkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1929) included short stories, selections\nfrom novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and\nautobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories,\nessays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection\nrepresents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s\nNegro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the\nNegro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind\nabout his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp.\nxi–xii).\n\nFor poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have\nbeen published in this field: *Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro\nPoetry for Young Readers*, by Arna Bontemps; *Book of American Negro\nPoetry*, by James Weldon Johnson; *Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse\nby Negro Poets*, by Countee Cullen; *Negro Voices, An Anthology of\nContemporary Verse*, by Beatrice M. Murphy; *Negro Poets and Their\nPoems*, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from\nnovels he recommends “that the following novels be read: *Their Eyes\nWere Watching God*, by Zora N. Hurston; *Home to Harlem*, by Claude\nMcKay; *The Blacker the Berry*, by Wallace Thurman; *My Lives and How I\nLost Them*, by Countee Cullen; *These Low Gro*unds, by W. E. Turpin;\n*Blood on the Forge*, by William Attaway; *Black Thunder*, by Arna\nBontemps; *Native Son*, by Richard Wright, and *The White Face*, by Carl\nR. Offord” (p. xiii).\n\nKeneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to *The Negro\nCaravan*, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee\n(Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that *The Negro Caravan* has been\nhighly influential in establishing a canon of African-American\nliterature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that\nendures. He does not believe the same is true for the *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1944).

The original plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to\ndate. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly\nlegitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November\n1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive\nrewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the\noriginal text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense\nhere and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the\naddition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii).\n\nThe original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1944 1944 Three new ML titles published in spring 1944—Bergson, *Creative\nEvolution* (368), Kaufman and Hart, *Six Plays* (369), and Melville,\n*Moby Dick* (G65)—along with a number of backlist titles that were\nreprinted that spring, include the following statement on the verso of\nthe title page:\n\n*Published by A. S. Barnes & Co., Inc.*\n\n*Distributed by Random House, Inc.*\n\nPaper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in\ndemand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable\nto satisfy the demand for books.\n\nThe War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry\nin fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota\nbased on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to\n90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions\nbecame increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional\n10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year.\n\nMost publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a\nfew—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In\nfall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the\ntextbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated\nModern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board\nrequirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series\nwhile RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles,\nincluding those noted above, were also published under this arrangement.\nThe ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several\nother publishers that had surplus paper.\n\nThe War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in\nMarch 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers\nwere able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from\ncollege text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for\nthe duration \\[of the war\\]. We counted on doing the same this year.\nWhen the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire\nproduction schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis\nBrowne, 4 April 1944).\n\nAll subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by\nRandom House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML\nstopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued\nto appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to\ngo out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The\nprofit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants\nwere paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML\nbooks, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length.\n\nA. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the\nIllustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was\nlimited. Random House continued to select titles for the series,\ncommission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate\nmaking, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were\nreprinted. Nine titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now\ncontained 239 titles. The 1943 format was unchanged for the 1944 publications. All new titles\nin the regular ML were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x\n118 mm). Bindings were red, blue, green or gray. Rockwell Kent’s\nendpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾\nx 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of\nbooks and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers. 95 cents Day, *Life with Father* (1944) 367\n\nBergson, *Creative Evolution* (1944) 368\n\nKaufman and Hart, *Six Plays* (1944) 369\n\nPalgrave, ed., *Golden Treasury* (1944) 370\n\nJefferson, *Life and Selected Writings* (1944) 371\n\nWatkins, ed., *Anthology of American Negro Literature* (1944) 372\n\nCerf, ed., *Famous Ghost Stories* (1944) 373\n\nSnow, *Red Star over China* (1944) 374\n\nParker, *Collected Poetry* (1944) 375 Three new ML titles published in spring 1944—Bergson, *Creative\nEvolution* (368), Kaufman and Hart, *Six Plays* (369), and Melville,\n*Moby Dick* (G65)—along with a number of backlist titles that were\nreprinted that spring, include the following statement on the verso of\nthe title page: [object Object]"
