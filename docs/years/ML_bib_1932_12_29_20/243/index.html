    "The world owes to the unchallenged master of the short story, Guy de Maupassant, an immense and increasing debt for having provided a transcript of life as dynamic as it is real and as true as it is fascinating. The forty tales in this volume represent him in the fullness of his powers, when his vision, style and artistry were at their apex. These stories were chosen and translated by Michael Monahan, whose introduction is a bold commentary and an acute analysis of Maupassant’s work. (Fall 1935)",
    "Original ML collection combining two ML volumes originally published by Boni & Liveright:Love and Other Stories(72) andMademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories(8). Pp.

First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1945 byThe Best Stories of Guy de Maupassant, ed. Saxe Commins (383).",
    "Despite the statement on the title page Monahan does not appear to be the translator of all the stories in the collection. He was credited as the translator ofLove and Other Stories(1919); the ML edition ofMademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories(1917) did not identify the translator. One story appears twice in the combined volume in different translations. “A Piece of String” (pp. 213–22) was added toLove and Other Storiesby 1930. It was also included (in a different translation) as “The Piece of String” (pp. 23–31) inMademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories.",
