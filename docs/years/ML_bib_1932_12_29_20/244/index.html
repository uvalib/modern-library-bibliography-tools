Jacket:Pictorial in grayish purplish blue (204) and black on cream paper with inset decorative map of Arabian peninsula, Persia and northwest India; borders in grayish purplish blue, lettering in black. Signed: Witold Gordon. Jacket title: THE ARABIAN NIGHTS | AN ADULT SELECTION. (Fall 1932) Front flap: The perpetual enchantment and all the magical and multi-colored pageantry ofThe Arabian Nightsare offered here in Sir Richard Burton’s rendering for the delectation of adult minds. Shahrazad spins her tales without censorial interruption, and the spell that possessed King Shahryar and since then has possessed mankind is not broken, praise be to Allah, by discreet asterisks and decorous euphemisms. The tales in this volume were chosen because they are the most fascinating and representative ofThe Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night. (Fall 1937) Original ML selection. Published September 1932.WR15 October 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. The title page ofThe Arabian Nights’ Entertainmentshad so much text that there was no room for the torchbearer or for Cerf and Klopfer’s names in the imprint. Cerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on the title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not strictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation of “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and unabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the stories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional phrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I believe it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged” (Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML made three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to Walter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the book for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in September 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition in November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap borrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition, paying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937). The Arabian Nightssold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling ML titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. 244b.
