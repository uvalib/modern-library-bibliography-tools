    "Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations. Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second only to the furore created by his ownTrilby. Then as a play, it has been, since 1915, a perennial favorite. As an opera, with a score by Deems Taylor, it found a prominent place in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and, finally as a cinema, it has reached countless thousands of people. In its original form, it remains a book of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (Spring 1937)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1891. New bibliographical edition published by Harper & Brothers with a 1919 copyright date; the new edition was probably published in the 1920s. ML edition (pp. [ii], v–vii, [1]–416) printed from plates of the later Harper edition. Published December 1932.WR31 December 1932. First printing: 7,450 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.",
    "The royalties that the ML paid to Harper & Brothers were based on sales, in contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number of copies printed.Peter Ibbetsonwas one of the few books in the ML printed on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary because of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first printing may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing of 8,000 copies and received 7,450.",
    "When the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s that it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations and asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the wood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the plates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s balloon-cloth format.",
    "Peter Ibbetsonsold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
