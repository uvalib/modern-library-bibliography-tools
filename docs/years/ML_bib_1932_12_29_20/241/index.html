Front flap: Alive with light-tipped quips and stinging darts,The Plays of Oscar Wilderepresent in fullest measure the famous decadent’s unique contribution to English letters. Master of the scintillant epigram and electric repartee, he is nowhere so happy and felicitous as in his dramatic writings. In time his prose may grow faint in memory and his poetry may be given a somewhat less lustrous appraisal, but he will always be remembered as the creator of these inimitably urbane, ironic and effervescent comedies.

Designed by Sara Eisenman. Front flap: “I have nothing to declare except my genius,” Oscar Wilde once told an American customs official. That genius is nowhere more apparent than in his plays, whose witty dialogue and paradoxical situations still have the power to charm, both on the stage and between covers. This volume contains one of his most perennially popular,The Importance of Being Earnest, whose satiric comments on English society and the clergy have never been surpassed;Salomé, considered shocking in its day, on which Richard Strauss’ opera is based; and three plays,Lady Windemere’s[sic]Fan,a Woman of No ImportanceandAn Ideal Husband, which give full play to Wilde’s scorn for hypocrisy. Printed from offset plates photographically reproduced from an earlier ML printing. Published spring 1980 at $5.95. ISBN 0-394-60490-3.
