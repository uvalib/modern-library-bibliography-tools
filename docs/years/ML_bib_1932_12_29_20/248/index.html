    "The years that have passed since the World War have been severe to the literature of that disastrous episode in human history. Only a few books have survived. Of these,Three Soldiersstands pre-eminent. It reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile.Three Soldiersintroduced a writer who has since become a major figure among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests securely. (Spring 1935)",
    "Originally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled for November 1932.WR17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1963.",
    "Eight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday, Doran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern Library, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and Three Soldiers.” He asked how many copiesThree Soldiershad sold in the trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial Library (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that the plates forThree Soldierswere too large for the ML’s format he contacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’sManhattan TransferandThe 42nd Parallel.Manhattan Transferhad sold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 forThe 42nd Parallel(Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those titles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin withThree Soldiersand addedThe 42nd Parallel(307) to the ML five years later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos Passos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.",
    "ForThree Soldiersthe ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his corrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know if I made more corrections in theThree Soldierstext than you can handle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were just going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was away when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked Cerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling corrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were. The introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was doing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf, undated).",
    "Three Soldierssold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from Doubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500 copies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20 August 1946).Three Soldiersdid not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
    "Houghton Mifflin withdrewThree Soldiersand Dos Passos’sU.S.A.(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality paperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination agreement in June and instructed the production department to make no more printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June 1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock and asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to bring outThree Soldiersuntil the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick Moseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated that the ML had 3,000 copies ofThree Soldiers, enough to last about a year, and a six- to eight-month supply ofU.S.A.(Klopfer to Moseley, 22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire ifThree Soldierswas out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was (Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January 1964).Three Soldierswas published in Sentry Editions later that year.",
    "Three Soldierswas dropped from separately published ML catalogs after fall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the end of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned toThe Buddhist Tradition, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring 1969 after the oversight was discovered.",
