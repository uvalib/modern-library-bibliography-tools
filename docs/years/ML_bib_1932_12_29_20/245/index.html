    "Yama the Pitis as sinister and pitiless as the vice it exposes and condemns. It omits nothing and condones nothing of the abominations of the oldest profession in the world. The stark picture of a brothel and the prostitute’s way of life becomes by the artistry of Alexandre Kuprin an indictment more scathing and effective than all the moral indignation of vice crusaders and the periodical revelations of the police.Yamacarries horror to a point beyond horror and into the realm of great realistic literature.

    "Guerney translation originally published (“privately printed”) for subscribers only, 1922. New edition published by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, 1929, with additions, revisions, and corrections by the author, a foreword by Arthur Garfield Hays, and an author’s postscript. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting based on the 1929 edition.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1952.",
    "Guerney’s introduction to the 1929 edition was revised for the ML.",
    "The ML paid Guerney a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. The contract specified that royalties were to drop to 9½ cents after the first 20,000 copies. Cerf originally offered Guerney royalties of 9½ cents on all copies but increased the offer following negotiations with Guerney. The $800 cost of making new plates was split between Guerney and the ML. Guerney’s half was to be charged against royalties after sales passed 20,000 copies, and the plates were to remain the property of the ML (Cerf to Guerney, 17 February 1931).",
