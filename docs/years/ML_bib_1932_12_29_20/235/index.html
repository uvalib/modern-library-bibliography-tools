    "Generation after generation of Americans has been brought up on the poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. To him can be attributed a major share of what love for poetry great masses of our people cherish. Such poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great lyricists of our national literature. (Spring 1938)",
    "Original ML collection. Published April 1932.WR7 May 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.",
    "Longfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his time. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when Longfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes substantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at Harvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death he received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice what he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained sufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin Co., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher, Ticknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced its edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott at Houghton Mifflin:",
    "A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we first noticed your announcement . . . [Longfellow is the] Poet of Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”",
    "Linscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for which the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy acknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).",
    "The ML initially intended to base its edition onThe Poems of Henry W. Longfellow, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library series. Linscott wrote again four days later:",
    "You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow” which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19 January 1932).",
    "Linscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete Cambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.",
    "At this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant figure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537), intervened. He wrote Cerf:",
    "I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it [the Longfellow matter]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.",
    "Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France,et cetera, or can you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February 1932)",
    "Both Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of Longfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to Linscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932). Linscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may have gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the circumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at present” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).",
    "In the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the copyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include nearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.",
    "When the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who acknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best wishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML edition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a new typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that had entered the public domain since 1932.",
    "The Poems of LongfellowandThe Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and Franklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket forThe Poems of Longfellowremained in use until the early 1940s.",
    "Cerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s, but it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s.The Poems of Longfellowsold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed services. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on to its first-quarter ranking.",
