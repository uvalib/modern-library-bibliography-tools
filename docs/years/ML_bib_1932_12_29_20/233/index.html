(Spring 1932) Jacket:Pictorial in deep purple (224) and black on gray paper depicting a barefoot man kneeling by a body of water and drinking; borders in deep purple, lettering in black. Signed: [Jacob] Burck. (Spring 1932) Originally published by Jonathan Cape & Harrison Smith, 1931. ML edition (pp. 1–380) printed from Cape & Smith plates. Published March 1932.WR26 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Published in Vintage Books, spring 1967. Cerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the ML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your Modern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to take with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE FURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the time the book was published, in your list [Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,was published by Cape & Smith in 1929]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will be a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us up.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few volumes. He requested Joyce’sPortrait of the Artist as a Young Manand any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books in which a Dostoyefsky [sic] influence was found. I have never read Dostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf, 15 April 1931). Cerf and Klopfer wanted to includeThe Sound and the FuryorAs I Lay Dying, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type which had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s audience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the cost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in production and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House between 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for books without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was cheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the possibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year or so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be instructed to melt the type (Harter,The Making ofWilliam Faulkner’s Books, 1929–1939, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult for reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive reprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial publication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from the original publisher’s plates. Faulkner’s next book,Sanctuary, had more commercial appeal. It was the only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were made. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback. The American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet Books—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight printings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies (Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on front cover). In his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he initially wroteSanctuaryfor money. The introduction begins: This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea, because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been writing books for about five years, which got published but not bought. . . . Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi) After sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job working the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between 12 and 4, I wroteAs I Lay Dyingin six weeks, without changing a word. I sent it to Smith [his publisher] and wrote him that by it I would stand or fall.” He continues: I think I had forgotten aboutSanctuary, just as you might forget about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.As I Lay Dyingwas published and I didn’t remember the mss. ofSanctuaryuntil Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting it, trying to make out of it something which would not shameThe Sound and the FuryandAs I Lay Dyingtoo much and I made a fair job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii) Faulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than the rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be reset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees Book Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the introduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like Burck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when E. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger format. Faulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith & Haas.Sanctuaryremained his only title in the ML until 1946, whenThe Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying(394) were published together in a single volume. Sanctuarysold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Faulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the series. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dyingwas the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML, followed byLight in August(429),Absalom, Absalom!(434), andSanctuary(233), which sold 4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML. 233.1b.

Front flap: This celebrated book, the sixth of William Faulkner’s novels in order of publication, first appeared on February 9, 1931, but a draft of the manuscript had been finished nearly two years earlier. When Mr. Faulkner saw the galley proofs of that version ofSanctuary, he felt “that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it.” He chose the latter course and did a thorough revision of the book, cutting some sections entirely and adding new ones, rewriting other sections in whole or in part, and rearranging the order of the narration. He thus succeeded in making it a book which “would not shame . . . too much,” as he put it,The Sound and the FuryandAs I LayDying, which had been published in the two preceding years.  (Inside of jacket blank; back flap lists Faulkner titles published in the ML throughfall1964.) The letterpress plate for the 233.1c title page appears to have been used for 233.1d with the line for Faulkner’s introduction and the rule at the foot of the page removed and torchbearer H substituted for torchbearer D3. The memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions fromSanctuaryandAbsalom, Absalom!was dated 14 November 1962 (Box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’sLight in Augustwas also dropped around this time. The earliest printing ofSanctuarywithout the introduction was in 1963 or 1964. Introductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was forLight in Augustin spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, includingSanctuary, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—Selected Short Stories,Intruder in the Dust,A Fable, andPylon—were new to the series.The Sound and the FuryandAs I Lay Dying, had previously been combined in a single ML volume. 233.2.New bibliographical edition(1965) SANCTUARY | [swelled rule] | WILLIAM | FAULKNER | [torchbearer J] | [swelled rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK Pp.

ML edition (233.2, pp. [3]–309) printed from RH plates with fly title in roman instead of italic. The bibliographical note on p. [311] reads as follows: SANCTUARY, the sixth of William Faulkner’s novels in order of publication, first appeared on February 9, 1931, but a draft of the manuscript had been finished nearly two years earlier. The first Modern Library edition ofSanctuaryappeared in the following year (1932), printed from the original plates, as all subsequent editions have been. These plates, because of the conditions surrounding their production, had a larger than usual number of typographical errors, most of them immediately recognizable as such. Some were discovered and corrected from time to time, but many remained. A great effort has been made in this new edition, which was entirely reset, to produce, with the co-operation of the author, the definitive text.
