The earliest jacket with the spelling corrected has not been ascertained. Jacket B:Uniform typographic jacket D with spelling of Dostoyevsky corrected. Front flap: In the whole literature of the subtle and mysterious relationship between man and the crimes he commits,Crime and Punishmentstands supreme for its insight, its compassion and its psychological fidelity. The story of the murder committed by Raskolnikov, his punishment and atonement, is the most gripping and illuminating study ever written of a crime of repugnance and despair, and the consequences which arise inevitably from it. In Dostoyevsky’s mind, crime is its own punishment and retributive justice can never be as severe as the penalty the human soul can impose on itself.

The plates were first used in 1944 for the Illustrated Modern Library edition (IML 10) and subsequently for regular ML printings. Regular ML printings added part titles for Parts 1–6 and the Epilogue at the head of each part (Illustrated ML printings had separate leaves for part titles) and substituted new chapter numbers and large initial capitals at the beginning of each chapter for those used in Illustrated ML printings. Part titles, chapter numbers, and large initial capitals in Illustrated Modern Library printings were designed to be printed in gray and black; those in regular ML printings were printed in black only. 228.2b.

Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. The ML invited Harry Levin and then Lionel Trilling to write the introduction. Both declined on the grounds that the $200 fee offered was inadequate (Erskine to Levin, 26 January 1950; Stein to Trilling, 3 February 1950; Trilling to Stein, 5 February 1950). At that point Stein telephoned Simmons, who had just accepted an invitation to write an introduction toThe Brothers Karamazovfor $200, and he agreed to doCrime and Punishmentinstead.228.3a.
