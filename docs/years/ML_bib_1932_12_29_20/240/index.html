    "Selected for their variety and range, the eight plays in this volume represent the complete pattern of an age. Separately and in their entirety they exemplify the spirit of the Elizabethan period, the richest in our literature, by their virility, daring and exuberant outspokenness. A compilation which includes Marlowe, Dekker, Heywood, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Massinger and Ford must be a treasury to be cherished by every modern reader. It is a book that has won for itself a distinguished place on the Modern Library shelf. (Fall 1934)",
    "Original ML anthology. Published August 1932.WR10 September 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969.",
    "The plays in the anthology were selected by Cerf. He asked George C. D. Odell of Columbia University what he thought of the selection and invited him to write the introduction (Cerf to Odell, 9 April 1931). Odell approved the plays but declined to write the introduction because he was on sabbatical in Paris. That fall Cerf invited a succession of scholars to write the introduction—Hardin Craig of Stanford University, Felix E. Schelling of the University of Pennsylvania, J. F. A. Pyre of the University of Wisconsin, and John Livingston Lowes of Harvard University. As one after another declined, Cerf doubled the fee from fifty to one hundred dollars. Esther Cloudman Dunn of Smith College accepted the assignment in February 1932 and received the $100 fee.",
