    "How to make available to the contemporary reader all the beauty of thought, language and imagery ofThe Divine Comedyhas been the primary consideration of the editors of the Modern Library in issuing this translated version of Dante’s masterpiece, complete and unabridged. After careful consideration of all the extant English translations and after consultation with the foremost university authorities, the Carlyle-Wicksteed rendering was chosen. It gives the entire scope, substance and spirit ofThe Divine Comedyto those numberless readers who cannot cope with the original. (Fall 1935)",
    "Jacket B:Pictorial in vivid red (11) and strong brown (55) on coated cream paper depicting Dante with an open book standing on a hillside overlooking the walls of a city, viewed through a border of stone portals; background within borders in vivid red with title and statement of responsibility for translation in reverse, other lettering in strong brown. Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1937; unsigned. Front flap as jacket A. (Fall 1937)",
    "Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by J. M. Dent & Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1932.WR31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and subsequently in Vintage Books.",
    "The ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of reports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from Henry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the translation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice Firuski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the translation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by T. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on Dante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent of Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski, 28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an introduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to Grandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.",
    "Cerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few paragraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932). Grandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using and knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the best translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher (Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an inferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the Temple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph by the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of the English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle, Thomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is clear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be readily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its scholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p. xiii).",
    "The Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’sDivine Comedythe best translations have been followed:Inferno, by John Aiken Carlyle;Purgatorio, by Thomas Okey;Paradisio, by Philip H. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim) follow, in the main, the excellent notes for theInfernoand thePurgatorioby Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr. Oeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for theParadisio” (251.1, p. 3; 251.2, p. xvii).",
    "ML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to the translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the translator ofPurgatorio. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations were not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML printings until 1963/64 (251.2c).",
    "Shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S. Singleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation ofThe Divine Comedyfor the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working on a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled to be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the approval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after theirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances totaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took longer than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years later it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The Bollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and 1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary. By that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become moribund and had ceased adding new titles.",
    "The Divine Comedysold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant titles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.",
