    "An historical and spiritual revelation,Poweris at once an unerring psychological and throbbing physical evocation of a human being and of the whole pageant of mankind. All the hope and frustration, the idealism and iniquity, the sensualism and ascetism [sic] of an epoch come into a magical synthesis on Feuchtwanger’s enormous canvas. Süss, the Jew, becomes more than the central character of an historical novel laid in eighteenth-century Württemberg; he is the core and the symbol of a race whose intellectual and idealistic mission is timeless and unending. (Spring 1934)",
