Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is usually done” (p. xix). The selections fromThe German IdeologyandCritique of Political Economyin Part II were added by the ML."

      "#text": "Cerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932). Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a Russian magazine calledEducation. To this very orthodox statement by Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p. xix)."

Eastman signed a contract to translate and edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested, Declined” under 1933 for more information."

Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack of an indextoCapital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings: “I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to Schuster, 8 February 1933)."
