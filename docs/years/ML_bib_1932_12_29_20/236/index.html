HisAutobiography, as rich in material as it is engaging in style, is one of those rare documents that reveals both a rich personality and the crucial events that transpired during his lifetime.

Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and Longfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from this day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press unless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both the typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think that the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to William Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932)."
