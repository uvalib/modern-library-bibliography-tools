    "The devotees of the novels of Joseph Conrad divide their enthusiasm equally betweenVictoryandLord Jim(No. 186 in the Modern Library). Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the World War,Victoryhas steadily grown in prestige through almost a quarter of a century. New readers come upon it as a rare discovery and old readers return to it for the sheer enjoyment of its prose style and subtle characterization.Victoryrepresents Joseph Conrad at the apex of his story-telling powers. (Fall 1936)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1915. ML edition printed from plates made from a new Doubleday, Doran typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published June 1932.WR2 July 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "Cerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights toVictory. In 1928 he offered an advance of $3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a royalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do appreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is unwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21 December 1928).Victorywas included in the Sun Dial Library published by Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title included in the series.Victorywas the seventh of eleven Sun Dial Library titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.",
    "Victorysold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.Lord Jim(210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales ofVictorytotaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad was one of the ML’s best-selling authors.Victorysold 7,966 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the twelfth best-selling title in the regular ML.Lord Jimwas the eighth best-selling title.",

    "Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War,Victorywas immediately acclaimed the work of a master. It has grown steadily in the estimation of a new generation of readers who have come upon it as a rare discovery. Older readers go back to it for the sheer pleasure of its graceful prose and its subtleties of characterization.Victoryis one of the novels by which Joseph Conrad achieved the fullest measure of his gifts as story-teller. It vies for favor withLord Jim(No. 186),Nostromo(No. 275) andHeart of Darkness(inGreat Modern Short Stories, No. 168). (Spring 1955)",
