Signed: RIKI. Front flap: To bring within the compass of a Modern Library volume the essence of Aristotle’s thought is an achievement of which the editors are pardonably proud. A book for students and general readers alike, this volume provides in its almost 700 pages the Posterior Analytics (Logic), De Anima (On the Soul), Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics, complete and unabridged, as well as generous selections from Physics, Metaphysics, and Politics. The interpretive introductions by Richard McKeon are helpful guides through the ever-new world of Aristotle’s ideas. (Spring 1947) Jacket A2:As jacket A1 with the designer’s name omitted. (Fall 1961)Note:There are two versions of the jacket, one with the designer’s name RIKI on the deep orange yellow panel, the other without the designer’s name. The earliest noted without the designer’s name dates from 1957. Some later printings of the jacket include the designer’s name, others omit it. Original ML collection drawn fromThe Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. Richard McKeon (Random House, 1941). All of the translations were originally published by Oxford University Press. Publication announced for January 1947.WR12 April 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. McKeon edited theBasic Works of Aristotlewithout a contract and was unhappy with the financial arrangements he was offered when it was completed. He had undertaken the collection hoping that it could be published as a ML Giant and was prepared to accept a flat fee of $500 if it was published in an inexpensive format suitable for classroom use. “I made it abundantly clear, in conversation,” he wrote later, “that in the event that a larger price was to be charged for the volume, I would consent to do it only on the basis of a continuing royalty payment” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). He was informed after he submitted the manuscript that it could not be published as a Giant, and Cerf rejected the royalty rate he suggested (5 percent on the first 3,500 copies rising to 12½ percent on sales over 10,000 copies). McKeon eventually agreed to an arrangement that limited his earnings to $1,250 (McKeon to Commins, ibid.). When Cerf invited him to compile a shorter collection of Aristotle’s writings for the ML, McKeon insisted on a contract before beginning work. He wrote Cerf, “If you had asked me to do the small Aristotle before the months of battling with Saxe [Commins] about the larger Aristotle, I should probably have told you it couldn’t be done. After that experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me, therefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the only thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would seem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more concretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you propose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold annual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945). The terms of the contract have not been ascertained, but McKeon described the royalty he received on sales ofIntroduction to Aristotleas “meager” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). Introduction to Aristotleestablished itself as a textbook and became one of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period from November 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,114 copies, making it the ML’s third best-selling title and one of eight titles (including Giants) with annual sales exceeding 10,000 copies. When the ML edition was declared out of print McKeon sought a reversion of rights so thatIntroduction to Aristotlecould be published by the University of Chicago Press. Random House agreed to his request, overlooking the fact that the collection was still in print in the paperbound series Modern Library College Editions. Klopfer admitted, “Nobody thought of the Modern Library College Edition until we had committed ourselves. . . . There wouldn’t have been a chance of reverting any rights to you if we hadn’t overlooked the MLCE” (Klopfer to Morris Philipson, University of Chicago Press, 2 October 1972). The reversion was limited to hardcover rights. The University of Chicago Press published its edition ofIntroduction to Aristotlein 1973. Described as a “second edition, revised and enlarged,” it included a new general introduction and new introductions to each work. In addition to the contents of the ML edition, it includedDe Partibus Animalium(On the Parts of Animals), Book I, Chapter 1, andRhetorica(Rhetoric), Book I, Chapters 1–4 and Book II, Chapters 18–22. The format was 3/16 inch taller than the 7½ inch format the ML was then using. The volume was perfect bound rather than sewn, and it was bound in thin paper-covered boards—technically a hardcover under the terms of the contract, but for practical purposes as close as possible to a paperback.
