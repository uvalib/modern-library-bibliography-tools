    "The play, based on Erskine Caldwell’s novel,Tobacco Road, was the most phenomenally successful production in the history of the American theatre. The novel itself has been one of the most widely read and discussed books of our time. Whatever controversies it has aroused, there has been no difference of opinion about its power and excitement. As the chronicler of the folkways of the impoverished South, Erskine Caldwell has re-created a world and a people with courageous realism. He has given us, inTobacco Road, a novel of extraordinary appeal and merit. (Spring 1947)",
    "Front flap revised:",
    "Tobacco Roadis one of the most widely read and discussed books of our time. Brilliantly realistic in its picture of moral and physical decay among the impoverished sharecroppers and tenant farmers of the South, this novel has been universally acclaimed for its high literary merit and for its socially significant viewpoint. Throughout the book there runs a skillfully drawn thread of rich humor, imparting to the reader a sympathetic understanding of the shocking state in which many Americans still live.",
    "Erskine Caldwell has long been regarded as one of our foremost writers, and most readers would giveTobacco Roada prominent place in the list of his writings. (Spring 1957)",
    "Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1932; rights subsequently transferred to Duell, Sloan and Pearce.

    "The reprint agreement for the ML edition was signed in May 1945 with publication scheduled for spring 1947 (Cerf to Charles Duell, 20 September 1946). The contract for the ML edition of Howard Fast’sThe Unvanquished(379), which appeared in fall 1945, was signed at the same time.

    "The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted that the retail price of ML books had increased since 1947 and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12 cents a copy.",

    "At the time of its publication in 1932,Tobacco Roadaroused excitement and indignation with its grim picture of poverty, ignorance and moral degeneracy in a Southern poor white family. One of the first of the realistic novels of the Depression, it was among the most controversial. Profoundly influential in its time—both artistically and socially—Tobacco Roadremains a landmark of American literature.",
