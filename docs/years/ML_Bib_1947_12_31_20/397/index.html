    "The play, based on Erskine Caldwell’s novel,Tobacco Road, was the most phenomenally successful production in the history of the American theatre. The novel itself has been one of the most widely read and discussed books of our time. Whatever controversies it has aroused, there has been no difference of opinion about its power and excitement. As the chronicler of the folkways of the impoverished South, Erskine Caldwell has re-created a world and a people with courageous realism. He has given us, inTobacco Road, a novel of extraordinary appeal and merit. (Spring 1947)",
    "Front flap revised:",
    "Tobacco Roadis one of the most widely read and discussed books of our time. Brilliantly realistic in its picture of moral and physical decay among the impoverished sharecroppers and tenant farmers of the South, this novel has been universally acclaimed for its high literary merit and for its socially significant viewpoint. Throughout the book there runs a skillfully drawn thread of rich humor, imparting to the reader a sympathetic understanding of the shocking state in which many Americans still live.",
    "Erskine Caldwell has long been regarded as one of our foremost writers, and most readers would giveTobacco Roada prominent place in the list of his writings. (Spring 1957)",

One of the first of the realistic novels of the Depression, it was among the most controversial. Profoundly influential in its time—both artistically and socially—Tobacco Roadremains a landmark of American literature.",
