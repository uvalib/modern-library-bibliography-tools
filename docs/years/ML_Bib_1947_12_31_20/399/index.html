Jacket:Non-pictorial in black and vivid red (11) on coated white paper; title in reverse on upper black panel; author, series and torchbearer in reverse on vivid red panel at foot. Front flap: A revival of interest in the novels of Anthony Trollope is spreading all over the world. Readers of the Modern Library series have clamored for the inclusion of their favorites from the pen of England’s great story-teller, and the most insistent demand has been forThe Eustace Diamonds. Accordingly, this 727-page novel about the beautiful but unconscionable Lady Lizzie Eustace and the greed that led her to theft and disaster finds a permanent place in distinguished company on the Modern Library shelf. (Spring 1947) ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1947.WR8 February 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1960. Cerf noted in his column inSaturday Review of Literaturethat a letter from Marion Dodd about aTrollope Readerthat she and Esther Cloudman Dunn were editing “was so persuasive that we forthwith decided to add Trollope’s ‘The Eustace Diamonds’ to the Modern Library series” (“Trade Winds,”SRL, 13 April 1946, p. 32). Bradford A. Booth, a professor of English at UCLA and editor ofThe Trollopian, offered to write an introduction to the ML edition gratis, but Cerf declined on the grounds that the length of the work prohibited publishing it with an introduction (Cerf to Booth, 29 April 1946).
