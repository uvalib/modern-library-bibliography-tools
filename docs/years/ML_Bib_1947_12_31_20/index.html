After that experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me, therefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the only thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would seem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more concretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you propose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold annual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945).
