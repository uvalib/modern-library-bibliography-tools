Signed: Riki. Front flap: It is a source of great pride to the editors of the Modern Library whenever a book universally recognized as a classic is added to the series. Such a volume, hailed for almost twenty-five centuries as a “universal history” by “the most Homeric of historians,” is Herodotus’ account of the struggle between Greece and Persia. Offered complete and unabridged in over 700 pages in the famous George Rawlinson translation, the work of the “Father of History” is available for the first time at a price within the means of every reader. Francis R. B. Godolphin, Dean of the College, Princeton University, provides an illuminating introduction. (Fall 1947) Rawlinson translation originally published in London, 1858–60. Published by Random House as part ofThe Greek Historians: The Complete and Unabridged Historical Works of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Arian, edited with an introduction, revisions, and additional notes by Francis R. B. Godolphin (2 vols., 1942). The ML text was taken fromThe Greek Historiansbut was printed from plates made from a new typesetting because of the ML’s smaller format. Goldolphin’s introduction to the ML edition consists of the first thirteen pages of his introduction toThe Greek Historians; the glossary and index to Herodotus in the larger work are omitted. Published fall 1947.WR10 January 1948. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Godolphin notes, “In the translation of Herodotus a number of passages omitted by Rawlinson have been restored to the text, and the artificiality of diction in the speeches has been removed in favor of the direct and simple use of the second person” (The Greek HistoriansI, p. v). Ten years after the ML edition was published Linscott suggested the addition of a frontispiece map with the place names Herodotus used in italics and their modern equivalents in roman type. He thought that modern readers couldn’t follow the narrative without such a map (Linscott to Cerf, 15 September 1957). The map does not appear to have been added. The Persian Warssold 5,578 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first quarter of ML sales. Sales totaled 53,341 copies by spring 1958.",
