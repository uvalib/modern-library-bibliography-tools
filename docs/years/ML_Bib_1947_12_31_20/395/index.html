Signed: McKnight Kauffer. Front flap: For those who want laughter,The Best of S. J. Perelmanis just [±exactly] what the doctor ordered. It is a cure for nearly everything that ails a melancholy world. The knife of Perelman’s wit and wisdom is sharpened on the boot of satire. The incomparable parodist, he takes a cut at books, advertising, magazines, publishers, the movies, columnists, socialites and even himself—and they are [+all] the better for his keen scalpel and deft hand. Perelman is at his best in this book of fifty [+hilarious] pieces, each one warranted [+as a tonic to your sense of humor and guaranteed] to keep you healthy with laughter. (Spring 1947) [Spring 1957] Originally published by Random House, 1944, asCrazy Like a Fox. ML edition (pp. 3–269) printed from RH plates with minor revisions suggested by Perelman, running heads omitted, dedication to Robert C. Benchley added, and the table of contents reset in the style of the Random House edition to reflect the addition of the introduction and four stories on pp. 270–300. Page numerals (vii–viii) were added to the reset table of contents. Publication announced for January 1947.WR10 May 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Reprinted (pp. [v]–xiv, 3–300) in Vintage Books, May 1973, using offset lithographic plates photographically reduced from the ML edition, with title, half title, and fly title reverting toCrazy Like a Fox. The ML paid Perelman royalties of 10 cents a copy, double the rate specified for a ML reprint in the Random House contract (Perelman to Cerf, 22 September 1946). Perelman wrote a new introduction for the ML edition under the name “Sidney Namlerep” and sent four additional pieces: “Physician, Steel Thyself,” “Pale Hands I Loathe,” “Insert Flap ‘A’ and Throw Away,” and “Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer.” He hoped that the additional pieces could be inserted within the text rather than added at the end but recognized that that might not be possible sinceCrazy Like a Foxplates were being used. He also asked to change the dedication from “For Laura and Abby Laura” (his wife and daughter) to “To Robert C. Benchley” (Perelman to Klopfer, 2 December 1946). The dedication in the Random House edition was printed on the verso of the title page; the dedication to Benchley in the Modern Library edition appeared on a leaf of its own. Perelman suggested McKnight Kauffer as the jacket designer for the ML edition. Five years earlier, after meeting with Saxe Commins in connection with his forthcoming bookThe Dream Department(Random House, 1943), he commented, “On the way out after leaving you, I looked at some of McKnight Kauffer’s jackets for Modern Library titles. He’s wonderful; I really would love to have him do a jacket for the book if it could be arranged” (Perelman to Commins, “Tuesday” [6 October 1942]). Kauffer designed the jackets forThe Dream Departmentand the Random House trade edition ofCrazy Like a Foxas well as the jacket for the ML edition. Perelman also emphasized that it was important to proofreadCrazy Like a Foxcarefully, and he asked for several changes in the text, of which the most notable was changing “total recall” to “O’Hara’s disease” (p. 53). Other changes included changing “rif ling” to “riffling” (p. 47), “jack boots” to “jackboots” (p. 88), and “compound fracture” to “greenstick fracture” (p. 184). Negotiations concerning the publication ofThe Best of S. J. Perelmanbetween Cerf and Perelman’s agent, Alan Collins of Curtis Brown, Ltd., were not harmonious. Prior to publication Cerf wrote Collins: “I would like to state here very clearly that we will carry out our contract for the Perelman anthology in the Modern Library and that, thereafter, we have not the faintest interest in future writings by Mr. Perelman” (Cerf to Collins, 18 November 1946). Random House published five books by Perelman between 1937 and 1946. His next book was published by Reynal & Hitchcock; thereafter he settled into a long-term publishing relationship with Simon & Schuster.",
