<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1953</h1>
<h2>1953</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Three new series directed at the juvenile market were launched in 1953:
Landmark Books, Allabout Books, and Gateway Books. The Landmark Books
were phenomenally successful. By 1956 their sales reached 6,000,000
copies. They became a staple of the juvenile market, much as the Modern
Library was a staple of the adult trade. In 1954, Cerf commented, “Our
business gross continues to be fine, but more and more it’s the staples
and Modern Library and Landmarks. The new novels are simply not selling
at all” (Cerf to Klopfer, 15 September 1954).</p>
<p>Saxe Commins, officially the editor-in-chief for the Modern Library,
suffered a heart attack in August 1953 and had little involvement with
the Modern Library thereafter. Jess Stein was placed in charge of the
Modern Library during Commins’s illness and he remained in charge after
Commins’s return. Responsibility for the series was added to his
existing oversight for the Modern Library College Editions.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Nine titles were added, four titles were discontinued, and one title was
superseded. Titles in the list now numbered 295.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Beginning in fall 1953, ML jacket flaps were printed in sans serif type;
the back panel of the jacket was also redesigned using sans serif type.
The first title with jacket flap text in sans serif type was Shaw, <em>Four
Plays</em> (458).</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>$1.25.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Gunther, <em>Death Be Not Proud</em> xShaw, <em>Four Plays</em>; Giants
through G76 (=fall 1952); jackets: 365. (Fall) Shaw, <em>Four Plays</em>
xByron, <em>Selected Poetry</em>; Giants through G77; jackets: 367. <em>Note:</em>
Several fall 1953 titles were published in jackets with spring 1953
lists.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf wanted to publish a ML edition of Alan Paton’s <em>Cry, the Beloved
Country</em> and offered Scribner’s a $5,000 advance against royalties of 12
cents a copy, but the offer was declined (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to
Cerf, 5 May 1953). He also expressed interest in a volume of Frank
O’Connor short stories (Cerf to O’Connor, 25 May 1953). Joseph Prescott
suggested Faulkner’s <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> for the ML (Prescott to ML,
20 February 1953). Gordon S. Haight of Yale University repeated his
suggestion for <em>Middlemarch</em>, writing, “You would be amazed at the
English opinion of the book—men like Basil Willey, V. Pritchett, etc.
rank it beside <em>War and Peace</em>” (Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953).
<em>Middlemarch</em> (636) was not added to the ML until 1984, thirty-one years
later.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The literature of ancient Greece has had a most pervasive influence on
the culture of the Western world. It has therefore long been the
purpose of the editors of the Modern Library to provide general
readers with the widest possible selection from the works of Homer,
Pindar, Sappho and other great poets of antiquity, in the best
available prose or verse translations. This volume preserves the rich
heritage of Greek song and revives the legends of the great warriors
and lovers who inspired them. (<em>Fall 1952</em>)</p>

Discontinued 1969.</p>
<p>Hadas received a flat fee of $1,000 for his editorial work and paid the
cost of permissions and secretarial services out of his fee. The
contract was signed 24 January 1952; the manuscript (except for the
introduction) was delivered three months later. Kenneth Rexroth disliked
the volume. He told the RH editor David McDowell: “Honest—that ML Greek
Poets is awful. ‘Dedicated to proving the proposition that Western
European literature is founded on the work of a number of vulgar
sentimentalists who wrote illiterate doggerel.’ As somebody once said.
Don’t these classics professors have <em>any</em> taste at all?” (Rexroth to
McDowell, 1 May 1953).</p>
<p>Sales totaled 12,984 copies by spring 1958.</p>
<p>An internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that <em>The Greek Poets</em> could not
be shifted to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series, because of
permissions problems. A decision was made at that time to retain it in
the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity as economically feasible
(Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November 1968).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Margaret Mead’s study of adolescence in a primitive civilization has
become one of the classics of modern anthropological research. Even
more than a scientific observer of folkways, Margaret Mead was an
actual participant in the communal life of a Samoa untouched by
Western culture. This record of the psycho-sexual development of pagan
youth is an intimate and fascinating contribution to anthropology,
ethnography, sociology and psychology. By her comparisons between
primitive and modern attitudes toward eroticism, the emotional
differences in two remote social and cultural orders are brilliantly
illuminated. <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> is a book of enduring scientific
and literary importance. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>

1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1958.</p>
<p>Mead was invited to select one of her books for inclusion in the ML. Her
reasons for choosing <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> are discussed in the
preface to the ML edition. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind,
and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I
have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never
write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.”
I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it
contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are
less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim,
by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come
to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the
way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems
to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the
years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very
fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the
limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the
potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social
invention—are far less likely to seem dated. (p. [<em>10</em>])</p>

With his first book, John O’Hara emphatically made his presence felt
among the foremost writers of America. The appearance of <em>Appointment

the unqualified enthusiasm of readers everywhere. Upon the foundation
of this first book, John O’Hara has built his reputation through
subsequent novels and collections of short stories until today his
position in the front ranks of contemporary novelists is unchallenged.
For the Modern Library edition of <em>Appointment in Samarra</em>, John
O’Hara contributes a revealing Foreword, setting forth with rare

and the personal meanings it has for him. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>

Countless afflicted and sorrowing people from every part of the world
have found solace and inspiration in this testament to the heroism of
young John Gunther who died at the age of seventeen after a gallant
but losing fight against the ravages of a brain tumor. The record of
his brief life, so tenderly and poignantly portrayed, is the story not
so much of suffering and death, but of courage and consideration and
selflessness. Besides being one of the rare consolatory books in the
world’s literature, it has become immeasurably influential in the
campaign to combat cancer. For this edition of <em>Death Be Not Proud</em>,
John Gunther writes a new and profoundly moving account of the
influences this memoir has had on the fortunate as well as the sorely
stricken everywhere. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
For many years the editors of the Modern Library sought to include in
the series a representative collection of plays by Bernard Shaw. Until
now all their efforts were in vain because the author was adamant in
his determination that no selection from his works could be issued
during his lifetime in a reprint series. Finally, by special
arrangement with Bernard Shaw’s American publishers (Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.)
and his estate, we are able to fulfill the twenty-five-year hope and
offer in a single volume four of the major plays, with the famous
prefaces complete and unabridged. An Introduction by Louis
Kronenberger matches the brilliance and perception of the Shavian
plays. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 24 October 1953. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Stein prepared a list of six of Shaw’s plays that he considered
desirable for a ML collection: <em>Arms and the Man</em>, <em>Candida</em>, <em>Major
Barbara</em>, <em>Pygmalion</em>, <em>Heartbreak House</em>, and <em>Saint Joan</em>. The only
important play omitted, he told Cerf, was <em>Man and Superman</em> which had a
very long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final
selection, including the addition of <em>Caesar and Cleopatra</em>, was
probably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction
(Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953).</p>
<p>It was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure
permission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight
control over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of
his plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his
opposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a
million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies
each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to
publish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s, <em>Four Plays</em> and <em>Saint
Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion</em> (1956: 484). The only other
volume by Shaw in the ML was his early novel <em>An Unsocial Socialist</em>
(15), published in the series in fall 1917. Originally published in
1887, four years before the United States extended the possibility of
U.S. copyright to works by foreign authors, it was in the U.S. public
domain.</p>

The novel by which Robert Penn Warren compelled immediate national
attention and for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 has
already established itself as one of the notable books in all American
fiction. His story of Willie Stark, the power-impelled, back-country
demagogue, driven and corrupted by success, is a drama of many
strands. Interwoven among them all is the central figure of a rogue
strong and charming and ruthless enough to seduce either a close
friend or an unruly mob. For intensity of action, for an unfailing ear
for native colloquialism and for insight into the character and
motivations of a man drunk with the compulsion to power, there is no
comparable American novel. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>

<p>The Harcourt, Brace plates were too large for the ML’s format. The ML
made its own set of offset plates from the Harcourt, Brace edition and
paid royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf thanked Edward Hodge of
Harcourt, Brace for a royalty concession that made it possible to
include the book in the ML at “a cost within reason” (Cerf to Hodge, 15
January 1953). The ML edition sold well despite competition from a
Bantam paperback. There were eighteen ML impressions between September
1953 and April 1971 for a total of 113,000 copies (Grimshaw, <em>Robert
Penn Warren: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1922–79</em>, p. 38; total number

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The enormous influence Hegel has exercised on modern politics and
philosophy, on social science, anthropology and psychology demands an
examination and evaluation of his most important works, so presented
and annotated as to make them comprehensible in themselves and in
their relationship to the contemporary world. The essence of Hegelian
thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor
Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history,
philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are
faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general
reader. <em>The Philosophy of Hegel</em> becomes another addition to the
Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such
philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant,
Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 24 October 1953. First
printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Friedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a
copy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his
edition of <em>The Philosophy of Kant</em> (422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14
December 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the
job” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to
the ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a
devout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept.
think of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late
1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly
all of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations
about its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead
(Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951).</p>
<p>Friedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of
selections from <em>The Philosophy of History</em> and about fifty pages of
<em>Lectures on Aesthetics</em> and <em>Philosophy of Right and Law</em>. The
translation of the main part of <em>The Philosophy of History</em> is based on
the John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in
1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that
he was having to do more work on the translations than he originally
hoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952).</p>
<p>In the first printing the selections from the Introduction to <em>The</em>
<em>Philosophy of History</em> (460a, pp. [1]–43) are from “a translation
made by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor,
and published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)”
(“Note,” p. [2]). Beginning with the second printing the selections
from the Introduction (460b, pp. [1]–43) are “translated by Carl J.
Friedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind
permission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p.
[2]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first
printing and resetting pp. [1]–42 has not been ascertained.</p>
<p>Friedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold
reasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and
gratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to
Klopfer, 18 January 1960).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The figure of William Blake, poet and prophet, visionary and romantic,
exerts a perennial fascination for all lovers of literature. Now, to
join its ever-growing representation of the great English poets, the
Modern Library makes available a distinguished volume of Blake’s work,
including some of his illustrations, chosen by Northrop Frye of the
University of Toronto. In addition to selections from the lyrics and
shorter poems, from the “prophetic books” such as <em>The Four Zoas</em>,
<em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>, there is a generous section of prose which
includes letters and some epigrammatic and revealing marginalia.
Professor Frye’s Introduction provides a commentary which illuminates
both the simplicity of the lyrics and the difficult but consistent
symbolism of the prophecies. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication originally announced for spring
1953; published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1953. First printing: 6,000
copies. Discontinued 1973/74; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>“The definitive edition is that of Geoffrey Keynes, <em>The Writings of
William Blake</em> (3 vols., 1925), reprinted in one volume as <em>The Poetry
and Prose of William Blake</em> (4th ed., 1948). The present text, with some
rearrangement, reproduces Keynes’s text” (p. xxx).</p>
<p>Frye received a flat fee of $350 for writing the introduction and
selecting the contents (Stein to Frye, 16 May 1952; 29 May 1952).</p>
<p>Frye made a series of extracts from <em>The Four Zoas</em>, <em>Milton</em>, and
<em>Jerusalem</em>. He told Stein, “I have a strong personal repugnance to
bits-and-pieces anthologizing, and do this only because I don’t at the
moment see anything better to do” (Frye to Stein, 27 September 1952). So
little of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get
it all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the
shorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early
prose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they
belonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia
were included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye
to Stein, 5 December 1952). Frye suggested the inclusion of the
illustrations (Frye to Stein, 9 June 1952). The original plan was to use
ten illustrations, but the number was reduced to eight so they could be
bound in as a four-leaf gathering.</p>

Nowhere is the brilliant, brittle world of Restoration England more
faithfully mirrored than in the dramas of that period. In this new
volume—for the same enjoyment now that others found then—are the best
plays of those colorful years. Here are not only the deeply moving
tragedies of Dryden and Otway, but, more importantly perhaps, the
ageless comedies of Etherege, Congreve, Wycherley and
Vanbrugh—comedies that captured the fine manners, the shimmering wit
and the constant intrigue of the gay aristocratic gallants and their
ladies. (<em>Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published fall 1953. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1953.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Harris received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and
selecting the plays. Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven
plays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid
all but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact
upon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read
and enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to
Harris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and
recommended omitting <em>The Beaux’ Stratagem</em> if only six could be
published. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to
add <em>The Rehearsal</em> (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the
number of pages required and agreed to its inclusion.</p>
<p><em>Restoration Plays</em> and <em>Eighteenth-Century Plays</em> (1952: 448) were
conceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected
the plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using
the first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe
that a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to
Harris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to
set <em>Restoration Plays</em> from first editions of all of the plays except
<em>The Rehearsal</em>, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition
(Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured
photostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A
textual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for
<em>Eighteenth-Century Plays</em> appears on p. [iv] of <em>Restoration Plays</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first
editions. The sole exception is <em>The Rehearsal</em>, which is based upon
the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that
edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author.</p>
<p>A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early
editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in
spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small
number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The
volume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was
twice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the
regular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary
to Harris, 5 May 1953).</p>

For a wide range of haunting moods and of forms of creative
expression, turn to this volume of writings by Edgar Allan Poe. At
once the master of the lyric poem of incomparable magic and the short
story of brilliant inventiveness, Poe has influenced untold numbers of
poets and writers, and even today’s science fiction remains greatly in
his debt. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also provided
notes creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet, short-story
writer, literary critic and essayist. Rarely, indeed, can a single
volume devoted to a single author present such memorable achievements
in various fields of literary effort. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe is one of the most original writers in American
letters. His artistic penetration into the heart of things is still
being analyzed and discussed with increasing awareness of its depth
and complexity. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also
provided notes, creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet,
short-story writer, literary critic and essayist. It presents a
comprehensive view of the man whose influence on American as well as
European literature was profound. The art of the short story in
America was significantly advanced by Poe, who also shaped the
development of the detective story.</p>
<p>Poe’s ability to blend the macabre and surreal with consummate
craftsmanship has remained a memorable contribution to American
literature. (<em>Spring/Fall 1968</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML collection superseding <em>The Best Tales of Edgar Allan Poe</em>
(112). Published in MLCE June 1951 and in the regular ML fall 1953. <em>WR</em>
not found. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Mabbott received a flat fee of $250 for writing the introduction and
selecting the contents. Stein sent him an additional $100 when the
collection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June
1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been
determined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD
ARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However,
it occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we
have a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poem <em>The
Sleeper</em> on the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in
the final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He
suggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether
(Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950).</p>
<p><em>How to Write a Blackwood Article</em> does not appear in <em>The Selected
Poetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe</em>, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in
the introduction appears to have been cut. <em>The Sleeper</em> is included in
its final text.</p>
<p>“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A.
Harrison’s <em>Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe</em> by the kind permission of
the publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed
from the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case of <em>The
Cask of Amontillado</em>, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In
one or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but
preferred by most critics. Poe was a meticulous and thorough reviser of
his imaginative works, and instances of unwise revision are
exceptionally rare.” (“Note,” p. xvi)</p>

The Landmark Books\nwere phenomenally successful. By 1956 their sales reached 6,000,000\ncopies. They became a staple of the juvenile market, much as the Modern\nLibrary was a staple of the adult trade. In 1954, Cerf commented, “Our\nbusiness gross continues to be fine, but more and more it’s the staples\nand Modern Library and Landmarks. The new novels are simply not selling\nat all” (Cerf to Klopfer, 15 September 1954).\n\nSaxe Commins, officially the editor-in-chief for the Modern Library,\nsuffered a heart attack in August 1953 and had little involvement with\nthe Modern Library thereafter. Jess Stein was placed in charge of the\nModern Library during Commins’s illness and he remained in charge after\nCommins’s return. Responsibility for the series was added to his\nexisting oversight for the Modern Library College Editions.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nNine titles were added, four titles were discontinued, and one title was\nsuperseded. Titles in the list now numbered 295.\n\n### Format\n\nBeginning in fall 1953, ML jacket flaps were printed in sans serif type;\nthe back panel of the jacket was also redesigned using sans serif type.\nThe first title with jacket flap text in sans serif type was Shaw, *Four\nPlays* (458).\n\n### Price\n\n$1.25.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Gunther, *Death Be Not Proud* xShaw, *Four Plays*; Giants\nthrough G76 (=fall 1952); jackets: 365. (Fall) Shaw, *Four Plays*\nxByron, *Selected Poetry*; Giants through G77; jackets: 367. *Note:*\nSeveral fall 1953 titles were published in jackets with spring 1953\nlists.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf wanted to publish a ML edition of Alan Paton’s *Cry, the Beloved\nCountry* and offered Scribner’s a $5,000 advance against royalties of 12\ncents a copy, but the offer was declined (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to\nCerf, 5 May 1953). He also expressed interest in a volume of Frank\nO’Connor short stories (Cerf to O’Connor, 25 May 1953). Joseph Prescott\nsuggested Faulkner’s *Intruder in the Dust* for the ML (Prescott to ML,\n20 February 1953). Gordon S. Haight of Yale University repeated his\nsuggestion for *Middlemarch*, writing, “You would be amazed at the\nEnglish opinion of the book—men like Basil Willey, V. Pritchett, etc.\nrank it beside *War and Peace*” (Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953).\n*Middlemarch* (636) was not added to the ML until 1984, thirty-one years\nlater.\n\n### New titles\n\nHadas, ed., *Greek Poets* (1953) 454\n\nMead, *Coming of Age in Samoa* (1953) 455\n\nO’Hara, *Appointment in Samarra* (1953) 456\n\nGunther, *Death Be Not Proud* (1953) 457\n\nShaw, *Four Plays* (1953) 458\n\nWarren, *All the King’s Men* (1953) 459\n\nHegel, *Philosophy of Hegel* (1953) 460\n\nBlake, *Selected Poetry and Prose of William Blake* (1953) 461\n\n*Restoration Plays* (1953) 462\n\nPoe, *Selected Poetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe* (1953) 463### Discontinued\n\nHemingway, *Farewell to Arms* (1932)\\*\n\nHemingway, *Sun Also Rises* (1930)\\*\n\nLewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933)\n\nPoe, *Best Tales of Edgar Allan Poe* (1924)\\*\\*\n\nSnow, *Red Star Over China* (1944)\n\n\\*Scribner’s withdrew Hemingway’s works from the ML when it launched its\nquality paperback series The Scribner Library, which drew its titles\nfrom the Scribner backlist.\n\n\\*\\*Superseded by Poe, *Selected Poetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe*,\nedited by T. O.

The\ncontract was signed 24 January 1952; the manuscript (except for the\nintroduction) was delivered three months later. Kenneth Rexroth disliked\nthe volume. He told the RH editor David McDowell: “Honest—that ML Greek\nPoets is awful. ‘Dedicated to proving the proposition that Western\nEuropean literature is founded on the work of a number of vulgar\nsentimentalists who wrote illiterate doggerel.’ As somebody once said.\nDon’t these classics professors have *any* taste at all?” (Rexroth to\nMcDowell, 1 May 1953).\n\nSales totaled 12,984 copies by spring 1958.\n\nAn internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that *The Greek Poets* could not\nbe shifted to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series, because of\npermissions problems. A decision was made at that time to retain it in\nthe ML but to reprint in as small a quantity as economically feasible\n(Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November 1968).\n\n### 455\n\n**MARGARET MEAD.

Her\nreasons for choosing *Coming of Age in Samoa* are discussed in the\npreface to the ML edition. She writes:\n\n> My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind,\n> and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I\n> have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never\n> write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.”\n> I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it\n> contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are\n> less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim,\n> by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come\n> to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the\n> way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems\n> to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the\n> years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very\n> fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the\n> limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the\n> potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social\n> invention—are far less likely to seem dated.

The only\nimportant play omitted, he told Cerf, was *Man and Superman* which had a\nvery long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final\nselection, including the addition of *Caesar and Cleopatra*, was\nprobably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction\n(Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953).\n\nIt was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure\npermission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight\ncontrol over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of\nhis plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a\nmillion copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies\neach—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to\npublish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s, *Four Plays* and *Saint\nJoan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956: 484). The only other\nvolume by Shaw in the ML was his early novel *An Unsocial Socialist*\n(15), published in the series in fall 1917.

The essence of Hegelian\n> thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor\n> Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history,\n> philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are\n> faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general\n> reader. *The Philosophy of Hegel* becomes another addition to the\n> Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such\n> philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant,\n> Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (*Fall 1953*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1953. *WR* 24 October 1953. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nFriedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a\ncopy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his\nedition of *The Philosophy of Kant* (422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14\nDecember 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the\njob” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to\nthe ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a\ndevout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept.\nthink of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late\n1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly\nall of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations\nabout its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead\n(Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951).\n\nFriedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of\nselections from *The Philosophy of History* and about fifty pages of\n*Lectures on Aesthetics* and *Philosophy of Right and Law*. The\ntranslation of the main part of *The Philosophy of History* is based on\nthe John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in\n1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that\nhe was having to do more work on the translations than he originally\nhoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952).\n\nIn the first printing the selections from the Introduction to *The*\n*Philosophy of History* (460a, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are from “a translation\nmade by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor,\nand published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)”\n(“Note,” p. \\[2\\]). Beginning with the second printing the selections\nfrom the Introduction (460b, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are “translated by Carl J.\nFriedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind\npermission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p.\n\\[2\\]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first\nprinting and resetting pp. \\[1\\]–42 has not been ascertained.\n\nFriedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold\nreasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and\ngratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to\nKlopfer, 18 January 1960).\n\n**460b.

He told Stein, “I have a strong personal repugnance to\nbits-and-pieces anthologizing, and do this only because I don’t at the\nmoment see anything better to do” (Frye to Stein, 27 September 1952). So\nlittle of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get\nit all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the\nshorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early\nprose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they\nbelonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia\nwere included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye\nto Stein, 5 December 1952). Frye suggested the inclusion of the\nillustrations (Frye to Stein, 9 June 1952).

Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nHarris received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and\nselecting the plays. Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven\nplays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid\nall but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact\nupon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read\nand enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to\nHarris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and\nrecommended omitting *The Beaux’ Stratagem* if only six could be\npublished. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to\nadd *The Rehearsal* (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the\nnumber of pages required and agreed to its inclusion.\n\n*Restoration Plays* and *Eighteenth-Century Plays* (1952: 448) were\nconceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected\nthe plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using\nthe first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe\nthat a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to\nHarris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to\nset *Restoration Plays* from first editions of all of the plays except\n*The Rehearsal*, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition\n(Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured\nphotostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A\ntextual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for\n*Eighteenth-Century Plays* appears on p. \\[iv\\] of *Restoration Plays*:\n\n> The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first\n> editions. The sole exception is *The Rehearsal*, which is based upon\n> the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that\n> edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author.\n>\n> A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early\n> editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in\n> spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small\n> number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.\n\nHarris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The\nvolume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was\ntwice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the\nregular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary\nto Harris, 5 May 1953).\n\n### 463\n\n**EDGAR ALLAN POE.

Stein sent him an additional $100 when the\ncollection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June\n1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been\ndetermined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD\nARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However,\nit occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we\nhave a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poem *The\nSleeper* on the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in\nthe final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He\nsuggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether\n(Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950).\n\n*How to Write a Blackwood Article* does not appear in *The Selected\nPoetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe*, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in\nthe introduction appears to have been cut. *The Sleeper* is included in\nits final text.\n\n“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A.\nHarrison’s *Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe* by the kind permission of\nthe publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed\nfrom the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case of *The\nCask of Amontillado*, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In\none or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but\npreferred by most critics.

The descriptions of Samoan life are\n> less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim,\n> by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come\n> to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the\n> way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems\n> to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the\n> years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very\n> fast.

The only\nimportant play omitted, he told Cerf, was *Man and Superman* which had a\nvery long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final\nselection, including the addition of *Caesar and Cleopatra*, was\nprobably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction\n(Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953).\n\nIt was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure\npermission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight\ncontrol over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of\nhis plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a\nmillion copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies\neach—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to\npublish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s, *Four Plays* and *Saint\nJoan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956: 484).

Friedrich.\n\n*Jacket:* Predominantly non-pictorial in light greenish gray (154) and\nblack on coated white paper with lettering in black except “HEGEL” in\ntitle and torchbearer in reverse; decorative drawing of branches of\nleaves below title.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The enormous influence Hegel has exercised on modern politics and\n> philosophy, on social science, anthropology and psychology demands an\n> examination and evaluation of his most important works, so presented\n> and annotated as to make them comprehensible in themselves and in\n> their relationship to the contemporary world. The essence of Hegelian\n> thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor\n> Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history,\n> philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are\n> faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general\n> reader. *The Philosophy of Hegel* becomes another addition to the\n> Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such\n> philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant,\n> Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (*Fall 1953*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1953. *WR* 24 October 1953. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nFriedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a\ncopy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his\nedition of *The Philosophy of Kant* (422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14\nDecember 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the\njob” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to\nthe ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a\ndevout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept.\nthink of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late\n1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly\nall of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations\nabout its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead\n(Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951).\n\nFriedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of\nselections from *The Philosophy of History* and about fifty pages of\n*Lectures on Aesthetics* and *Philosophy of Right and Law*. The\ntranslation of the main part of *The Philosophy of History* is based on\nthe John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in\n1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that\nhe was having to do more work on the translations than he originally\nhoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952).\n\nIn the first printing the selections from the Introduction to *The*\n*Philosophy of History* (460a, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are from “a translation\nmade by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor,\nand published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)”\n(“Note,” p. \\[2\\]). Beginning with the second printing the selections\nfrom the Introduction (460b, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are “translated by Carl J.\nFriedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind\npermission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p.\n\\[2\\]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first\nprinting and resetting pp. \\[1\\]–42 has not been ascertained.\n\nFriedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold\nreasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and\ngratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to\nKlopfer, 18 January 1960).\n\n**460b.

The present text, with some\nrearrangement, reproduces Keynes’s text” (p. xxx).\n\nFrye received a flat fee of $350 for writing the introduction and\nselecting the contents (Stein to Frye, 16 May 1952; 29 May 1952).\n\nFrye made a series of extracts from *The Four Zoas*, *Milton*, and\n*Jerusalem*. He told Stein, “I have a strong personal repugnance to\nbits-and-pieces anthologizing, and do this only because I don’t at the\nmoment see anything better to do” (Frye to Stein, 27 September 1952). So\nlittle of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get\nit all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the\nshorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early\nprose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they\nbelonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia\nwere included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye\nto Stein, 5 December 1952). Frye suggested the inclusion of the\nillustrations (Frye to Stein, 9 June 1952). The original plan was to use\nten illustrations, but the number was reduced to eight so they could be\nbound in as a four-leaf gathering.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nBlake, *Poems* (1921) 92\n\nBlake, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne & Complete\nPoetry of William Blake* (Giant, 1946) G71"

(*Spring 1953*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published fall 1953. *WR* 19 September 1953.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nHarris received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and\nselecting the plays. Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven\nplays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid\nall but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact\nupon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read\nand enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to\nHarris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and\nrecommended omitting *The Beaux’ Stratagem* if only six could be\npublished. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to\nadd *The Rehearsal* (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the\nnumber of pages required and agreed to its inclusion.\n\n*Restoration Plays* and *Eighteenth-Century Plays* (1952: 448) were\nconceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected\nthe plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using\nthe first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe\nthat a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to\nHarris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to\nset *Restoration Plays* from first editions of all of the plays except\n*The Rehearsal*, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition\n(Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured\nphotostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A\ntextual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for\n*Eighteenth-Century Plays* appears on p. \\[iv\\] of *Restoration Plays*:\n\n> The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first\n> editions. The sole exception is *The Rehearsal*, which is based upon\n> the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that\n> edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author.\n>\n> A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early\n> editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in\n> spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small\n> number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.\n\nHarris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The\nvolume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was\ntwice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the\nregular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary\nto Harris, 5 May 1953)."

Stein sent him an additional $100 when the\ncollection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June\n1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been\ndetermined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD\nARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However,\nit occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we\nhave a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poem *The\nSleeper* on the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in\nthe final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He\nsuggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether\n(Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950).\n\n*How to Write a Blackwood Article* does not appear in *The Selected\nPoetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe*, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in\nthe introduction appears to have been cut. *The Sleeper* is included in\nits final text.\n\n“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A.\nHarrison’s *Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe* by the kind permission of\nthe publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed\nfrom the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case of *The\nCask of Amontillado*, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In\none or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but\npreferred by most critics. Poe was a meticulous and thorough reviser of\nhis imaginative works, and instances of unwise revision are\nexceptionally rare.” (“Note,” p. xvi)\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nPoe, *Best Tales* (1924) 112\n\nPoe, *Complete Tales and Poems* (Giant, 1938) G38"
