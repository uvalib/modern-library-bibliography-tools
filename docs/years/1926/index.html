<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1926</h1>
<h2>1926</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer did not discontinue any Modern Library titles in 1926
and added twelve new titles to the series, bringing the total number of
active titles to 125. One of the additions was Beerbohm, <em>Zuleika
Dobson</em>, which had been in the Boni &amp; Liveright series between 1918 and
1922. <em>Zuleika Dobson</em> may have been withdrawn from the series by Dodd,
Mead &amp; Co., which made a new printing of its own in 1924. Two years
later Cerf and Klopfer were able to restore it to the series. All
families of printings of <em>Zuleika Dobson</em> in the ML, including those
between 1926 and 1970 (36c‑d), are described in the chapter for 1918.</p>
<h3>Format and printing</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding
measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼
in. (164 x 107 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm).</p>
<p>Most ML books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of
the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>

of the sheet and bound as gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956
most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet
and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<p>ML books were printed by the Ferris Printing Co. in New York City during
the early months of 1926. Later in the year the ML switched to Parkway
Printing Co., 400 Lafayette St., New York City. Parkway continued to
print all ML books for decades to come except for a small number of
titles before the 1960s that were printed by offset lithography.</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>Elmer Adler, proprietor of the Pynson Press in New York, redesigned the
ML title page. He retained the basic design inherited from B&amp;L but made
the title page more elegant and appealing. He replaced the B&amp;L
double-rule frame with a frame consisting of a thick outer rule and thin
inner rule, used open-face type for the title, and eliminated the rule</p>
<p>between THE MODERN LIBRARY and the last line of the title page. He also
changed PUBLISHERS :: :: NEW YORK to the less cluttered PUBLISHERS · NEW
YORK and then, beginning with the third title published in 1926, to the
more distinctive PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK. He also enlarged Bernhard’s
torchbearer from 18 to 26 mm (torchbearer A2). The first version of
Adler’s title page was used in January with Brontë’s <em>Wuthering
Heights</em>; the latter version was introduced with Wilde’s <em>De Profundis</em>
in April. Adler’s basic title page design remained in use through 1939
with changes in the imprint area in 1931 and 1936.</p>
<p>In general, titles from the B&amp;L era were provided with Adler title pages
only when the text was reset or augmented with new content. Examples
include Flaubert, <em>Madame Bovary</em> (25.2a) in 1927 and Gautier,
<em>Mademoiselle de Maupin &amp; One of Cleopatra’s Nights</em> (51g) in 1935.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine
lettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Bernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown.</p>
<h3>Jacket</h3>
<p>The first two 1926 titles, Brontë, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (120) and
Anderson, <em>Poor White</em> (121), were published in uniform typographic
jacket B1 with no torchbearer on the front panel, “The Modern Library”
in upper- and lowercase letters on a deep reddish orange band near the
bottom of the front panel, and a list of ML titles on the flaps and back
panel. All other titles added to the series in 1926 were published in
uniform typographic jacket B2, with Bernhard’s torchbearer added to the
front panel above the descriptive text and “THE MODERN LIBRARY” printed
in uppercase letters on the deep reddish orange band near the bottom of
the front panel.</p>
<p>Uniform typographic jacket B2 and later jackets have the following text
on the front and back flaps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>95¢ net ($1 in Canada)
<em>On the inside of this jacket is a list, arranged alphabetically by
authors, of all the titles in</em> <span class="smallcaps">the modern
library</span><em>. It is worthy of your attention.</em></p>
<p>════</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">the modern library,</span> in less than ten
years, has become the most important collection of attractively priced
books of the better kind in America, its scope constantly growing, and
its popularity spreading to every corner of the world where English
books are read.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious. <span class="smallcaps">modern library</span>
books give full value. Titles are selected with rigid care to
represent the very best in modern literature and thought. Constant
improvement is being effected in the manufacture of the books. They
are printed from new, clear type, on a superior quality paper and
bound in full limp fashion, the tops stained and the decorations in
genuine gold. They will fit into any pocket and are ideal for a
journey or the library table. Their introductions are brilliant and
authoritative; a list of the men who have contributed introductions to
<span class="smallcaps">the modern library</span> reads like a
Literary “Who’s Who” of America.</p>
<p>The notion is an obvious one to express but bears repeating: it is
possible for a poor man to gather unto himself a library as extensive
and as “correct” as any bibliophile if he will make use of <span
class="smallcaps">the modern library</span> and kindred series of
older classics. One book a week, at a cost scarcely noticeable, and in
time one may harvest for his own consumption the wisdom and the dreams
of the ages!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This text was used without revision on jacket flaps through July 1933.
Beginning with Brontë, <em>Jane Eyre</em> (260) in August 1933 the front flaps
have descriptive text about individual titles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The back panel of uniform typographic jacket B2 states:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Are you pleased with</em>
<em>this</em> <span class="smallcaps">modern library</span> <em>book?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There must be dozens of other titles in the series that you have
always wanted to read and that you did not know were obtainable at so
low a price. A complete list of the titles of <span
class="smallcaps">the modern library</span> will be found inside of
this jacket. Jot down the numbers of the volumes you desire on the
coupon below and give it to your bookseller. If there is no bookseller
in your neighborhood, the publishers will supply you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The order blank is headed TO YOUR BOOKSELLER; below the order blank the

</blockquote>
<p>The deep reddish orange band near the top of the back panel states:</p>
<blockquote>

<em><span class="smallcaps">the editions are authentic and copyrighted</span></em>

<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer tried to include several titles published by Alfred A.
Knopf after they bought the Modern Library, but Knopf refused to allow
any of his publications to be reprinted in the series. His standards of
production and design were the highest of any major American trade
publisher, and he “did not in those days care to see cheap editions
published of our most distinguished books” (Knopf, letter to GBN, 4 May
1977). Knopf also had other reasons for his coolness toward the ML. He
associated Cerf with Horace Liveright, whom he loathed; in particular he
resented the ML edition of W. H. Hudson’s <em>Green Mansions</em> (90). It was
Knopf’s edition of <em>Green Mansions</em>, published in 1916, that established
the work in the United States, but Knopf did not own the copyright.
<em>Green Mansions</em> was in the U.S. public domain because its original
American publication by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in 1904 used imported sheets
of the English edition. The U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 limited American
copyright to works that were printed and bound in the U.S.; the use of
imported sheets cast a work irretrievably into the U.S. public domain.
When Liveright added <em>Green Mansions</em> to the ML he did not pay royalties
to Knopf. Moreover, he reprinted it with John Galsworthy’s introduction,
which had been written for the Knopf edition but does not appear to have
been copyrighted. Relations between Knopf and the ML remained cool until
January 1929, when a luncheon meeting organized with the help of Blanche
Knopf led to friendly relations between the two firms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before 1929 Cerf appealed directly to several Knopf authors in an
attempt to secure their support for ML editions of their works. He wrote
to Joseph Hergesheimer:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is all very well for us to advertise that our Modern Library
contains books by all the great modern American writers … but I am
extremely conscious of the fact that so long as no book of yours is on
the list, there is a glaring gap that we cannot explain.” He asked
whether “there is no way for us to have one of your books in the
library. I find Mr. Knopf very elusive and vague on the subject of
adding any volumes on which he owns the copyright to our series—a
condition which I very much regret, because as you know, there are
many other items besides your books on his list, which could be put in
the Modern Library, to the advantage of everybody. . . . Is there not
some way in which you can prevail upon Mr. Knopf to let us have one of
your books?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerf indicated that the ML would prefer <em>The Three Black Pennies</em> above
all others (Cerf to Hergesheimer, 30 March 1926). Hergesheimer’s
standing declined in the 1930s, and Cerf did not renew his offer after
relations with Knopf improved.</p>
<p>Another Knopf author that Cerf tried to get for the ML was Arthur
Machen. He was especially interested in Machen’s <em>The House of Souls</em>
(Knopf, 1922) or <em>The Hill of Dreams</em> (Knopf, 1923). During a 1926 visit
to London Cerf took Machen to lunch at Claridge’s and suggested a ML
edition of one of the books. Machen’s American agent indicated that both
books were in the U.S. public domain but that the rights situation was
complicated (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 8 June 1927). Cerf indicated
that Machen “is anxious to see them in the Library; he is, as usual, as
you know, in need of money. However, I believe that we could not do
either of these books without getting into a serious jam with Knopf, and
I would do nothing about them unless we had his definite consent” (Cerf
to Baumgarten, 8 June 1927). Machen also did not want to oppose Knopf in
any way. He wrote: “My reason is that it was he who brought me out in
your country &amp; did everything in his power to make me popular in
America; also that he has paid me extremely handsome fees for writing
introductions. . . . Therefore I should not feel happy in opposing him
in any matter” (Machen to Cerf, 5 July 1926). None of Machen’s books
were reprinted in the ML, but he wrote an introduction to the ML edition
of Smollett’s <em>Expedition of Humphry Clinker</em> (179). Cerf paid him $100
for the introduction, twice the ML’s usual fee.</p>
<p>Other works that Cerf considered adding to the series included
Montesquieu’s <em>Persian Letters</em>, Frank Swinnerton’s <em>Nocturne</em>, and a
volume of Edmond Rostand’s plays to include <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>,
<em>Chanticleer</em>, and <em>L’Aiglon</em>. He asked John Erskine to write an
introduction to <em>Persian Letters</em>, but the volume never appeared (Cerf
to Erskine, 4 October 1926). Swinnerton’s literary agent declined the
offer for <em>Nocturne</em> (Brandt &amp; Brandt to Cerf, 16 October 1926), and the
ML ended up publishing <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> (174) as a separate volume
in 1929.</p>
<p>Horace M. Kallen suggested a volume of Bernard Shaw’s works. Shaw was
opposed to inexpensive reprints of his plays and kept tight control of
his copyrights. Cerf replied, “If you can suggest how in hell’s bells we
can sign Shaw up for such a volume, you will immediately be elected
Patron Saint of the Modern Library” (Cerf to Kallen, 13 October 1926).
It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was
able to publish two collections of his plays. Shaw relaxed his
opposition to inexpensive reprints on one occasion toward the end of his
life. In 1946 he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of
his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the
occasion of his ninetieth birthday.</p>
<p>Henry Hoyns of Harper &amp; Bros. suggested W. E. Woodward’s <em>Bunk</em>, which
Harper’s had published three years earlier (Hoyns to Cerf, 15 March
1926). The Boston publisher Lewis C. Page, who had failed on more than
one occasion to persuade B&amp;L to reprint Gustav Frenssen’s novel
<em>Holyland</em>, repeated his suggestion to the ML’s new owners (Page to ML,
17 September 1926). Page also suggested Balzac’s <em>Physiology of
Marriage</em> for the ML. Cerf responded, “The Lord knows it is dull enough
reading, but the title might make it a good seller, and there is just a
chance that we will be able to make some arrangement with you for its
publication late next year” (Cerf to Page, 16 February 1926). Page
replied, “You are entirely right in your analysis of the literary
qualities and trade appeal. It is heavy reading for Modernists, but the
title is alluring, and we have a steady sale” (Page to Cerf, 19 February
1926).</p>
<h3>Christmas gift boxes</h3>
<p>For the 1926 Christmas season the ML packaged fifty titles in boxed sets
of five volumes each. The ten boxed sets were sold primarily in
department stores and were intended for “that vast army of Christmas
book buyers who like to have their shopping made as simple as possible
for them” (ML ad, <em>PW</em>, 4 September 1926, pp. 803–4). Each set was
devoted to a particular theme and sold for $4.75, the same price as five
volumes purchased separately. Unlike subsequent Christmas gift boxes,
books in the 1926 sets appear to have been indistinguishable from ML
volumes sold separately. None of the boxed sets from 1926 are known to
have survived. The ten sets were:</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Ten gift boxes to choose from may have been too many, and $4.75 may have
been more than many shoppers wished to spend on a gift. The boxed sets
continued to be listed in the ML’s spring–summer 1927 catalog, but there
were no gift boxes for the 1927 holiday season. The following year a
single Christmas gift box of three ML volumes in distinctive jackets and
bindings was offered at $2.85. Three gift boxes of three volumes each
were offered during the 1929 Christmas season.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
‘WUTHERING HEIGHTS’ was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools,
out of homely materials. The statuary found a granite block on a
solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be
elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least
one element of grandeur—power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from
no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the
crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and
frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and
goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of
mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its
blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the
giant’s foot. CHARLOTTE BRONTË</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from duplicate plates of the edition published in
1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. Published January 1926.
<em>WR</em> 6 February 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1969/70. Reissued 1978.</p>
<p>Macaulay had agreed to write an introduction to <em>Wuthering Heights</em> when
the ML was published by B&amp;L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925
(B&amp;L advertisement, <em>PW</em>, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction
failed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just
bought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited
England in June but was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he
wrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a
short introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s
“Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I
would therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction
within a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than
four or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of
$50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6
August 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After
thanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your
own books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an
ideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September
1925).</p>
<p>A slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included
in the British edition of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> published in 1926 in
Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first
paragraph of the introduction concludes with the following three
sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about
these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that
every available fact about their personalities and lives is now
familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at
all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the
poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to
his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired,
never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed
the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put
some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the
words, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives
is now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts
at all.”</p>
<p>Except for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are
printed from identical plates. The only difference is that the
Travellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the
first page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other
Travellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a
duplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement
may have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.</p>
<p>The title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay
(“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.</p>
<p>Blue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay
introduction, for a 1939 printing of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> in its new
reprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and
sold for 39 cents a copy.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed
it 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter
during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably
reflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion
of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> as one of the first titles in Modern Library
College Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for
classroom use.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
‘WUTHERING HEIGHTS’ was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools,
out of homely materials. The statuary found a granite block on a
solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be
elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least
one element of grandeur—power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from
no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the
crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and
frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and
goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of
mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its
blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the
giant’s foot. CHARLOTTE BRONTË (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Emily Brontë’s brooding imagination evoked as thwarted and tragic a
group of human creatures as ever walked the bleak moorlands or had
their existence in the dark byways of life. The barren world in which
their villanies [<em>sic</em>] flourished forms the background for deeds as
weird as they are sinister and for passions as fierce as they are
persistent. <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is by common consent one of the most
compelling novels in the English language. It is a book compact of
beauty and loveliness, hate and cruelty and heartrending pathos.
(<em>Fall 1933</em>) <em>Note:</em> The misspelling of “villainies” is retained on
jacket flaps at least through fall 1952.</p>

<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular
ML. ML edition (pp. xxvii‑xxxii, [1]–400) printed from plates
originally made for the Illustrated Modern Library with pagination of
the Editor’s Preface revised. In ML and MLCE printings Charlotte
Brontë’s Biographical Notice is reset in smaller type to match that of
Gettman’s introduction. ML and MLCE printings include Eichenberg’s
wood-engraved chapter heads that were made for the Book-of-the-Month
Club and the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 18) but not the full-page
wood engravings.</p>
<p>The Illustrated Modern Library edition of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (IML 18),
published in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition of <em>Wuthering
Heights</em> had a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only.
For the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional
wood engravings for the chapter heads. Since <em>Wuthering Heights</em>
consists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice
and one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.</p>
<p>New plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for
subsequent printings of the regular ML edition. This appears to have
been the intention, since the preliminaries for the regular ML edition
of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, including Macaulay’s introduction, were reset to
match the rest of the text. However, the original plates were used when
the regular ML edition of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (120.1c) was reprinted in
fall 1947. No regular ML printings with the reset text have been seen
prior to 120.2a, when the Illustrated Modern Library plates were used
with a new introduction by Royal A. Gettmann.</p>

January 1950).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
POOR WHITE tells the story of the American power that dots a vast
valley with cities overnight, and builds a network of industry, making
quick men rich and fearful men poor. The hero works for this force
although he doesn’t like or understand it. He is a dreamy, rather
stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical
tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made
[<em>sic</em>] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s”
love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a
wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as
the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of
our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic
majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and
develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is
fulfilled. (<em>Fall 1925)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br>
As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a
supreme position among American novelists. <em>Poor White</em>, like
<em>Winesburg, Ohio</em> (No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately
upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary
writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making
men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly
from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the
naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world
celebrated. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking
Press, August 1925. ML edition (pp. [1]–371) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings.
Published February 1926. <em>WR</em> 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000
copies. Discontinued fall 1939.</p>
<p>When Anderson became a B&amp;L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed
interest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including
<em>Poor White</em> in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April
1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s
contract with B&amp;L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately
endeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in
writing, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library”
(contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML
before <em>Poor White</em> could be added to the series. It is not known
whether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or
after the sale.</p>
<p>For writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML
books instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925).
He wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to
be published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to
call on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long
rows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little
like a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city”
(ML ed., p. vi).</p>
<p>The dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was
divorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request
(Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication
was inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Poor White</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th
out of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies
by April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000
copies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
This romance originally published under the title of “The Virgins of
the Rocks”, was written by D’Annunzio when his position as the
greatest modern Italian master of prose was already secure. Other of
his novels in the Modern Library series are “The Flame of Life”,
(volume number 65), “The Child of Pleasure”, (volume number 98), and
“The Triumph of Death”, (volume number 112). (<em>Spring 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by George H. Richmond &amp; Son, 1898, and
subsequently by L. C. Page &amp; Co., 1902. ML edition (pp. [1]–296)
printed from Richmond/Page plates. Publication announced for May 1926.
<em>WR</em> 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1928.</p>
<p>Lewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so
aggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you,
it appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that
are absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the
privilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being,
at least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list,
although some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder
or The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box
128, L. C. Page &amp; Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm
commitment on Liveright’s part to include both <em>The Maidens of the
Rocks</em> and <em>The Intruder</em> in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the
series he demanded that they pay advances of $240 against royalties of 8
cents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him
$480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other
the following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10
September 1925).</p>
<p><em>The Maidens of the Rocks</em> sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the
beginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year.
Page responded with a pitch for <em>The Intruder</em>, noting that it was part
of the trilogy that included <em>The Child of Pleasure</em> and <em>The Flame of
Life</em> and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described
<em>The Maidens of the Rocks</em> as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough
story, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers
of the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind
any of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always
run neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to
the two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He
concluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the
other three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want
children’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page
to Cerf, 7 February 1927).</p>
<p>Cerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The
Intruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the
advance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong
feeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library
with a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
“In this wild, beautiful romance, Herman Melville seems to have spoken
the very secret of the Sea, and to have drawn into his tale all the
magic, all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters. It stands
quite alone; it strikes a note no other sea writer has ever struck. It
is a work not only unique of its kind, but a great achievement—the
expression of an imagination that rises to the highest, and so is
amongst the world’s great works of art.” —<span class="smallcaps">John

illustration was created for the 3-volume limited edition of <em>Moby Dick</em>
published by Lakeside Press in 1930. Later that year Random House
published a one-volume trade edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting; the MLG edition (G65) printed from RH plates appeared in
1944. Kent’s illustration appears on p. 81 of RH/MLG printings. The
reproduction of the illustration on jacket C is slightly cropped at the

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the comparatively few books in the world’s literature about which
it is safe to foretell the verdict of posterity, <em>Moby Dick</em> stands in
the first rank. Universally recognized as one of the greatest of all
tales of the sea, it will live by its own surge and elemental force.
This mighty history of the pursuit of the vindictive monster, upon
which Herman Melville lavished all the resources of his imagination
and Jovian hate, is the symbol and the substance of reckless adventure
and indomitable courage. (<em>Spring</em> <u>(</u><em>1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
June 1926. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1976/77.</p>
<p>Melville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The
Library of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s,
published in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to
nineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank.
Emerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf
Whittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range
PS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of
nine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in
1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea
romances like <em>Typee</em> and <em>Omoo</em>. <em>Moby-Dick</em> sold poorly when it was
published in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.</p>
<p>The critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the
publication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, <em>Herman Melville: Mariner and
Mystic</em> (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of
<em>Billy Budd</em>, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver
edited the manuscript and published it in <em>Billy Budd and Other Prose
Pieces</em> (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years
later in <em>Shorter Novels of Herman Melville</em> (Horace Liveright, 1928).</p>
<p>Weaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His
biography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated
with a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published
autobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia
University’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course
in Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this
man had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . .
and discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and
a wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, pp. 17–18).</p>
<p>Weaver wrote introductions to two editions of <em>Moby-Dick</em> that were
published as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way.
His introduction to the edition published by Albert &amp; Charles Boni in
1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the
following year for the ML.</p>
<p>The ML may have tried to position its edition of <em>Moby-Dick</em> to appeal
both to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated
the darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from
Masefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful
romance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic,
all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s
introduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the
malice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of
leperous [<em>sic</em>] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Moby Dick</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th
out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943
it was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of <em>Moby
Dick</em> from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand
following American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven
printings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of
2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling
23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of <em>Moby Dick</em>
under the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar
“specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton
House titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a
departure from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality
paper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and
were sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed
500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department
stores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do
well with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated
that they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one
of those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to
Cerf, 18 August 1932).</p>
<p>The ML also published <em>Moby Dick</em> (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series,
using plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.</p>
<p>All ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the
spelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead
of the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of
the work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of
America edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions
that omit it.</p>
<p>The Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new
typesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth
Hardwick, is inconsistent. The title is <em>Moby-Dick or, The Whale</em>, but
the biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as <em>Moby
Dick</em>, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated
form when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form
when referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983),
which includes <em>Redburn</em> and <em>White-Jacket</em> as well as <em>Moby-Dick</em>, uses
the hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages
(pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record
chapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen,
with the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp.
985–991) are MOBY DICK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br>
In the little more than one hundred years since <em>Moby Dick</em> was first
published, critics have probed its inexhaustible symbolic treasures.
The general reader has also found great wealth as he participated in
the hunt for the white whale. He encountered an adventure story of
magnificent sweep and suspense. From its incomparably effective
opening sentence, “Call me Ishmael,” to its dramatic end when the
white whale triumphs and all hands, except Ishmael, perish, Melville
makes everyone—the reader most of all—share Captain Ahab’s obsessive
belief that he alone can destroy the white, evil leviathan. <em>Moby
Dick</em> is more than a tale of the pursuit of a monster; it is an
allegory of relentless hatred and evil redeemed by man’s indomitable
courage. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Fujita pictorial jacket in deep blue (179), deep reddish
orange (36) and black on coated white paper with inset wood engraving of
whale destroying a whaling boat; lettering in deep blue, deep reddish
orange and black, all against white background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“<em>Moby Dick</em> possesses an unusual, if not unique, literary form which
cannot be compared to that of the conventional novel, drama or travel
book. It is a realistic story of life aboard a whaling vessel, a
romance of adventure and strange characters, a drama of heroic
determination and conflict and a technical treatise on whaling. . . .
Because of its unconventional complexity, it is a disturbing
book. . . . Like all great books, <em>Moby Dick</em> has the potentiality of
enriching itself with the substance of each new reader’s emotions and
ideas, and it has grown greater in its implications with the passage
of time.” —from the Introduction by Leon Howard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published with the Howard introduction in MLCE (1950) and
subsequently in the regular ML. Professor Austin Warren of the
University of Michigan was originally invited to write the introduction.
He agreed to a deadline of 30 March and a $200 fee but withdrew two days
before it was due, pleading illness and expressing dissatisfaction with
the fee compared to the royalty offered by the competing series Rinehart
Editions (Albert Erskine to Warren, 26 January 1950; Warren to Erskine,
28 March 1950). Erskine turned to Leon Howard, then at Northwestern
University, who agreed to write the introduction for the $200 fee
(Erskine to Howard, 31 March 1950).</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
In this novel—which the editors of the Modern Library consider one of
the greatest in the English language—Thomas Hardy reaches the high
water mark of his glorious genius. There are scenes in this book, and
characters, that will burn themselves into the memory of the reader,
never to be forgotten; passages of writing whose sheer beauty is
unsurpassed in all literature. “The Return of the Native” is dominated
by the tragic overtones of the Hardy conviction of inevitability—the
powerlessness of man before his fate. (<em>Spring 1926</em>)</p>

can do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper &amp; Bros., 16 May 1929).
Harper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June
(Harper &amp; Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later
that month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.</p>
<p>There are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition
to the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b
include signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates
used for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their
charm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm”
in 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good
morning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after
“good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a
reader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML
informed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.</p>

<p>There were plans in 1950 to include <em>The Return of the Native</em> in MLCE.
Albert Guerard was invited to write the introduction (ML to Guerard, 30
June 1950), but he declined on the grounds that he had just written an
introduction for the competing series Rinehart Editions. The ML then
approached Donald Davidson of Vanderbilt University, who initially
declined because of other commitments. The ML extended the deadline, and
Davidson accepted the assignment. He submitted his introduction in
spring 1951 and received the ML’s $150 fee. However, <em>The Return of the
Native</em> never appeared in MLCE, perhaps because of the competing
Rinehart edition. Davidson’s introduction does not appear to have been
used in any form.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Born with the most rudimentary kind of moral sense, Moll Flanders made
a career of harlotry, thievery and penitence. The book of her fortunes
and misfortunes, her high misdemeanors and amorous delinquencies,
remains today, as it was two hundred years ago, the liveliest and most
candid record of a bawd’s progress on the primrose path. The looseness
of Moll’s life in folly and wickedness points the moral that the wages
of sin need not be punishment and death; sometimes penitence alone
redeems the most versatile sinner. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>There was a fall 1939 printing of 127.1b after the ML’s larger format
was introduced. Not all ML titles could be switched immediately to the
new format since jacket art that was not being replaced had to be
adapted to the larger format. The two printings in spring and fall 1939
were probably small ones. The fall 1940 printing described under 127.1c
was probably the first in the Blumenthal format. Copies of the fall 1939
printing in the balloon cloth format have been seen with the remainder
stamp of a red star on the rear endpaper.</p>

wife, a thief, a convict, and finally a prosperous penitent in the
American colonies. Moll is one of the great picaresque figures in
literature, whose vitality and gusto remain undiminished by the

Born with the most rudimentary kind of moral sense, Moll Flanders made
a flamboyant life of prostitution, thievery and, finally, penitence.
This vivid saga of a beautiful, clever woman, her high misdemeanors
and delinquencies, her varied careers as a prostitute, a charming and
faithful wife, a thief and convict, remains today the liveliest, most
candid record of an eighteenth-century woman’s progress through the
hypocritical labyrinth of her society ever recorded. This book,
written by Defoe under an assumed name, so his readers would think it
an accurate journal of one woman’s life, remains a picaresque novel of
astonishing vitality.</p>

<p>The letterpress plates show serious signs of wear. Some of the page

reverted to letterpress printing for some volumes in the reissue format
(R. D. Scudellari to GBN, interview), probably to take advantage of
price breaks for using idle letterpress equipment after most book
printing had shifted to offset lithography.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1922. The B&amp;L plates were too
large for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a
new typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.
<em>WR</em> 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1
January 1940.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Up Stream</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th
out of 147 ML titles.</p>
<p>Klopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New
York, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an
introduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like
to have your name among the people who have written introductions to our
volumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had
not liked <em>Up Stream</em> but would be willing to write an introduction to a
ML edition of Lewisohn’s <em>Israel</em> (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).
In the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.</p>
<p>Lewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He
informed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral
and literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not
too extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book
in such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to
Klopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his
marriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He
removed a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote
others. In the B&amp;L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his
fourth story to <em>Uncle Remus’s Magazine</em> for $125, Lewisohn wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.
My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and
I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in
Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows
Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the
dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&amp;L, p. 135; suspension
points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&amp;L and ML
texts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.
Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor
and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was
sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be
less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions
within me. . . .</p>
<p>We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I
think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I
tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her
family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to
be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was
perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was
absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor
true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a
middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older
than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .
Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under
. . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are
the following, with the page of the 1922 Boni &amp; Liveright edition given
first, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library
printing: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;

<p>When Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of <em>Up Stream</em> she threatened
to sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:
“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor
and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked
Lewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for
including the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful
nuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will
all have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very
earliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).</p>

<p>Two changes were made in the second printing in response to Mary

passage on pp. 159–60 quoted above, and the following passage was
omitted from the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I say this in all humility and say it in order to record the fact that
the general texture of Up Stream remained free, has always been free,
of the unveracity that marked a small number of passages now changed
or expunged. Why, in my ardent search for the truth of things, did I
deliberately falsify <em>one</em> element in my life and draw falsely <em>one</em>
character? Through a mistaken kindliness? Yes. But more through
shame—shame of the all but unbelievable physical and moral
facts. . . . That blot on the book has now been wiped out. . . . If Up
Stream is still worthy of being read; if it is worthy of being
remembered—let it be read and remembered in the form in which it is
now definitively printed here. . . . (128a, p. xi)</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The original
text complete and unabridged, with a prologue by the author.” (<em>Spring
1929</em>) <em>Note:</em> The Prologue was not new to the ML edition; it had been
part of <em>Up Stream</em> since its original publication in 1922. The jacket
statement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the
introduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer
included.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative
life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. <em>Up Stream</em>
is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,
outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest
and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.
In the literature of America’s coming of age, <em>Up Stream</em> occupies a
unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final
declaration of creative independence. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the
ML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.
Lewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised <em>Up
Stream</em> for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after
those that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to
Ludwig Lewisohn in 1936 that <em>Up Stream</em> continued to sell at the rate
of 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time
that the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying
record” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).</p>
<p>Three other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. <em>A Modern Book of
Criticism</em> (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published
in spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. <em>The Story of
American Literature</em> (G43), originally published as <em>Expression in
America</em>, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to
lobby for the inclusion of his novel <em>The Island Within</em> shortly after
the Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the
series were “more than enough” but suggested that <em>Up Stream</em> might be
dropped and <em>The Island Within</em> published in its place. Lewisohn
approved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass
Canfield, Harper &amp; Bros., 12 October 1939). <em>The Island Within</em> (329)
sold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
THE AUTHOR:</p>
<p>James Joyce is the Irish novelist whose epical satire “ULYSSES” has
been hailed as the greatest product of the realistic movement in
literature.</p>
<p>THE BOOK:</p>
<p>“DUBLINERS” was written in 1905, and the author spent the next seven
years trying o make his publisher live up to a contract to bring out
the book. For the reader who has never sampled Joyce, “DUBLINERS” is
an ideal introduction. (<em>Fall 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “A book of
representative stories by the author of ‘Ulysses,’ hailed as the
greatest product of the realistic movement in literature.” (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> after the
ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s decision, sustained
afterward by the Court of Appeals, lends new importance to the Modern
Library edition of <em>Dubliners</em>. This collection of short stories is
definitely related to Joyce’s later work, in that many of its
characters figure in the epical satire, <em>Ulysses</em>, and the
autobiographical novel, <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
(Modern Library No. 145). By itself, <em>Dubliners</em> is a lasting
contribution to the literature of the short story. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in London by Grant Richards, 1914; published in
U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, using sheets of the first English edition.
First American edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting,
published by Huebsch, April 1917. Huebsch merged with Viking Press in
August 1925. ML edition (129.1, pp. [5]–288) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates. Publication announced for 25 November 1926. <em>WR</em>
1 January 1927. First printing: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Dubliners</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 84th
out of 147 ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in
April 1927 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in July 1928. By April
1950 there had been twenty-eight printings for a total of 60,000 copies

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
The collection of fifteen stories under the title of <em>Dubliners</em> was
James Joyce’s first published work in prose. Previously he had issued
a book of verse, <em>Chamber Music</em>. These initial efforts were followed
by <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> (Modern Library No. 145),
the play <em>Exiles</em>, the modern epic <em>Ulysses</em> (Modern Library Giant
G-52) and finally, <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. The tales in <em>Dubliners</em> are
related to Joyce’s later work both in locale and in many of the
characters who have a fuller development in <em>Ulysses</em>. By themselves
these tales, written by Joyce in his early twenties, are a
distinguished contribution to the literature of the short story and
are an augury of the master work which was to follow. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>

<p>Corrected text originally published by Viking Press, 1967. ML edition
(pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the
Viking edition. Published spring 1969 at $2.45.</p>
<p>The statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text
. . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the
corrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate
dialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition
published by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American
edition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American
printings before 1967—used quotation marks.</p>
<p>Printings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½
inch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in
1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼
inch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the
taller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely
redesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼
inch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch
format. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings.
The ISBN <a href="callto:+1394-6012">394-6012</a>4-6 (without the initial 0) was
added to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets
for previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is
probably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain
endpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were
characteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the
remainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front
endpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as
the 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to
understand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to
the 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger
format.</p>
<p>There appears to have been a gap of several years between the
discontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
“New Grub Street” is George Gissing’s book of the heart, a chronicle
of characters that he knew through the intimacy of suffering shared
and defeats experienced or understood. It is called back to life today
because of the insistent determination of a new age to regard Gissing
as a stylist second to none, a keen analyst of motives, and an
extraordinary literary figure whose inexplicable hardships stir the
imagination of an age surfeited with material things. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>

For those who cherish the dream of writing and for those who read and
ponder the whole mystery of the anguish and ecstasy of authorship,
<em>New Grub Street</em> is a book of revelation. Not only does it expose the
shifts and subterfuges of meagre talents to provide marketable stuff
and the devotion and sacrifice of those who consecrate themselves to
the severest of arts, but it lays bare Gissing’s own fierce struggle
against vulgarity and the world’s indifference. In that sense, it is a
true book of the heart. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>

<p>Cerf initially asked H. G. Wells to write the introduction. He told
Wells that <em>New Grub Street</em> was “long out of print in this country, and
knowing your enthusiasm for the work, I am wondering whether you will
add a short introduction for us.” He offered the ML’s usual $50 fee and
reminded Wells that <em>Ann Veronica</em> continued to sell very well in the
series (Cerf to Wells, 13 January 1926). Wells declined, but six years
later he wrote an introduction to the fine press edition of <em>The Time
Machine</em> published by Random House.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>New Grub Street</em>, one of the first exponents of Naturalism in English
literature, has been described as a cross between the works of Charles
Dickens and Thomas Hardy, and is much acclaimed for its portrait of
the unsuccessful literary life in 19th century London. It is the story
of Edward Reardon, a novelist whose valiant and painstaking attempts
to maintain the standards of his art in the face of severe financial
pressure are opposed by an unsympathetic wife. In sharp contrast to
Reardon is his friend Jasper Milvain, an essayist who adjusts himself
with shocking ease to currently materialistic ideals. A grimly
realistic look at the hardships and compromises of the modern literary
world, <em>New Grub Street</em> is an underground classic.</p>

All\nfamilies of printings of *Zuleika Dobson* in the ML, including those\nbetween 1926 and 1970 (36c‑d), are described in the chapter for 1918.\n\n### Format and printing\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm).\n\nMost ML books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of\nthe sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format, with the leaves\ntrimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 108 mm) and the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4¼\nin. (167 x 110 mm). The ML’s standard format increased in 1939 to a trim\nsize of 7 x 4⅝ in. (177 x 118 mm) with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4¾ in.\n(183 x 122 mm) and in 1969 to a taller, slightly slimmer trim size of 7¼\nx 4½ in. (183 x 115 mm) with the binding measuring 7½ x 4⅝ in. (190 x\n118 mm). Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side\nof the sheet and bound as gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956\nmost books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet\nand bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\nML books were printed by the Ferris Printing Co. in New York City during\nthe early months of 1926. Later in the year the ML switched to Parkway\nPrinting Co., 400 Lafayette St., New York City. Parkway continued to\nprint all ML books for decades to come except for a small number of\ntitles before the 1960s that were printed by offset lithography.\n\n### Title page\n\nElmer Adler, proprietor of the Pynson Press in New York, redesigned the\nML title page. He retained the basic design inherited from B&L but made\nthe title page more elegant and appealing. He replaced the B&L\ndouble-rule frame with a frame consisting of a thick outer rule and thin\ninner rule, used open-face type for the title, and eliminated the rule\n\nbetween THE MODERN LIBRARY and the last line of the title page. He also\nchanged PUBLISHERS :: :: NEW YORK to the less cluttered PUBLISHERS · NEW\nYORK and then, beginning with the third title published in 1926, to the\nmore distinctive PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK. He also enlarged Bernhard’s\ntorchbearer from 18 to 26 mm (torchbearer A2). The first version of\nAdler’s title page was used in January with Brontë’s *Wuthering\nHeights*; the latter version was introduced with Wilde’s *De Profundis*\nin April. Adler’s basic title page design remained in use through 1939\nwith changes in the imprint area in 1931 and 1936.\n\nIn general, titles from the B&L era were provided with Adler title pages\nonly when the text was reset or augmented with new content. Examples\ninclude Flaubert, *Madame Bovary* (25.2a) in 1927 and Gautier,\n*Mademoiselle de Maupin & One of Cleopatra’s Nights* (51g) in 1935.\n\n### Binding\n\nImitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine\nlettering in gold and Bernhard’s torchbearer in gold on the front cover.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nBernhard endpaper printed in light yellowish brown.\n\n### Jacket\n\nThe first two 1926 titles, Brontë, *Wuthering Heights* (120) and\nAnderson, *Poor White* (121), were published in uniform typographic\njacket B1 with no torchbearer on the front panel, “The Modern Library”\nin upper- and lowercase letters on a deep reddish orange band near the\nbottom of the front panel, and a list of ML titles on the flaps and back\npanel. All other titles added to the series in 1926 were published in\nuniform typographic jacket B2, with Bernhard’s torchbearer added to the\nfront panel above the descriptive text and “THE MODERN LIBRARY” printed\nin uppercase letters on the deep reddish orange band near the bottom of\nthe front panel.\n\nUniform typographic jacket B2 and later jackets have the following text\non the front and back flaps:\n\n> 95¢ net ($1 in Canada)\n> *On the inside of this jacket is a list, arranged alphabetically by\n> authors, of all the titles in* <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern\n> library</span>*.

His standards of\nproduction and design were the highest of any major American trade\npublisher, and he “did not in those days care to see cheap editions\npublished of our most distinguished books” (Knopf, letter to GBN, 4 May\n1977). Knopf also had other reasons for his coolness toward the ML. He\nassociated Cerf with Horace Liveright, whom he loathed; in particular he\nresented the ML edition of W. H. Hudson’s *Green Mansions* (90). It was\nKnopf’s edition of *Green Mansions*, published in 1916, that established\nthe work in the United States, but Knopf did not own the copyright.\n*Green Mansions* was in the U.S. public domain because its original\nAmerican publication by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in 1904 used imported sheets\nof the English edition. The U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 limited American\ncopyright to works that were printed and bound in the U.S.; the use of\nimported sheets cast a work irretrievably into the U.S. public domain.\nWhen Liveright added *Green Mansions* to the ML he did not pay royalties\nto Knopf. Moreover, he reprinted it with John Galsworthy’s introduction,\nwhich had been written for the Knopf edition but does not appear to have\nbeen copyrighted. Relations between Knopf and the ML remained cool until\nJanuary 1929, when a luncheon meeting organized with the help of Blanche\nKnopf led to friendly relations between the two firms.\n\n> Before 1929 Cerf appealed directly to several Knopf authors in an\n> attempt to secure their support for ML editions of their works. He wrote\n> to Joseph Hergesheimer:\n\n> It is all very well for us to advertise that our Modern Library\n> contains books by all the great modern American writers … but I am\n> extremely conscious of the fact that so long as no book of yours is on\n> the list, there is a glaring gap that we cannot explain.” He asked\n> whether “there is no way for us to have one of your books in the\n> library. I find Mr. Knopf very elusive and vague on the subject of\n> adding any volumes on which he owns the copyright to our series—a\n> condition which I very much regret, because as you know, there are\n> many other items besides your books on his list, which could be put in\n> the Modern Library, to the advantage of everybody. . . . Is there not\n> some way in which you can prevail upon Mr. Knopf to let us have one of\n> your books?\n\nCerf indicated that the ML would prefer *The Three Black Pennies* above\nall others (Cerf to Hergesheimer, 30 March 1926). Hergesheimer’s\nstanding declined in the 1930s, and Cerf did not renew his offer after\nrelations with Knopf improved.\n\nAnother Knopf author that Cerf tried to get for the ML was Arthur\nMachen. He was especially interested in Machen’s *The House of Souls*\n(Knopf, 1922) or *The Hill of Dreams* (Knopf, 1923). During a 1926 visit\nto London Cerf took Machen to lunch at Claridge’s and suggested a ML\nedition of one of the books. Machen’s American agent indicated that both\nbooks were in the U.S. public domain but that the rights situation was\ncomplicated (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 8 June 1927). Cerf indicated\nthat Machen “is anxious to see them in the Library; he is, as usual, as\nyou know, in need of money. However, I believe that we could not do\neither of these books without getting into a serious jam with Knopf, and\nI would do nothing about them unless we had his definite consent” (Cerf\nto Baumgarten, 8 June 1927). Machen also did not want to oppose Knopf in\nany way. He wrote: “My reason is that it was he who brought me out in\nyour country & did everything in his power to make me popular in\nAmerica; also that he has paid me extremely handsome fees for writing\nintroductions. . . . Therefore I should not feel happy in opposing him\nin any matter” (Machen to Cerf, 5 July 1926). None of Machen’s books\nwere reprinted in the ML, but he wrote an introduction to the ML edition\nof Smollett’s *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (179). Cerf paid him $100\nfor the introduction, twice the ML’s usual fee.\n\nOther works that Cerf considered adding to the series included\nMontesquieu’s *Persian Letters*, Frank Swinnerton’s *Nocturne*, and a\nvolume of Edmond Rostand’s plays to include *Cyrano de Bergerac*,\n*Chanticleer*, and *L’Aiglon*. He asked John Erskine to write an\nintroduction to *Persian Letters*, but the volume never appeared (Cerf\nto Erskine, 4 October 1926). Swinnerton’s literary agent declined the\noffer for *Nocturne* (Brandt & Brandt to Cerf, 16 October 1926), and the\nML ended up publishing *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174) as a separate volume\nin 1929.\n\nHorace M. Kallen suggested a volume of Bernard Shaw’s works. Shaw was\nopposed to inexpensive reprints of his plays and kept tight control of\nhis copyrights. Cerf replied, “If you can suggest how in hell’s bells we\ncan sign Shaw up for such a volume, you will immediately be elected\nPatron Saint of the Modern Library” (Cerf to Kallen, 13 October 1926).\nIt was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was\nable to publish two collections of his plays. Shaw relaxed his\nopposition to inexpensive reprints on one occasion toward the end of his\nlife. In 1946 he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of\nhis plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the\noccasion of his ninetieth birthday.\n\nHenry Hoyns of Harper & Bros. suggested W. E. Woodward’s *Bunk*, which\nHarper’s had published three years earlier (Hoyns to Cerf, 15 March\n1926). The Boston publisher Lewis C. Page, who had failed on more than\none occasion to persuade B&L to reprint Gustav Frenssen’s novel\n*Holyland*, repeated his suggestion to the ML’s new owners (Page to ML,\n17 September 1926). Page also suggested Balzac’s *Physiology of\nMarriage* for the ML. Cerf responded, “The Lord knows it is dull enough\nreading, but the title might make it a good seller, and there is just a\nchance that we will be able to make some arrangement with you for its\npublication late next year” (Cerf to Page, 16 February 1926). Page\nreplied, “You are entirely right in your analysis of the literary\nqualities and trade appeal. It is heavy reading for Modernists, but the\ntitle is alluring, and we have a steady sale” (Page to Cerf, 19 February\n1926).\n\n### Christmas gift boxes\n\nFor the 1926 Christmas season the ML packaged fifty titles in boxed sets\nof five volumes each. The ten boxed sets were sold primarily in\ndepartment stores and were intended for “that vast army of Christmas\nbook buyers who like to have their shopping made as simple as possible\nfor them” (ML ad, *PW*, 4 September 1926, pp. 803–4). Each set was\ndevoted to a particular theme and sold for $4.75, the same price as five\nvolumes purchased separately. Unlike subsequent Christmas gift boxes,\nbooks in the 1926 sets appear to have been indistinguishable from ML\nvolumes sold separately. None of the boxed sets from 1926 are known to\nhave survived. The ten sets were:\n\n1. *Masterpieces of French Romance*: Gautier, *Mademoiselle de Maupin*;\nFlaubert, *Madame Bovary*; Dumas, *Camille*; France, *The Red Lily*; and\nMaupassant, *Une Vie*.\n\n2. *Great English Novels*: Butler, *The Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *The\nReturn of the Native*; Meredith, *Diana of the Crossways*; Brontë,\n*Wuthering Heights*; and Hudson, *Green Mansions*.\n\n3. *Modern Drama*: Ibsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the\nPeopl*e; Tolstoy, *Redemption and Two Other Plays*; Schnitzler, *Anatol,\nLiving Hours, The Green Cockatoo*; O’Neill, *The Moon of the Caribbees\nand Six Other Plays of the Sea*; and Wilde, *Salomé, The Importance of\nBeing Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*.\n\n4. *Short Stories*: *Best Russian Short Stories*; Balzac, *Short\nStories*; Kipling, *Soldiers Three*; Maupassant, *Love and Other\nStories*; and *Best Ghost Stories*.\n\n5. *Leading American Authors*: Anderson, *Poor White*; Melville, *Moby\nDick*; Cabell, *Beyond Life*; Dreiser, *Free and Other Stories*; and\nJames, *Daisy Miller; An International Episode*.\n\n6. *Books of Modern Thought*: *The Philosophy of William James*;\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra*; Schopenhauer, *Studies in\nPessimism*; Ellis, *The New Spirit*; and *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*.\n\n7. *Great Modern Poetry*: Whitman, *Poems*; Swinburne, *Poems*; Dowson,\n*Poems and Prose*; Blake, *Poems*; and Wilde, *Poems*.\n\n8. *Five Great Juveniles*: Carroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,\nThrough the Looking-Glass, The Hunting of the Snark*; Van Loon, *Ancient\nMan*; *Irish Fairy and Folk Tales*, ed. Yeats; Wilde, *Fairy Tales and\nPoems in Prose*; and Stevenson, *Treasure Island*.\n\n9. *Belles Lettres*: Pater, *The Renaissance*; *The Art of Audrey\nBeardsley*; *A Modern Book of Criticism*; Moore, *Confessions of a Young\nMan*; and Pepys, *Passages from the* *Diary of Samuel Pepys*.\n\n10. *Leading English Authors of Today*: Douglas, *South Wind*;\nBeerbohm, *Zuleika Dobson*; George, *A Bed of Roses*; Lawrence, *Sons\nand Lovers*; and Shaw, *An Unsocial Socialist*.\n\nTen gift boxes to choose from may have been too many, and $4.75 may have\nbeen more than many shoppers wished to spend on a gift. The boxed sets\ncontinued to be listed in the ML’s spring–summer 1927 catalog, but there\nwere no gift boxes for the 1927 holiday season. The following year a\nsingle Christmas gift box of three ML volumes in distinctive jackets and\nbindings was offered at $2.85. Three gift boxes of three volumes each\nwere offered during the 1929 Christmas season.\n\n### New titles\n\nBrontë, *Wuthering Heights* (1926) 120 <br />\nAnderson, *Poor White* (1926) 121 <br />\nBeerbohm, *Zuleika Dobson* (1926) 36c\\* <br />\nWilde, *De Profundis* (1926) 122 <br />\nD’Annunzio, *Maidens of the Rocks* (1926) 123 <br />\nMelville, *Moby Dick* (1926) 124 <br />\nGourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926) 125 <br />\nHardy, *Return of the Native* (1926) 126 <br />\nDefoe, *Moll Flanders* (1926) 127 <br />\nLewisohn, *Up Stream* (1926) 128 <br />\nJoyce, *Dubliners* (1926) 129 <br />\nGissing, *New Grub Street* (1926) 130 <br />\n\n\\**Zuleika Dobson* (36) was published in the Boni & Liveright series in\n1918 and discontinued around the end of 1922; Cerf and Klopfer restored\nit to the ML in March 1926.

CHARLOTTE BRONTË\n\nML edition printed from duplicate plates of the edition published in\n1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. Published January 1926.\n*WR* 6 February 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1969/70. Reissued 1978.\n\nMacaulay had agreed to write an introduction to *Wuthering Heights* when\nthe ML was published by B&L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925\n(B&L advertisement, *PW*, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction\nfailed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just\nbought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited\nEngland in June but was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he\nwrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a\nshort introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s\n“Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I\nwould therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction\nwithin a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than\nfour or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of\n$50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6\nAugust 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After\nthanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your\nown books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an\nideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September\n1925).\n\nA slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included\nin the British edition of *Wuthering Heights* published in 1926 in\nJonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first\nparagraph of the introduction concludes with the following three\nsentences:\n\n> There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about\n> these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that\n> every available fact about their personalities and lives is now\n> familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at\n> all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the\n> poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to\n> his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired,\n> never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed\n> the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put\n> some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.\n\nIn the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the\nwords, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives\nis now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts\nat all.”\n\nExcept for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are\nprinted from identical plates. The only difference is that the\nTravellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the\nfirst page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other\nTravellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a\nduplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement\nmay have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.\n\nThe title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay\n(“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.\n\nBlue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay\nintroduction, for a 1939 printing of *Wuthering Heights* in its new\nreprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and\nsold for 39 cents a copy.\n\nSales of *Wuthering Heights* during the first six months of 1928 placed\nit 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter\nduring the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably\nreflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion\nof *Wuthering Heights* as one of the first titles in Modern Library\nCollege Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for\nclassroom use.\n\n#### 120.1b.

ML edition (pp. xxvii‑xxxii, \\[1\\]–400) printed from plates\noriginally made for the Illustrated Modern Library with pagination of\nthe Editor’s Preface revised. In ML and MLCE printings Charlotte\nBrontë’s Biographical Notice is reset in smaller type to match that of\nGettman’s introduction. ML and MLCE printings include Eichenberg’s\nwood-engraved chapter heads that were made for the Book-of-the-Month\nClub and the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 18) but not the full-page\nwood engravings.\n\nThe Illustrated Modern Library edition of *Wuthering Heights* (IML 18),\npublished in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition of *Wuthering\nHeights* had a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only.\nFor the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional\nwood engravings for the chapter heads. Since *Wuthering Heights*\nconsists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice\nand one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.\n\nNew plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for\nsubsequent printings of the regular ML edition. This appears to have\nbeen the intention, since the preliminaries for the regular ML edition\nof *Wuthering Heights*, including Macaulay’s introduction, were reset to\nmatch the rest of the text. However, the original plates were used when\nthe regular ML edition of *Wuthering Heights* (120.1c) was reprinted in\nfall 1947. No regular ML printings with the reset text have been seen\nprior to 120.2a, when the Illustrated Modern Library plates were used\nwith a new introduction by Royal A.

The hero works for this force\n> although he doesn’t like or understand it. He is a dreamy, rather\n> stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical\n> tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made\n> \\[*sic*\\] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s”\n> love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a\n> wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as\n> the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of\n> our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic\n> majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and\n> develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is\n> fulfilled. (*Fall 1925)*\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap: <br>\n> As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a\n> supreme position among American novelists. *Poor White*, like\n> *Winesburg, Ohio* (No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately\n> upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary\n> writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making\n> men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly\n> from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the\n> naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world\n> celebrated. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking\nPress, August 1925. ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–371) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings.\nPublished February 1926. *WR* 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued fall 1939.\n\nWhen Anderson became a B&L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed\ninterest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including\n*Poor White* in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April\n1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s\ncontract with B&L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately\nendeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in\nwriting, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library”\n(contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML\nbefore *Poor White* could be added to the series. It is not known\nwhether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or\nafter the sale.\n\nFor writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML\nbooks instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925).\nHe wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to\nbe published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to\ncall on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long\nrows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little\nlike a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city”\n(ML ed., p. vi).\n\nThe dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was\ndivorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request\n(Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication\nwas inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).\n\nSales of *Poor White* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th\nout of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies\nby April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000\ncopies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nAnderson, *Winesburg, Ohio* (1921–1973) 96\n\n### 122\n\n***OSCAR WILDE.

Other of\n> his novels in the Modern Library series are “The Flame of Life”,\n> (volume number 65), “The Child of Pleasure”, (volume number 98), and\n> “The Triumph of Death”, (volume number 112). (*Spring 1926*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Richmond & Son, 1898, and\nsubsequently by L. C. Page & Co., 1902. ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–296)\nprinted from Richmond/Page plates. Publication announced for May 1926.\n*WR* 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1928.\n\nLewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so\naggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you,\nit appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that\nare absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the\nprivilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being,\nat least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list,\nalthough some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder\nor The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box\n128, L. C. Page & Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm\ncommitment on Liveright’s part to include both *The Maidens of the\nRocks* and *The Intruder* in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the\nseries he demanded that they pay advances of $240 against royalties of 8\ncents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him\n$480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other\nthe following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10\nSeptember 1925).\n\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the\nbeginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year.\nPage responded with a pitch for *The Intruder*, noting that it was part\nof the trilogy that included *The Child of Pleasure* and *The Flame of\nLife* and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough\nstory, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers\nof the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind\nany of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always\nrun neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to\nthe two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He\nconcluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the\nother three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want\nchildren’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page\nto Cerf, 7 February 1927).\n\nCerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The\nIntruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the\nadvance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong\nfeeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library\nwith a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nD’Annunzio, *Flame of Life* (1918–1936) 62<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Triumph of Death* (1923–1931) 102<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Child of Pleasure* (1925–1931) 113\n\n### 124\n\n**HERMAN MELVILLE.

(*Spring* <u>(</u>*1939*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nJune 1926. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1976/77.\n\nMelville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The\nLibrary of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s,\npublished in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to\nnineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank.\nEmerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf\nWhittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range\nPS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of\nnine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in\n1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea\nromances like *Typee* and *Omoo*. *Moby-Dick* sold poorly when it was\npublished in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.\n\nThe critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the\npublication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, *Herman Melville: Mariner and\nMystic* (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of\n*Billy Budd*, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver\nedited the manuscript and published it in *Billy Budd and Other Prose\nPieces* (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years\nlater in *Shorter Novels of Herman Melville* (Horace Liveright, 1928).\n\nWeaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His\nbiography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated\nwith a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published\nautobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia\nUniversity’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course\nin Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this\nman had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . .\nand discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and\na wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 17–18).\n\nWeaver wrote introductions to two editions of *Moby-Dick* that were\npublished as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way.\nHis introduction to the edition published by Albert & Charles Boni in\n1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the\nfollowing year for the ML.\n\nThe ML may have tried to position its edition of *Moby-Dick* to appeal\nboth to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated\nthe darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from\nMasefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful\nromance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic,\nall the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s\nintroduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the\nmalice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of\nleperous \\[*sic*\\] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).\n\nSales of *Moby Dick* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th\nout of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943\nit was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of *Moby\nDick* from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand\nfollowing American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven\nprintings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of\n2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling\n23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).\n\nCerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of *Moby Dick*\nunder the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar\n“specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton\nHouse titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a\ndeparture from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality\npaper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and\nwere sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed\n500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department\nstores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do\nwell with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated\nthat they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nThe ML also published *Moby Dick* (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series,\nusing plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.\n\nAll ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the\nspelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead\nof the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of\nthe work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of\nAmerica edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions\nthat omit it.\n\nThe Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new\ntypesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth\nHardwick, is inconsistent. The title is *Moby-Dick or, The Whale*, but\nthe biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as *Moby\nDick*, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated\nform when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form\nwhen referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983),\nwhich includes *Redburn* and *White-Jacket* as well as *Moby-Dick*, uses\nthe hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages\n(pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record\nchapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen,\nwith the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp.\n985–991) are MOBY DICK.\n\n#### 124b.

The Modern\n> Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and\n> certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly\n> win a tremendous new audience for the book. (*Fall 1926*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.\n*WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1940.\n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th\nout of 147 ML titles.\n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New\nYork, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an\nintroduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like\nto have your name among the people who have written introductions to our\nvolumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had\nnot liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a\nML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).\nIn the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.\n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He\ninformed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral\nand literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not\ntoo extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book\nin such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to\nKlopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his\nmarriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He\nremoved a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote\nothers. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his\nfourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for $125, Lewisohn wrote:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and\n> I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in\n> Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows\n> Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the\n> dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension\n> points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML\n> texts).\n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\n> and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was\n> sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be\n> less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions\n> within me. . . .\n>\n> We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I\n> think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I\n> tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her\n> family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to\n> be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was\n> perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was\n> absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor\n> true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a\n> middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older\n> than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .\n> Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under\n> . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)\n\nA complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are\nthe following, with the page of the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition given\nfirst, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library\nprinting: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;\n146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;\n188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.\n\nWhen Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of *Up Stream* she threatened\nto sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:\n“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\nand her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked\nLewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for\nincluding the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful\nnuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will\nall have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very\nearliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).\n\n#### 128b<sub>1</sub>.

The jacket\nstatement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the\nintroduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer\nincluded.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative\n> life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. *Up Stream*\n> is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,\n> outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest\n> and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.\n> In the literature of America’s coming of age, *Up Stream* occupies a\n> unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final\n> declaration of creative independence. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nThe fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the\nML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.\nLewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised *Up\nStream* for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after\nthose that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to\nLudwig Lewisohn in 1936 that *Up Stream* continued to sell at the rate\nof 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time\nthat the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying\nrecord” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).\n\nThree other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. *A Modern Book of\nCriticism* (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published\nin spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. *The Story of\nAmerican Literature* (G43), originally published as *Expression in\nAmerica*, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to\nlobby for the inclusion of his novel *The Island Within* shortly after\nthe Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the\nseries were “more than enough” but suggested that *Up Stream* might be\ndropped and *The Island Within* published in its place. Lewisohn\napproved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass\nCanfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939). *The Island Within* (329)\nsold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewisohn, ed., *A Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75\n\nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43\n\nLewisohn, *The Island Within* (1940–1942) 329\n\n### 129\n\n***JAMES JOYCE.

ML edition\n(pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking edition. Published spring 1969 at $2.45.\n\nThe statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text\n. . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the\ncorrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate\ndialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition\npublished by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American\nedition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American\nprintings before 1967—used quotation marks.\n\nPrintings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½\ninch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in\n1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼\ninch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the\ntaller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely\nredesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼\ninch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch\nformat. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings.\nThe ISBN [394-6012](callto:+1394-6012)4-6 (without the initial 0) was\nadded to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets\nfor previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is\nprobably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain\nendpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were\ncharacteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the\nremainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front\nendpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as\nthe 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to\nunderstand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to\nthe 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger\nformat.\n\nThere appears to have been a gap of several years between the\ndiscontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.\n\n#### 129.2b.

  "titlePage": "Elmer Adler, proprietor of the Pynson Press in New York, redesigned the\nML title page. He retained the basic design inherited from B&L but made\nthe title page more elegant and appealing. He replaced the B&L\ndouble-rule frame with a frame consisting of a thick outer rule and thin\ninner rule, used open-face type for the title, and eliminated the rule\n\nbetween THE MODERN LIBRARY and the last line of the title page. He also\nchanged PUBLISHERS :: :: NEW YORK to the less cluttered PUBLISHERS · NEW\nYORK and then, beginning with the third title published in 1926, to the\nmore distinctive PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK. He also enlarged Bernhard’s\ntorchbearer from 18 to 26 mm (torchbearer A2). The first version of\nAdler’s title page was used in January with Brontë’s *Wuthering\nHeights*; the latter version was introduced with Wilde’s *De Profundis*\nin April.

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf and Klopfer tried to include several titles published by Alfred A.\nKnopf after they bought the Modern Library, but Knopf refused to allow\nany of his publications to be reprinted in the series. His standards of\nproduction and design were the highest of any major American trade\npublisher, and he “did not in those days care to see cheap editions\npublished of our most distinguished books” (Knopf, letter to GBN, 4 May\n1977). Knopf also had other reasons for his coolness toward the ML. He\nassociated Cerf with Horace Liveright, whom he loathed; in particular he\nresented the ML edition of W. H. Hudson’s *Green Mansions* (90). It was\nKnopf’s edition of *Green Mansions*, published in 1916, that established\nthe work in the United States, but Knopf did not own the copyright.\n*Green Mansions* was in the U.S. public domain because its original\nAmerican publication by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in 1904 used imported sheets\nof the English edition. The U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 limited American\ncopyright to works that were printed and bound in the U.S.; the use of\nimported sheets cast a work irretrievably into the U.S. public domain.\nWhen Liveright added *Green Mansions* to the ML he did not pay royalties\nto Knopf. Moreover, he reprinted it with John Galsworthy’s introduction,\nwhich had been written for the Knopf edition but does not appear to have\nbeen copyrighted. Relations between Knopf and the ML remained cool until\nJanuary 1929, when a luncheon meeting organized with the help of Blanche\nKnopf led to friendly relations between the two firms.\n\n> Before 1929 Cerf appealed directly to several Knopf authors in an\n> attempt to secure their support for ML editions of their works. He wrote\n> to Joseph Hergesheimer:\n\n> It is all very well for us to advertise that our Modern Library\n> contains books by all the great modern American writers … but I am\n> extremely conscious of the fact that so long as no book of yours is on\n> the list, there is a glaring gap that we cannot explain.” He asked\n> whether “there is no way for us to have one of your books in the\n> library. I find Mr. Knopf very elusive and vague on the subject of\n> adding any volumes on which he owns the copyright to our series—a\n> condition which I very much regret, because as you know, there are\n> many other items besides your books on his list, which could be put in\n> the Modern Library, to the advantage of everybody. . . . Is there not\n> some way in which you can prevail upon Mr. Knopf to let us have one of\n> your books?\n\nCerf indicated that the ML would prefer *The Three Black Pennies* above\nall others (Cerf to Hergesheimer, 30 March 1926). Hergesheimer’s\nstanding declined in the 1930s, and Cerf did not renew his offer after\nrelations with Knopf improved.\n\nAnother Knopf author that Cerf tried to get for the ML was Arthur\nMachen. He was especially interested in Machen’s *The House of Souls*\n(Knopf, 1922) or *The Hill of Dreams* (Knopf, 1923). During a 1926 visit\nto London Cerf took Machen to lunch at Claridge’s and suggested a ML\nedition of one of the books. Machen’s American agent indicated that both\nbooks were in the U.S. public domain but that the rights situation was\ncomplicated (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 8 June 1927). Cerf indicated\nthat Machen “is anxious to see them in the Library; he is, as usual, as\nyou know, in need of money. However, I believe that we could not do\neither of these books without getting into a serious jam with Knopf, and\nI would do nothing about them unless we had his definite consent” (Cerf\nto Baumgarten, 8 June 1927). Machen also did not want to oppose Knopf in\nany way. He wrote: “My reason is that it was he who brought me out in\nyour country & did everything in his power to make me popular in\nAmerica; also that he has paid me extremely handsome fees for writing\nintroductions. . . . Therefore I should not feel happy in opposing him\nin any matter” (Machen to Cerf, 5 July 1926). None of Machen’s books\nwere reprinted in the ML, but he wrote an introduction to the ML edition\nof Smollett’s *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (179). Cerf paid him $100\nfor the introduction, twice the ML’s usual fee.\n\nOther works that Cerf considered adding to the series included\nMontesquieu’s *Persian Letters*, Frank Swinnerton’s *Nocturne*, and a\nvolume of Edmond Rostand’s plays to include *Cyrano de Bergerac*,\n*Chanticleer*, and *L’Aiglon*. He asked John Erskine to write an\nintroduction to *Persian Letters*, but the volume never appeared (Cerf\nto Erskine, 4 October 1926). Swinnerton’s literary agent declined the\noffer for *Nocturne* (Brandt & Brandt to Cerf, 16 October 1926), and the\nML ended up publishing *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174) as a separate volume\nin 1929.\n\nHorace M. Kallen suggested a volume of Bernard Shaw’s works. Shaw was\nopposed to inexpensive reprints of his plays and kept tight control of\nhis copyrights. Cerf replied, “If you can suggest how in hell’s bells we\ncan sign Shaw up for such a volume, you will immediately be elected\nPatron Saint of the Modern Library” (Cerf to Kallen, 13 October 1926).\nIt was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was\nable to publish two collections of his plays. Shaw relaxed his\nopposition to inexpensive reprints on one occasion toward the end of his\nlife. In 1946 he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of\nhis plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the\noccasion of his ninetieth birthday.\n\nHenry Hoyns of Harper & Bros. suggested W. E. Woodward’s *Bunk*, which\nHarper’s had published three years earlier (Hoyns to Cerf, 15 March\n1926). The Boston publisher Lewis C. Page, who had failed on more than\none occasion to persuade B&L to reprint Gustav Frenssen’s novel\n*Holyland*, repeated his suggestion to the ML’s new owners (Page to ML,\n17 September 1926). Page also suggested Balzac’s *Physiology of\nMarriage* for the ML. Cerf responded, “The Lord knows it is dull enough\nreading, but the title might make it a good seller, and there is just a\nchance that we will be able to make some arrangement with you for its\npublication late next year” (Cerf to Page, 16 February 1926). Page\nreplied, “You are entirely right in your analysis of the literary\nqualities and trade appeal. It is heavy reading for Modernists, but the\ntitle is alluring, and we have a steady sale” (Page to Cerf, 19 February\n1926).",
  "christmasGiftBoxes": "For the 1926 Christmas season the ML packaged fifty titles in boxed sets\nof five volumes each. The ten boxed sets were sold primarily in\ndepartment stores and were intended for “that vast army of Christmas\nbook buyers who like to have their shopping made as simple as possible\nfor them” (ML ad, *PW*, 4 September 1926, pp. 803–4). Each set was\ndevoted to a particular theme and sold for $4.75, the same price as five\nvolumes purchased separately. Unlike subsequent Christmas gift boxes,\nbooks in the 1926 sets appear to have been indistinguishable from ML\nvolumes sold separately. None of the boxed sets from 1926 are known to\nhave survived. The ten sets were:\n\n1. *Masterpieces of French Romance*: Gautier, *Mademoiselle de Maupin*;\nFlaubert, *Madame Bovary*; Dumas, *Camille*; France, *The Red Lily*; and\nMaupassant, *Une Vie*.\n\n2. *Great English Novels*: Butler, *The Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *The\nReturn of the Native*; Meredith, *Diana of the Crossways*; Brontë,\n*Wuthering Heights*; and Hudson, *Green Mansions*.\n\n3. *Modern Drama*: Ibsen, *A Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the\nPeopl*e; Tolstoy, *Redemption and Two Other Plays*; Schnitzler, *Anatol,\nLiving Hours, The Green Cockatoo*; O’Neill, *The Moon of the Caribbees\nand Six Other Plays of the Sea*; and Wilde, *Salomé, The Importance of\nBeing Earnest, Lady Windermere’s Fan*.\n\n4. *Short Stories*: *Best Russian Short Stories*; Balzac, *Short\nStories*; Kipling, *Soldiers Three*; Maupassant, *Love and Other\nStories*; and *Best Ghost Stories*.\n\n5. *Leading American Authors*: Anderson, *Poor White*; Melville, *Moby\nDick*; Cabell, *Beyond Life*; Dreiser, *Free and Other Stories*; and\nJames, *Daisy Miller; An International Episode*.\n\n6. *Books of Modern Thought*: *The Philosophy of William James*;\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra*; Schopenhauer, *Studies in\nPessimism*; Ellis, *The New Spirit*; and *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*.\n\n7. *Great Modern Poetry*: Whitman, *Poems*; Swinburne, *Poems*; Dowson,\n*Poems and Prose*; Blake, *Poems*; and Wilde, *Poems*.\n\n8. *Five Great Juveniles*: Carroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,\nThrough the Looking-Glass, The Hunting of the Snark*; Van Loon, *Ancient\nMan*; *Irish Fairy and Folk Tales*, ed.

The boxed sets\ncontinued to be listed in the ML’s spring–summer 1927 catalog, but there\nwere no gift boxes for the 1927 holiday season. The following year a\nsingle Christmas gift box of three ML volumes in distinctive jackets and\nbindings was offered at $2.85. Three gift boxes of three volumes each\nwere offered during the 1929 Christmas season.",

CHARLOTTE BRONTË\n\nML edition printed from duplicate plates of the edition published in\n1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. Published January 1926.\n*WR* 6 February 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1969/70. Reissued 1978.\n\nMacaulay had agreed to write an introduction to *Wuthering Heights* when\nthe ML was published by B&L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925\n(B&L advertisement, *PW*, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction\nfailed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just\nbought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited\nEngland in June but was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he\nwrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a\nshort introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s\n“Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I\nwould therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction\nwithin a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than\nfour or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of\n$50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6\nAugust 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After\nthanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your\nown books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an\nideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September\n1925).\n\nA slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included\nin the British edition of *Wuthering Heights* published in 1926 in\nJonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first\nparagraph of the introduction concludes with the following three\nsentences:\n\n> There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about\n> these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that\n> every available fact about their personalities and lives is now\n> familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at\n> all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the\n> poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to\n> his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired,\n> never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed\n> the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put\n> some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.\n\nIn the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the\nwords, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives\nis now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts\nat all.”\n\nExcept for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are\nprinted from identical plates. The only difference is that the\nTravellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the\nfirst page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other\nTravellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a\nduplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement\nmay have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.\n\nThe title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay\n(“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.\n\nBlue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay\nintroduction, for a 1939 printing of *Wuthering Heights* in its new\nreprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and\nsold for 39 cents a copy.\n\nSales of *Wuthering Heights* during the first six months of 1928 placed\nit 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter\nduring the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably\nreflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion\nof *Wuthering Heights* as one of the first titles in Modern Library\nCollege Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for\nclassroom use.\n\n#### 120.1b.

ML edition (pp. xxvii‑xxxii, \\[1\\]–400) printed from plates\noriginally made for the Illustrated Modern Library with pagination of\nthe Editor’s Preface revised. In ML and MLCE printings Charlotte\nBrontë’s Biographical Notice is reset in smaller type to match that of\nGettman’s introduction. ML and MLCE printings include Eichenberg’s\nwood-engraved chapter heads that were made for the Book-of-the-Month\nClub and the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 18) but not the full-page\nwood engravings.\n\nThe Illustrated Modern Library edition of *Wuthering Heights* (IML 18),\npublished in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition of *Wuthering\nHeights* had a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only.\nFor the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional\nwood engravings for the chapter heads. Since *Wuthering Heights*\nconsists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice\nand one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.\n\nNew plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for\nsubsequent printings of the regular ML edition.

(*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking\nPress, August 1925. ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–371) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings.\nPublished February 1926. *WR* 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued fall 1939.\n\nWhen Anderson became a B&L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed\ninterest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including\n*Poor White* in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April\n1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s\ncontract with B&L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately\nendeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in\nwriting, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library”\n(contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML\nbefore *Poor White* could be added to the series. It is not known\nwhether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or\nafter the sale.\n\nFor writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML\nbooks instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925).\nHe wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to\nbe published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to\ncall on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long\nrows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little\nlike a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city”\n(ML ed., p. vi).\n\nThe dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was\ndivorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request\n(Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication\nwas inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).\n\nSales of *Poor White* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th\nout of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies\nby April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000\ncopies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nAnderson, *Winesburg, Ohio* (1921–1973) 96"

Publication announced for May 1926.\n*WR* 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1928.\n\nLewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so\naggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you,\nit appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that\nare absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the\nprivilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being,\nat least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list,\nalthough some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder\nor The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box\n128, L. C. Page & Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm\ncommitment on Liveright’s part to include both *The Maidens of the\nRocks* and *The Intruder* in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the\nseries he demanded that they pay advances of $240 against royalties of 8\ncents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him\n$480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other\nthe following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10\nSeptember 1925).\n\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the\nbeginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year.\nPage responded with a pitch for *The Intruder*, noting that it was part\nof the trilogy that included *The Child of Pleasure* and *The Flame of\nLife* and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough\nstory, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers\nof the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind\nany of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always\nrun neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to\nthe two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He\nconcluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the\nother three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want\nchildren’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page\nto Cerf, 7 February 1927).\n\nCerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The\nIntruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the\nadvance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong\nfeeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library\nwith a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nD’Annunzio, *Flame of Life* (1918–1936) 62<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Triumph of Death* (1923–1931) 102<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Child of Pleasure* (1925–1931) 113"

Discontinued\n1976/77.\n\nMelville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The\nLibrary of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s,\npublished in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to\nnineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank.\nEmerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf\nWhittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range\nPS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of\nnine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in\n1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea\nromances like *Typee* and *Omoo*. *Moby-Dick* sold poorly when it was\npublished in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.\n\nThe critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the\npublication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, *Herman Melville: Mariner and\nMystic* (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of\n*Billy Budd*, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver\nedited the manuscript and published it in *Billy Budd and Other Prose\nPieces* (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years\nlater in *Shorter Novels of Herman Melville* (Horace Liveright, 1928).\n\nWeaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His\nbiography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated\nwith a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published\nautobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia\nUniversity’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course\nin Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this\nman had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . .\nand discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and\na wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 17–18).\n\nWeaver wrote introductions to two editions of *Moby-Dick* that were\npublished as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way.\nHis introduction to the edition published by Albert & Charles Boni in\n1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the\nfollowing year for the ML.\n\nThe ML may have tried to position its edition of *Moby-Dick* to appeal\nboth to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated\nthe darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from\nMasefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful\nromance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic,\nall the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s\nintroduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the\nmalice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of\nleperous \\[*sic*\\] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).\n\nSales of *Moby Dick* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th\nout of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943\nit was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of *Moby\nDick* from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand\nfollowing American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven\nprintings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of\n2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling\n23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).\n\nCerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of *Moby Dick*\nunder the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar\n“specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton\nHouse titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a\ndeparture from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality\npaper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and\nwere sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed\n500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department\nstores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do\nwell with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated\nthat they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nThe ML also published *Moby Dick* (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series,\nusing plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.\n\nAll ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the\nspelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead\nof the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of\nthe work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of\nAmerica edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions\nthat omit it.\n\nThe Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new\ntypesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth\nHardwick, is inconsistent. The title is *Moby-Dick or, The Whale*, but\nthe biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as *Moby\nDick*, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated\nform when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form\nwhen referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983),\nwhich includes *Redburn* and *White-Jacket* as well as *Moby-Dick*, uses\nthe hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages\n(pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record\nchapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen,\nwith the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp.\n985–991) are MOBY DICK.\n\n#### 124b.

The color and charm of the book and the\n> continuous beauty of its prose established it immediately as an\n> important and permanent contribution to American letters. The Modern\n> Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and\n> certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly\n> win a tremendous new audience for the book. (*Fall 1926*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.\n*WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1940.\n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th\nout of 147 ML titles.\n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New\nYork, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an\nintroduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like\nto have your name among the people who have written introductions to our\nvolumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had\nnot liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a\nML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).\nIn the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.\n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He\ninformed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral\nand literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not\ntoo extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book\nin such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to\nKlopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his\nmarriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He\nremoved a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote\nothers. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his\nfourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for $125, Lewisohn wrote:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and\n> I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in\n> Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows\n> Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the\n> dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension\n> points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML\n> texts).\n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\n> and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was\n> sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be\n> less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions\n> within me. . . .\n>\n> We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I\n> think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I\n> tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her\n> family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to\n> be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was\n> perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was\n> absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor\n> true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a\n> middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older\n> than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .\n> Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under\n> . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)\n\nA complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are\nthe following, with the page of the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition given\nfirst, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library\nprinting: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;\n146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;\n188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.\n\nWhen Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of *Up Stream* she threatened\nto sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:\n“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\nand her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked\nLewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for\nincluding the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful\nnuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will\nall have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very\nearliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).\n\n#### 128b<sub>1</sub>.

The jacket\nstatement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the\nintroduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer\nincluded.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative\n> life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. *Up Stream*\n> is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,\n> outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest\n> and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.\n> In the literature of America’s coming of age, *Up Stream* occupies a\n> unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final\n> declaration of creative independence. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nThe fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the\nML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.\nLewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised *Up\nStream* for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after\nthose that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to\nLudwig Lewisohn in 1936 that *Up Stream* continued to sell at the rate\nof 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time\nthat the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying\nrecord” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).\n\nThree other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. *A Modern Book of\nCriticism* (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published\nin spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. *The Story of\nAmerican Literature* (G43), originally published as *Expression in\nAmerica*, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to\nlobby for the inclusion of his novel *The Island Within* shortly after\nthe Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the\nseries were “more than enough” but suggested that *Up Stream* might be\ndropped and *The Island Within* published in its place. Lewisohn\napproved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass\nCanfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939). *The Island Within* (329)\nsold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewisohn, ed., *A Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75\n\nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43\n\nLewisohn, *The Island Within* (1940–1942) 329"

Previously he had issued\n> a book of verse, *Chamber Music*. These initial efforts were followed\n> by *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (Modern Library No. 145),\n> the play *Exiles*, the modern epic *Ulysses* (Modern Library Giant\n> G-52) and finally, *Finnegans Wake*. The tales in *Dubliners* are\n> related to Joyce’s later work both in locale and in many of the\n> characters who have a fuller development in *Ulysses*. By themselves\n> these tales, written by Joyce in his early twenties, are a\n> distinguished contribution to the literature of the short story and\n> are an augury of the master work which was to follow.

ML edition\n(pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking edition. Published spring 1969 at $2.45.\n\nThe statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text\n. . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the\ncorrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate\ndialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition\npublished by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American\nedition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American\nprintings before 1967—used quotation marks.\n\nPrintings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½\ninch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in\n1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼\ninch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the\ntaller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely\nredesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼\ninch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch\nformat. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings.\nThe ISBN [394-6012](callto:+1394-6012)4-6 (without the initial 0) was\nadded to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets\nfor previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is\nprobably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain\nendpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were\ncharacteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the\nremainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front\nendpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as\nthe 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to\nunderstand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to\nthe 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger\nformat.\n\nThere appears to have been a gap of several years between the\ndiscontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.\n\n#### 129.2b.

Brewster, 1904, using sheets of\nthe second British edition. ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting. Published December 1926. *WR* 25 December 1926. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1943; new ML edition\npublished 1985.\n\nCerf initially asked H. G. Wells to write the introduction. He told\nWells that *New Grub Street* was “long out of print in this country, and\nknowing your enthusiasm for the work, I am wondering whether you will\nadd a short introduction for us.” He offered the ML’s usual $50 fee and\nreminded Wells that *Ann Veronica* continued to sell very well in the\nseries (Cerf to Wells, 13 January 1926). Wells declined, but six years\nlater he wrote an introduction to the fine press edition of *The Time\nMachine* published by Random House.\n\nSales of *New Grub Street* during the first six months of 1928 placed it\n91st out of 147 ML titles.\n\nCoustillas (pp. 565–69) provides a detailed inventory of variant\nbindings and other details of successive ML printings.\n\n#### 130.1b.
