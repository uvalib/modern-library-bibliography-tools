<h2>Fall 1925</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The Modern Library series was founded in May 1917 by Boni &amp; Liveright,
a new publishing firm that was created to publish the Modern Library.
The series was conceived by Albert Boni, a twenty-five year old
Greenwich Village bookseller and occasional publisher. The Modern
Library was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an
intense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural
upheaval. His Washington Square Bookshop was a favorite gathering
place for Village artists and intellectuals. He was one of the
founders of the Washington Square Players. As publisher of The Glebe,
a little magazine edited by Alfred Kreymborg, he was already active in
promoting translations of modern European writers—much to the dismay
of Kreymborg, who was interested mainly in discovering and nurturing
unknown Americans.</p>
<p>In May 1925, less than two years after joining Boni &amp; Liveright as
vice-president president, Bennett A. Cerf negotiated an agreement to
buy the Modern Library from Horace Liveright. He had dreamed of having
his own firm from the time he entered publishing, and Liveright, as
usual, needed money. The firm had not had a best seller since 1923,
Liveright was losing money in the stock market, he was beginning to
moonlight as a Broadway producer, and he wanted a divorce. As part of
the separation agreement he had to repay large sums that he had
borrowed from his wife and father-in-law. Tom Dardis, Liveright’s
latest biographer, indicates that the debts to his wife and
father-in-law had been repaid at this point and speculates that his
primary reason for selling the Modern Library was “the huge amounts he
required to continue producing plays on Broadway” (Dardis, Firebrand:
The Life of Horace Liveright, p. 228).</p>
<p>In his unpublished autobiography, written shortly before his death,
Liveright indicates that the meeting at which the sale of the Modern
Library was agreed to was preceded by several weeks of conversations and
meetings with friends and advisers and with Cerf and his advisers
(Autobiography, insert y, p. 2. Komroff Papers, Columbia University
Library). Cerf recalls the decision as having been proposed and settled
on May 19. Liveright, who took Cerf to a farewell luncheon to celebrate
Cerf’s departure that evening for his first trip to Europe, complained
about financial pressures. Cerf repeated an offer he had made before to
buy the Modern Library. This time, instead of brushing him off,
Liveright asked what he would pay for it, and they continued to
negotiate at the office that afternoon. By the end of the afternoon a
deal had been struck (Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, pp. 44–46).</p>
<p>Cerf and Liveright agreed to a selling price of $200,000. Included in
that sum was the $25,000 that Cerf had lent Liveright when he joined the
firm and an additional $25,000 he lent him subsequently. Cerf was
getting the Modern Library for an additional payment of $150,000. The
money was due after Cerf’s return from Europe, with Cerf to assume
control of the series on August 1st.</p>
<p>That evening Cerf sailed on the <em>Aquitania</em> for his first trip to
Europe. That night he wrote in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so I’m off for bed after the most eventful day of my life. I
bought the Modern Library from Boni &amp; Liveright after a whirlwind
conference—a step that will alter my entire career (Cerf, Diary, 20
May 1925, Bennet Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday on his last full day at sea
before arriving at Southampton on May 26th.</p>
<p>Many details of the purchase remained to be settled. Cerf’s plans called
for Donald S. Klopfer to put up $100,000 and go in with him as equal
partner, but Klopfer was not certain at the time Cerf sailed that he
would be able to raise the money. The two men had met during the autumn
of 1918 at Columbia University, when Cerf was a senior and Klopfer was a
freshman. Klopfer transferred to Williams College in the middle of his
freshman year, but he and Cerf remained friends. Cerf recalled in his
autobiography that after attending a concert at Carnegie Hall they
walked “all the way around Central Park – over to Fifth Avenue up to
110th Street, over to Central Park West and down to 59th Street, just
talking. And when we finished that walk, we were friends for life”
(Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, pp. 24–25).</p>
<p>Klopfer left college after his sophomore year to work for his
stepfather, who held a one-sixth interest in United Diamond Works, a
diamond cutting and polishing factory in Newark, New Jersey. His
stepfather had since died, leaving Klopfer his interest in the closely
held firm. The other owners agreed to buy Klopfer’s interest for 80
percent of the book value, giving him the $100,000 he needed (Klopfer,
interview with GBN, 5 July 1978), and he had the money by the time Cerf
returned from Europe.</p>
<p>That gave Cerf and Klopfer enough money to buy the Modern Library, but
they lacked working capital to meet operating expenses. At this point
Cerf’s uncle, Herbert Wise, came to their aid, lending them 500 shares
of Norfolk and Western railroad stock, which was then selling for about
$130 a share. They used the stock as collateral for a $50,000 bank loan.
They returned the stock to Wise a hundred shares at a time and were able
to pay off the entire loan within two years.</p>
<p>One final hitch came up before the sale of the Modern Library was
completed. At the last minute Liveright insisted that Cerf and Klopfer
give him a contract as an adviser for five years at five thousand
dollars a year. “His advice was the last thing we needed,” Cerf
recalled, “but he said if we didn’t agree to it, the deal was off. So we
had to give in” (Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, p. 54). Shortly after they took over
the series they offered Liveright a lump payment of fifteen thousand
dollars to cancel the agreement, and Liveright accepted. So the total
cost of the Modern Library came to $215,000.</p>
<p>Ownership of the Modern Library was transferred to Cerf and Klopfer on 1
August 1925. They acquired the name and good will of the series, reprint
rights to copyrighted titles included in it, the plates owned by Boni &amp;
Liveright, and the stock of books on hand, most of which were unbound.
The value of the plates and books was estimated at $75,000 (Columbia
Auditors, C.P.A. to Henry Hoyns, Harper and Bros., 22 July 1925).</p>
<p>The new company was incorporated as The Modern Library, Inc., with Cerf
as President and Klopfer as Vice-President. Gustave Cerf (Cerf’s
father), who worked on a part-time basis until his death in 1941, was
listed as Secretary and Treasurer. They were joined by two Boni &amp;
Liveright employees: Emanuel Harper, who soon became the firm’s
treasurer, and Helen Berlin, who was Cerf and Klopfer’s secretary from
1925 until 1928. The Modern Library, Inc. opened for business in a
two-room office on the ninth floor of 71 West 45th Street. Cerf and
Klopfer worked at desks facing each other. After moving to larger
quarters they continued to share an office and work at facing desks
until Klopfer accepted a commission in the Air Force in May 1942. They
shared a secretary until Cerf’s death in 1971.</p>
<p>The sale of the Modern Library was announced in the <em>New York Times</em> on
13 July 1925. The following advertisement appeared in <em>Publishers’
Weekly</em> (1 August 1925, p. 423; italics in original):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>News!</p>
<p>THE MODERN LIBRARY HAS CHANGED HANDS!</p>
<p>ON AUGUST FIRST, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, a new organization
will assume publication and distribution of the MODERN LIBRARY.</p>
<p>Its name will be the MODERN LIBRARY, Incorporated.</p>
<p>Its address will be 71 West 45th Street, New York City.</p>
<p>Its sole endeavor will be the further development and exploitation of
a series that has grown in eight years to embrace 110 titles, and to
be known wherever English books are read.</p>
<p>The format and general character of THE MODERN LIBRARY books will be
absolutely unchanged.</p>
<p>The American bookseller can count on the generous cooperation of an
experienced and strongly fortified organization with <em>no general
publications over which to concern itself</em>, devoting its entire
energies to one project – the growth of the MODERN LIBRARY.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding
measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼
in. (164 x 107 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Boni &amp; Liveright printings</h3>
<p>A large portion of the ML stock that Cerf and Klopfer acquired from B&amp;L
consisted of folded and sewn sheets with Brodzky endpapers attached to
the outer leaves. These were sold in ML, Inc. imitation leather bindings
and newly printed ML, Inc. jackets. This hybrid format, with B&amp;L title
pages and endpapers and ML, Inc. bindings and jackets, is common for
final B&amp;L printings. Bound and jacketed volumes acquired from B&amp;L were
sold as they were; a small number of bound B&amp;L titles were provided with
newly printed ML, Inc. jackets.</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>New titles added to the ML in fall 1925 used the title page design
inherited from B&amp;L with torchbearer A1 (designed by Lucian Bernhard)
replacing the B&amp;L monk device. The title page is enclosed in double
rules with each section (title, author, author of the introduction,
device, publisher, and place of publication) separated by a horizontal
rule. Most B&amp;L titles that were reprinted between fall 1925 and 1939
continued to use existing title-page plates with the B&amp;L device replaced
by torchbearer A1. In general, new title-page plates were made for B&amp;L
titles only when the text was reset or augmented with new content.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Imitation leather in dark green or brown with spine lettering in gold
and Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front panel. The bindings were
identical to those used by B&amp;L except for the use of the torchbearer
device in place of the B&amp;L device</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>The Brodzky endpaper inherited from B&amp;L was used on the first printing
of Beebe’s <em>Jungle Peace</em> (116) and the earliest ML, Inc. reprints of
some B&amp;L titles. Bernhard’s new endpaper incorporating his torchbearer
design, printed in light yellowish brown, was used on all subsequent
titles and later printings of <em>Jungle Peace</em>.</p>
<h3>Jacket</h3>
<p>Uniform typographic jacket is patterned after late B&amp;L jackets. The
Bernhard torchbearer replaces the B&amp;L device on the spine but does not
appear on the front panel. Fall 1925 jackets indicate the title and
author in capital letters on a deep reddish orange band near the top of
the front panel and the series (“The Modern Library” in upper- and
lowercase letters) on a deep reddish orange band near the bottom. The
jackets include a complete list of ML titles on the flaps and back
panel. Both jacket flaps include the publisher’s name and address: the
Modern Library, Inc., 71 West 45th St., New York. Some fall 1925 jackets
have the statement “New title added monthly” at the bottom of the front
flap instead of the publisher’s name and address.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating key</h3>
<p>(Fall) Dumas, <em>Camille</em> xAnderson, <em>Poor White</em>.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Theodore Dreiser was one of the first authors Cerf contacted after
buying the ML. Cerf expressed the hope that <em>Free and Other Stories</em>
(106) would remain in the series for many years to come and that Dreiser
would allow the ML to include one of his novels “on a basis that I am
sure could be made satisfactory to both of us” (Cerf to Dreiser, 25 July
1925). <em>Twelve Men</em> (159) was added in 1928 and <em>Sister Carrie</em> (230)
followed in 1932. <em>An American Tragedy</em> (G89), which B&amp;L published in
fall 1925 shortly after Cerf and Klopfer took over the ML, was reprinted
as a ML Giant in 1956.</p>
<p>Willa Cather and Edna St. Vincent Millay were among the first authors
that Cerf tried to secure for the ML. He wanted Cather’s <em>Song of the
Lark</em> and a volume of plays by Millay, but the original publishers
declined to grant reprint rights. <em>The Song of the Lark</em> sold too well
for Houghton Mifflin to consider a ML edition (Robert N. Linscott,
Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 4 September 1925). Cerf offered Appleton a
five-year reprint contract with royalties of 8 cents a copy for Millay’s
plays “Two Slatterns and a King,” “Aria da Capo,” and “The Lamp and the
Bell”, indicating that he wanted to use Appleton plates for a first ML
printing of 3,000 copies. Millay’s publisher flatly rejected the offer
(John W. Hiltman, Appleton &amp; Co., to Cerf, 14 October 1925).</p>
<p>After meeting Walter de la Mare during his trip to England in the summer
of 1925, Cerf wrote to enlist his support for a ML edition of one of his
works: “I am particularly anxious to have a Walter de La [<em>sic</em>] Mare
title in the library and am writing direct to you because before I
proceed to interview any of the American publishers who hold the
copyright to your works, I would like to hear from you which one of your
books, in your opinion, would fit best in the series” (Cerf to de la
Mare, 16 October 1925). De la Mare replied that the decision must be
left to his American publishers but indicated that he had asked his
agent, James B. Pinker, to take up the matter with them (de la Mare to
Cerf, 19 November 1925). Several weeks later Pinker told Cerf that none
of de la Mare’s American publishers were willing to authorize a reprint
edition (James B. Pinker &amp; Sons to Cerf, 14 December 1925).</p>
<p>Cerf contacted H. L. Mencken in 1926 about adding his <em>Philosophy of
Friedrich Nietzsche</em> to the series, but Mencken replied that it was
outmoded and in need of revision (Cerf to Mencken, 14 December 1925;
Mencken to Cerf, 22 December 1925). Originally published in 1908,
Mencken’s study was the first book on Nietzsche in English (Hobson,
Fred. <em>Mencken: A Life</em>, p. 89). It has been widely reprinted since it
entered the public domain, including several reprint editions in the
first decade of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The New York publisher Charles Renard offered to sell the ML its plates
for J. M. Barrie’s <em>The Little Minister</em>. Cerf replied that the ML would
“have no possible use for the plates . . . for some time to come” but
offered $50 for them (Charles Renard Co. to Cerf, 18 November 1925; Cerf
to Renard Co., 30 November 1925). He later increased the offer to $200,
but this appears to have been much less than Renard wanted.</p>
<h3>Discontinued</h3>
<p>Blasco Ibáñez, <em>The Cabin</em> (1920) 73</p>
<p>Stephens, <em>Mary, Mary</em> (1917) 26</p>
<p>Only a few hundred copies of <em>Mary, Mary</em> (26) and <em>The Cabin</em> (73)
remained in the B&amp;L warehouse when Cerf and Klopfer took over the
series. They promptly discontinued them and reassigned their catalogue
numbers, ML 30 and 69, to Beebe, <em>Jungle Peace</em> and Dumas, <em>Camille</em>,
the first new titles added in fall 1925.</p>

As a trained scientific observer, William Beebe has conducted many

a record unique among books of exploration. In <em>Jungle Peace</em> he
describes a remote and glamorous segment of the world —Guiana — and
creates a picture of tropical splendor and mystery. He tells of birds

the wonder of a born story-teller. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>Written by Dumas when he was twenty-five, CAMILLE remains in its
combination of freshness and form and of the feeling of the springtime
of life, a singular, an astonishing piece of work. The novel and the
play have been blown about the world at a fearful rate, but the story
has never lost its happy juvenility, a charm that nothing can
vulgarize. It is all champagne and tears – fresh perversity, fresh
credulity, fresh passion, fresh pain. We have seen the play both well
done and ill done – in strange places, in barbarous tongues. But
nothing makes any difference – it carries with it an April air: some
tender young man and some coughing young woman have only to speak the
lines to give it a great place among the love-stories of the world.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
New generations of readers respond as their parents and grandparents
did with unashamed tears to the sad plight of the beautiful and doomed
Marguerite Gautier. <em>Camille</em> retains its fragrance through the years;
it is a tale that stirs an unassuageable heartache, and over it there
hovers a sentiment forever tender and yearning. It is read now as it
was before and as it will be read years hence as the love story of the
eternal Magdalene glorified by her passion and misfortune. (<em>Spring

<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>If the band of genial and optimistic dramatic critics who have been
hailing every twenty-two year old lyricist who negotiates a rhyme with
more than one syllable in it as “another Gilbert come to town” ever
sees this volume, they’ll simply lock themselves in their room! For a
rereading of PINAFORE, PATIENCE, THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD and
RUDDIGORE, all of them contained in this one volume, will convince
them anew that there is only one Gilbert, and that, futhermore
[<em>sic</em>], his myriad of imitators fade into utter nothingness beside
the brilliance and undying sparkle of his famous songs and ballads.</p>
<p>Another Modern Library volume (number 26) contains THE MIKADO, THE
PIRATES OF PENZANCE, IOLANTHE, and THE GONDOLIERS. The two volumes
belong in the library of every dramatic critic, musical comedy author,
and tired business man in America. (<em>Fall 1925</em>)</p>

If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan enthusiast (and who is not?), here,

Sullivan’s inspired tunes. All the sprightliness, the gay satire and
the felicity of rhyme are yours for the reading! This is one of the
two volumes of W. S. Gilbert’s plays in the Modern Library; the other
(No. 26) contains <em>The Mikado</em>, <em>The Gondoliers</em>, <em>The Pirates of
Penzance</em> and <em>Iolanthe</em>. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>What William James thinks about man, and the world, and man’s place in
it, he has said in many books and many scattered papers. These do not
present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and
intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and
living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he
aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died
before the book was half done.</p>
<p>The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view
of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his
own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to
that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to
complete his work. (<em>Fall 1925</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The world recognizes that William James stands pre-eminent among the
philosophers of America. His writings have had an influence that has
reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the
social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence
of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always
the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and
forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His
is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (<em>Fall
1934</em>)</p>

<p>Kallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on
<em>The Philosophy of William James</em>. His royalties during the first six
months of 1926 totaled $179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions
fees to James’s original publishers. A few days after <em>The Philosophy of
William James</em> was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar
volume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined.
The ML published <em>Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell</em> (147) in October
1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial
work appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926
Kallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was
interested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the
project three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which
published most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary
permissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection,
<em>The Philosophy of Santayana</em>, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942
(see 355).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Philosophy of William James</em> during the first six months
of 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period
May 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.</p>

The Modern\nLibrary was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an\nintense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural\nupheaval. His Washington Square Bookshop was a favorite gathering\nplace for Village artists and intellectuals. He was one of the\nfounders of the Washington Square Players. As publisher of The Glebe,\na little magazine edited by Alfred Kreymborg, he was already active in\npromoting translations of modern European writers—much to the dismay\nof Kreymborg, who was interested mainly in discovering and nurturing\nunknown Americans.\n\nIn May 1925, less than two years after joining Boni & Liveright as\nvice-president president, Bennett A. Cerf negotiated an agreement to\nbuy the Modern Library from Horace Liveright. He had dreamed of having\nhis own firm from the time he entered publishing, and Liveright, as\nusual, needed money. The firm had not had a best seller since 1923,\nLiveright was losing money in the stock market, he was beginning to\nmoonlight as a Broadway producer, and he wanted a divorce. As part of\nthe separation agreement he had to repay large sums that he had\nborrowed from his wife and father-in-law. Tom Dardis, Liveright’s\nlatest biographer, indicates that the debts to his wife and\nfather-in-law had been repaid at this point and speculates that his\nprimary reason for selling the Modern Library was “the huge amounts he\nrequired to continue producing plays on Broadway” (Dardis, Firebrand:\nThe Life of Horace Liveright, p. 228).\n\nIn his unpublished autobiography, written shortly before his death,\nLiveright indicates that the meeting at which the sale of the Modern\nLibrary was agreed to was preceded by several weeks of conversations and\nmeetings with friends and advisers and with Cerf and his advisers\n(Autobiography, insert y, p. 2. Komroff Papers, Columbia University\nLibrary). Cerf recalls the decision as having been proposed and settled\non May 19. Liveright, who took Cerf to a farewell luncheon to celebrate\nCerf’s departure that evening for his first trip to Europe, complained\nabout financial pressures. Cerf repeated an offer he had made before to\nbuy the Modern Library. This time, instead of brushing him off,\nLiveright asked what he would pay for it, and they continued to\nnegotiate at the office that afternoon. By the end of the afternoon a\ndeal had been struck (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 44–46).\n\nCerf and Liveright agreed to a selling price of $200,000. Included in\nthat sum was the $25,000 that Cerf had lent Liveright when he joined the\nfirm and an additional $25,000 he lent him subsequently. Cerf was\ngetting the Modern Library for an additional payment of $150,000. The\nmoney was due after Cerf’s return from Europe, with Cerf to assume\ncontrol of the series on August 1st.\n\nThat evening Cerf sailed on the *Aquitania* for his first trip to\nEurope. That night he wrote in his diary:\n\n> And so I’m off for bed after the most eventful day of my life. I\n> bought the Modern Library from Boni & Liveright after a whirlwind\n> conference—a step that will alter my entire career (Cerf, Diary, 20\n> May 1925, Bennet Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library).\n\nHe celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday on his last full day at sea\nbefore arriving at Southampton on May 26th.\n\nMany details of the purchase remained to be settled. Cerf’s plans called\nfor Donald S. Klopfer to put up $100,000 and go in with him as equal\npartner, but Klopfer was not certain at the time Cerf sailed that he\nwould be able to raise the money. The two men had met during the autumn\nof 1918 at Columbia University, when Cerf was a senior and Klopfer was a\nfreshman. Klopfer transferred to Williams College in the middle of his\nfreshman year, but he and Cerf remained friends. Cerf recalled in his\nautobiography that after attending a concert at Carnegie Hall they\nwalked “all the way around Central Park – over to Fifth Avenue up to\n110th Street, over to Central Park West and down to 59th Street, just\ntalking. And when we finished that walk, we were friends for life”\n(Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 24–25).\n\nKlopfer left college after his sophomore year to work for his\nstepfather, who held a one-sixth interest in United Diamond Works, a\ndiamond cutting and polishing factory in Newark, New Jersey. His\nstepfather had since died, leaving Klopfer his interest in the closely\nheld firm. The other owners agreed to buy Klopfer’s interest for 80\npercent of the book value, giving him the $100,000 he needed (Klopfer,\ninterview with GBN, 5 July 1978), and he had the money by the time Cerf\nreturned from Europe.\n\nThat gave Cerf and Klopfer enough money to buy the Modern Library, but\nthey lacked working capital to meet operating expenses. At this point\nCerf’s uncle, Herbert Wise, came to their aid, lending them 500 shares\nof Norfolk and Western railroad stock, which was then selling for about\n$130 a share. They used the stock as collateral for a $50,000 bank loan.\nThey returned the stock to Wise a hundred shares at a time and were able\nto pay off the entire loan within two years.\n\nOne final hitch came up before the sale of the Modern Library was\ncompleted. At the last minute Liveright insisted that Cerf and Klopfer\ngive him a contract as an adviser for five years at five thousand\ndollars a year. “His advice was the last thing we needed,” Cerf\nrecalled, “but he said if we didn’t agree to it, the deal was off. So we\nhad to give in” (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 54). Shortly after they took over\nthe series they offered Liveright a lump payment of fifteen thousand\ndollars to cancel the agreement, and Liveright accepted. So the total\ncost of the Modern Library came to $215,000.\n\nOwnership of the Modern Library was transferred to Cerf and Klopfer on 1\nAugust 1925. They acquired the name and good will of the series, reprint\nrights to copyrighted titles included in it, the plates owned by Boni &\nLiveright, and the stock of books on hand, most of which were unbound.\nThe value of the plates and books was estimated at $75,000 (Columbia\nAuditors, C.P.A. to Henry Hoyns, Harper and Bros., 22 July 1925).\n\nThe new company was incorporated as The Modern Library, Inc., with Cerf\nas President and Klopfer as Vice-President. Gustave Cerf (Cerf’s\nfather), who worked on a part-time basis until his death in 1941, was\nlisted as Secretary and Treasurer. They were joined by two Boni &\nLiveright employees: Emanuel Harper, who soon became the firm’s\ntreasurer, and Helen Berlin, who was Cerf and Klopfer’s secretary from\n1925 until 1928. The Modern Library, Inc. opened for business in a\ntwo-room office on the ninth floor of 71 West 45th Street. Cerf and\nKlopfer worked at desks facing each other. After moving to larger\nquarters they continued to share an office and work at facing desks\nuntil Klopfer accepted a commission in the Air Force in May 1942. They\nshared a secretary until Cerf’s death in 1971.\n\nThe sale of the Modern Library was announced in the *New York Times* on\n13 July 1925. The following advertisement appeared in *Publishers’\nWeekly* (1 August 1925, p. 423; italics in original):\n\n> News!\n>\n> THE MODERN LIBRARY HAS CHANGED HANDS!\n>\n> ON AUGUST FIRST, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, a new organization\n> will assume publication and distribution of the MODERN LIBRARY.\n>\n> Its name will be the MODERN LIBRARY, Incorporated.\n>\n> Its address will be 71 West 45th Street, New York City.\n>\n> Its sole endeavor will be the further development and exploitation of\n> a series that has grown in eight years to embrace 110 titles, and to\n> be known wherever English books are read.\n>\n> The format and general character of THE MODERN LIBRARY books will be\n> absolutely unchanged.\n>\n> The American bookseller can count on the generous cooperation of an\n> experienced and strongly fortified organization with *no general\n> publications over which to concern itself*, devoting its entire\n> energies to one project – the growth of the MODERN LIBRARY.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Boni & Liveright printings\n\nA large portion of the ML stock that Cerf and Klopfer acquired from B&L\nconsisted of folded and sewn sheets with Brodzky endpapers attached to\nthe outer leaves. These were sold in ML, Inc. imitation leather bindings\nand newly printed ML, Inc. jackets. This hybrid format, with B&L title\npages and endpapers and ML, Inc. bindings and jackets, is common for\nfinal B&L printings. Bound and jacketed volumes acquired from B&L were\nsold as they were; a small number of bound B&L titles were provided with\nnewly printed ML, Inc. jackets.\n\n### Title page\n\nNew titles added to the ML in fall 1925 used the title page design\ninherited from B&L with torchbearer A1 (designed by Lucian Bernhard)\nreplacing the B&L monk device. The title page is enclosed in double\nrules with each section (title, author, author of the introduction,\ndevice, publisher, and place of publication) separated by a horizontal\nrule. Most B&L titles that were reprinted between fall 1925 and 1939\ncontinued to use existing title-page plates with the B&L device replaced\nby torchbearer A1. In general, new title-page plates were made for B&L\ntitles only when the text was reset or augmented with new content.\n\n### Binding\n\nImitation leather in dark green or brown with spine lettering in gold\nand Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front panel. The bindings were\nidentical to those used by B&L except for the use of the torchbearer\ndevice in place of the B&L device\n\n### Endpaper\n\nThe Brodzky endpaper inherited from B&L was used on the first printing\nof Beebe’s *Jungle Peace* (116) and the earliest ML, Inc. reprints of\nsome B&L titles. Bernhard’s new endpaper incorporating his torchbearer\ndesign, printed in light yellowish brown, was used on all subsequent\ntitles and later printings of *Jungle Peace*.\n\n### Jacket\n\nUniform typographic jacket is patterned after late B&L jackets. The\nBernhard torchbearer replaces the B&L device on the spine but does not\nappear on the front panel. Fall 1925 jackets indicate the title and\nauthor in capital letters on a deep reddish orange band near the top of\nthe front panel and the series (“The Modern Library” in upper- and\nlowercase letters) on a deep reddish orange band near the bottom. The\njackets include a complete list of ML titles on the flaps and back\npanel. Both jacket flaps include the publisher’s name and address: the\nModern Library, Inc., 71 West 45th St., New York. Some fall 1925 jackets\nhave the statement “New title added monthly” at the bottom of the front\nflap instead of the publisher’s name and address.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating key\n\n(Fall) Dumas, *Camille* xAnderson, *Poor White*.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nTheodore Dreiser was one of the first authors Cerf contacted after\nbuying the ML. Cerf expressed the hope that *Free and Other Stories*\n(106) would remain in the series for many years to come and that Dreiser\nwould allow the ML to include one of his novels “on a basis that I am\nsure could be made satisfactory to both of us” (Cerf to Dreiser, 25 July\n1925). *Twelve Men* (159) was added in 1928 and *Sister Carrie* (230)\nfollowed in 1932. *An American Tragedy* (G89), which B&L published in\nfall 1925 shortly after Cerf and Klopfer took over the ML, was reprinted\nas a ML Giant in 1956.\n\nWilla Cather and Edna St. Vincent Millay were among the first authors\nthat Cerf tried to secure for the ML. He wanted Cather’s *Song of the\nLark* and a volume of plays by Millay, but the original publishers\ndeclined to grant reprint rights. *The Song of the Lark* sold too well\nfor Houghton Mifflin to consider a ML edition (Robert N. Linscott,\nHoughton Mifflin, to Cerf, 4 September 1925). Cerf offered Appleton a\nfive-year reprint contract with royalties of 8 cents a copy for Millay’s\nplays “Two Slatterns and a King,” “Aria da Capo,” and “The Lamp and the\nBell”, indicating that he wanted to use Appleton plates for a first ML\nprinting of 3,000 copies. Millay’s publisher flatly rejected the offer\n(John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., to Cerf, 14 October 1925).\n\nAfter meeting Walter de la Mare during his trip to England in the summer\nof 1925, Cerf wrote to enlist his support for a ML edition of one of his\nworks: “I am particularly anxious to have a Walter de La \\[*sic*\\] Mare\ntitle in the library and am writing direct to you because before I\nproceed to interview any of the American publishers who hold the\ncopyright to your works, I would like to hear from you which one of your\nbooks, in your opinion, would fit best in the series” (Cerf to de la\nMare, 16 October 1925). De la Mare replied that the decision must be\nleft to his American publishers but indicated that he had asked his\nagent, James B. Pinker, to take up the matter with them (de la Mare to\nCerf, 19 November 1925). Several weeks later Pinker told Cerf that none\nof de la Mare’s American publishers were willing to authorize a reprint\nedition (James B. Pinker & Sons to Cerf, 14 December 1925).\n\nCerf contacted H. L. Mencken in 1926 about adding his *Philosophy of\nFriedrich Nietzsche* to the series, but Mencken replied that it was\noutmoded and in need of revision (Cerf to Mencken, 14 December 1925;\nMencken to Cerf, 22 December 1925). Originally published in 1908,\nMencken’s study was the first book on Nietzsche in English (Hobson,\nFred. *Mencken: A Life*, p. 89). It has been widely reprinted since it\nentered the public domain, including several reprint editions in the\nfirst decade of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe New York publisher Charles Renard offered to sell the ML its plates\nfor J. M. Barrie’s *The Little Minister*. Cerf replied that the ML would\n“have no possible use for the plates . . . for some time to come” but\noffered $50 for them (Charles Renard Co. to Cerf, 18 November 1925; Cerf\nto Renard Co., 30 November 1925). He later increased the offer to $200,\nbut this appears to have been much less than Renard wanted.\n\n### Discontinued\n\nBlasco Ibáñez, *The Cabin* (1920) 73\n\nStephens, *Mary, Mary* (1917) 26\n\nOnly a few hundred copies of *Mary, Mary* (26) and *The Cabin* (73)\nremained in the B&L warehouse when Cerf and Klopfer took over the\nseries. They promptly discontinued them and reassigned their catalogue\nnumbers, ML 30 and 69, to Beebe, *Jungle Peace* and Dumas, *Camille*,\nthe first new titles added in fall 1925.\n\n### 116\n\n***WILLIAM BEEBE.

Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nKallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on\n*The Philosophy of William James*. His royalties during the first six\nmonths of 1926 totaled $179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions\nfees to James’s original publishers. A few days after *The Philosophy of\nWilliam James* was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar\nvolume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined.\nThe ML published *Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell* (147) in October\n1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial\nwork appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926\nKallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was\ninterested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the\nproject three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which\npublished most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary\npermissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection,\n*The Philosophy of Santayana*, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942\n(see 355).\n\nSales of *The Philosophy of William James* during the first six months\nof 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period\nMay 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.\n\n#### 119b.

The Modern\nLibrary was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an\nintense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural\nupheaval. His Washington Square Bookshop was a favorite gathering\nplace for Village artists and intellectuals. He was one of the\nfounders of the Washington Square Players. As publisher of The Glebe,\na little magazine edited by Alfred Kreymborg, he was already active in\npromoting translations of modern European writers—much to the dismay\nof Kreymborg, who was interested mainly in discovering and nurturing\nunknown Americans.\n\nIn May 1925, less than two years after joining Boni & Liveright as\nvice-president president, Bennett A. Cerf negotiated an agreement to\nbuy the Modern Library from Horace Liveright. He had dreamed of having\nhis own firm from the time he entered publishing, and Liveright, as\nusual, needed money. The firm had not had a best seller since 1923,\nLiveright was losing money in the stock market, he was beginning to\nmoonlight as a Broadway producer, and he wanted a divorce. As part of\nthe separation agreement he had to repay large sums that he had\nborrowed from his wife and father-in-law. Tom Dardis, Liveright’s\nlatest biographer, indicates that the debts to his wife and\nfather-in-law had been repaid at this point and speculates that his\nprimary reason for selling the Modern Library was “the huge amounts he\nrequired to continue producing plays on Broadway” (Dardis, Firebrand:\nThe Life of Horace Liveright, p. 228).\n\nIn his unpublished autobiography, written shortly before his death,\nLiveright indicates that the meeting at which the sale of the Modern\nLibrary was agreed to was preceded by several weeks of conversations and\nmeetings with friends and advisers and with Cerf and his advisers\n(Autobiography, insert y, p. 2. Komroff Papers, Columbia University\nLibrary). Cerf recalls the decision as having been proposed and settled\non May 19. Liveright, who took Cerf to a farewell luncheon to celebrate\nCerf’s departure that evening for his first trip to Europe, complained\nabout financial pressures. Cerf repeated an offer he had made before to\nbuy the Modern Library. This time, instead of brushing him off,\nLiveright asked what he would pay for it, and they continued to\nnegotiate at the office that afternoon. By the end of the afternoon a\ndeal had been struck (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 44–46).\n\nCerf and Liveright agreed to a selling price of $200,000. Included in\nthat sum was the $25,000 that Cerf had lent Liveright when he joined the\nfirm and an additional $25,000 he lent him subsequently. Cerf was\ngetting the Modern Library for an additional payment of $150,000. The\nmoney was due after Cerf’s return from Europe, with Cerf to assume\ncontrol of the series on August 1st.\n\nThat evening Cerf sailed on the *Aquitania* for his first trip to\nEurope. That night he wrote in his diary:\n\n> And so I’m off for bed after the most eventful day of my life. I\n> bought the Modern Library from Boni & Liveright after a whirlwind\n> conference—a step that will alter my entire career (Cerf, Diary, 20\n> May 1925, Bennet Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library).\n\nHe celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday on his last full day at sea\nbefore arriving at Southampton on May 26th.\n\nMany details of the purchase remained to be settled. Cerf’s plans called\nfor Donald S. Klopfer to put up $100,000 and go in with him as equal\npartner, but Klopfer was not certain at the time Cerf sailed that he\nwould be able to raise the money. The two men had met during the autumn\nof 1918 at Columbia University, when Cerf was a senior and Klopfer was a\nfreshman. Klopfer transferred to Williams College in the middle of his\nfreshman year, but he and Cerf remained friends. Cerf recalled in his\nautobiography that after attending a concert at Carnegie Hall they\nwalked “all the way around Central Park – over to Fifth Avenue up to\n110th Street, over to Central Park West and down to 59th Street, just\ntalking. And when we finished that walk, we were friends for life”\n(Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 24–25).\n\nKlopfer left college after his sophomore year to work for his\nstepfather, who held a one-sixth interest in United Diamond Works, a\ndiamond cutting and polishing factory in Newark, New Jersey. His\nstepfather had since died, leaving Klopfer his interest in the closely\nheld firm. The other owners agreed to buy Klopfer’s interest for 80\npercent of the book value, giving him the $100,000 he needed (Klopfer,\ninterview with GBN, 5 July 1978), and he had the money by the time Cerf\nreturned from Europe.\n\nThat gave Cerf and Klopfer enough money to buy the Modern Library, but\nthey lacked working capital to meet operating expenses. At this point\nCerf’s uncle, Herbert Wise, came to their aid, lending them 500 shares\nof Norfolk and Western railroad stock, which was then selling for about\n$130 a share. They used the stock as collateral for a $50,000 bank loan.\nThey returned the stock to Wise a hundred shares at a time and were able\nto pay off the entire loan within two years.\n\nOne final hitch came up before the sale of the Modern Library was\ncompleted. At the last minute Liveright insisted that Cerf and Klopfer\ngive him a contract as an adviser for five years at five thousand\ndollars a year. “His advice was the last thing we needed,” Cerf\nrecalled, “but he said if we didn’t agree to it, the deal was off. So we\nhad to give in” (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 54). Shortly after they took over\nthe series they offered Liveright a lump payment of fifteen thousand\ndollars to cancel the agreement, and Liveright accepted. So the total\ncost of the Modern Library came to $215,000.\n\nOwnership of the Modern Library was transferred to Cerf and Klopfer on 1\nAugust 1925. They acquired the name and good will of the series, reprint\nrights to copyrighted titles included in it, the plates owned by Boni &\nLiveright, and the stock of books on hand, most of which were unbound.\nThe value of the plates and books was estimated at $75,000 (Columbia\nAuditors, C.P.A. to Henry Hoyns, Harper and Bros., 22 July 1925).\n\nThe new company was incorporated as The Modern Library, Inc., with Cerf\nas President and Klopfer as Vice-President. Gustave Cerf (Cerf’s\nfather), who worked on a part-time basis until his death in 1941, was\nlisted as Secretary and Treasurer. They were joined by two Boni &\nLiveright employees: Emanuel Harper, who soon became the firm’s\ntreasurer, and Helen Berlin, who was Cerf and Klopfer’s secretary from\n1925 until 1928. The Modern Library, Inc. opened for business in a\ntwo-room office on the ninth floor of 71 West 45th Street. Cerf and\nKlopfer worked at desks facing each other. After moving to larger\nquarters they continued to share an office and work at facing desks\nuntil Klopfer accepted a commission in the Air Force in May 1942. They\nshared a secretary until Cerf’s death in 1971.\n\nThe sale of the Modern Library was announced in the *New York Times* on\n13 July 1925. The following advertisement appeared in *Publishers’\nWeekly* (1 August 1925, p. 423; italics in original):\n\n> News!\n>\n> THE MODERN LIBRARY HAS CHANGED HANDS!\n>\n> ON AUGUST FIRST, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, a new organization\n> will assume publication and distribution of the MODERN LIBRARY.\n>\n> Its name will be the MODERN LIBRARY, Incorporated.\n>\n> Its address will be 71 West 45th Street, New York City.\n>\n> Its sole endeavor will be the further development and exploitation of\n> a series that has grown in eight years to embrace 110 titles, and to\n> be known wherever English books are read.\n>\n> The format and general character of THE MODERN LIBRARY books will be\n> absolutely unchanged.\n>\n> The American bookseller can count on the generous cooperation of an\n> experienced and strongly fortified organization with *no general\n> publications over which to concern itself*, devoting its entire\n> energies to one project – the growth of the MODERN LIBRARY.",
  "format": "All new titles were published in the standard format, with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin.

In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).",

This hybrid format, with B&L title\npages and endpapers and ML, Inc. bindings and jackets, is common for\nfinal B&L printings.

Most B&L titles that were reprinted between fall 1925 and 1939\ncontinued to use existing title-page plates with the B&L device replaced\nby torchbearer A1. In general, new title-page plates were made for B&L\ntitles only when the text was reset or augmented with new content.",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Theodore Dreiser was one of the first authors Cerf contacted after\nbuying the ML. Cerf expressed the hope that *Free and Other Stories*\n(106) would remain in the series for many years to come and that Dreiser\nwould allow the ML to include one of his novels “on a basis that I am\nsure could be made satisfactory to both of us” (Cerf to Dreiser, 25 July\n1925). *Twelve Men* (159) was added in 1928 and *Sister Carrie* (230)\nfollowed in 1932. *An American Tragedy* (G89), which B&L published in\nfall 1925 shortly after Cerf and Klopfer took over the ML, was reprinted\nas a ML Giant in 1956.\n\nWilla Cather and Edna St. Vincent Millay were among the first authors\nthat Cerf tried to secure for the ML. He wanted Cather’s *Song of the\nLark* and a volume of plays by Millay, but the original publishers\ndeclined to grant reprint rights. *The Song of the Lark* sold too well\nfor Houghton Mifflin to consider a ML edition (Robert N. Linscott,\nHoughton Mifflin, to Cerf, 4 September 1925). Cerf offered Appleton a\nfive-year reprint contract with royalties of 8 cents a copy for Millay’s\nplays “Two Slatterns and a King,” “Aria da Capo,” and “The Lamp and the\nBell”, indicating that he wanted to use Appleton plates for a first ML\nprinting of 3,000 copies. Millay’s publisher flatly rejected the offer\n(John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., to Cerf, 14 October 1925).\n\nAfter meeting Walter de la Mare during his trip to England in the summer\nof 1925, Cerf wrote to enlist his support for a ML edition of one of his\nworks: “I am particularly anxious to have a Walter de La \\[*sic*\\] Mare\ntitle in the library and am writing direct to you because before I\nproceed to interview any of the American publishers who hold the\ncopyright to your works, I would like to hear from you which one of your\nbooks, in your opinion, would fit best in the series” (Cerf to de la\nMare, 16 October 1925). De la Mare replied that the decision must be\nleft to his American publishers but indicated that he had asked his\nagent, James B. Pinker, to take up the matter with them (de la Mare to\nCerf, 19 November 1925). Several weeks later Pinker told Cerf that none\nof de la Mare’s American publishers were willing to authorize a reprint\nedition (James B. Pinker & Sons to Cerf, 14 December 1925).\n\nCerf contacted H. L. Mencken in 1926 about adding his *Philosophy of\nFriedrich Nietzsche* to the series, but Mencken replied that it was\noutmoded and in need of revision (Cerf to Mencken, 14 December 1925;\nMencken to Cerf, 22 December 1925). Originally published in 1908,\nMencken’s study was the first book on Nietzsche in English (Hobson,\nFred. *Mencken: A Life*, p. 89). It has been widely reprinted since it\nentered the public domain, including several reprint editions in the\nfirst decade of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe New York publisher Charles Renard offered to sell the ML its plates\nfor J. M. Barrie’s *The Little Minister*. Cerf replied that the ML would\n“have no possible use for the plates . . . for some time to come” but\noffered $50 for them (Charles Renard Co. to Cerf, 18 November 1925; Cerf\nto Renard Co., 30 November 1925). He later increased the offer to $200,\nbut this appears to have been much less than Renard wanted.",

These do not\n> present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and\n> intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and\n> living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he\n> aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died\n> before the book was half done.\n>\n> The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view\n> of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his\n> own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to\n> that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to\n> complete his work. (*Fall 1925*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)\n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform philosophy jacket in moderate green (145) and black\non cream paper. Signed: WC.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The world recognizes that William James stands pre-eminent among the\n> philosophers of America. His writings have had an influence that has\n> reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the\n> social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence\n> of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always\n> the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and\n> forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His\n> is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (*Fall\n> 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published December 1925. *WR* 19 December 1925.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nKallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on\n*The Philosophy of William James*. His royalties during the first six\nmonths of 1926 totaled $179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions\nfees to James’s original publishers. A few days after *The Philosophy of\nWilliam James* was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar\nvolume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined.\nThe ML published *Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell* (147) in October\n1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial\nwork appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926\nKallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was\ninterested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the\nproject three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which\npublished most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary\npermissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection,\n*The Philosophy of Santayana*, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942\n(see 355).\n\nSales of *The Philosophy of William James* during the first six months\nof 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period\nMay 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.\n\n#### 119b.
