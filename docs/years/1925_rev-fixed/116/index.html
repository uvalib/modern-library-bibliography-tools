It is not merely a ‘book of the season’ or ‘book of the year’; it will stand on the shelves of cultivated people, of people whose taste in reading is both wide and good, as long as men and women appreciate charm of form in the writings of men who also combine love of daring adventure with the power to observe and vividly to record the things of strange interest which they have seen. . . . If I had space I would like to give an abstract of the whole book. As it is I merely advise all who love good books, very good books, at once to get this book of Mr. Beebe’s.”  THEODORE ROOSEVELT (Fall 1925)"

He tells of birds and beasts, plants and insects with the accuracy of the scientist and the wonder of a born story-teller. (Spring 1934)"
