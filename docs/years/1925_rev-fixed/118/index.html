    "If the band of genial and optimistic dramatic critics who have been hailing every twenty-two year old lyricist who negotiates a rhyme with more than one syllable in it as “another Gilbert come to town” ever sees this volume, they’ll simply lock themselves in their room! For a rereading of PINAFORE, PATIENCE, THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD and RUDDIGORE, all of them contained in this one volume, will convince them anew that there is only one Gilbert, and that, futhermore [sic], his myriad of imitators fade into utter nothingness beside the brilliance and undying sparkle of his famous songs and ballads.",
    "Another Modern Library volume (number 26) contains THE MIKADO, THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE, IOLANTHE, and THE GONDOLIERS. The two volumes belong in the library of every dramatic critic, musical comedy author, and tired business man in America. (Fall 1925)",

    "If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan enthusiast (and who is not?), here, for your constant delight, are four W. S. Gilbert librettos—those merry, spoofing plays to which you have sung and whistled Sir Arthur Sullivan’s inspired tunes. All the sprightliness, the gay satire and the felicity of rhyme are yours for the reading! This is one of the two volumes of W. S. Gilbert’s plays in the Modern Library; the other (No. 26) containsThe Mikado,The Gondoliers,The Pirates ofPenzanceandIolanthe. (Fall 1933)",
