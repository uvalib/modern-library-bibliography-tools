    "Written by Dumas when he was twenty-five, CAMILLE remains in its combination of freshness and form and of the feeling of the springtime of life, a singular, an astonishing piece of work. The novel and the play have been blown about the world at a fearful rate, but the story has never lost its happy juvenility, a charm that nothing can vulgarize. It is all champagne and tears – fresh perversity, fresh credulity, fresh passion, fresh pain. We have seen the play both well done and ill done – in strange places, in barbarous tongues. But nothing makes any difference – it carries with it an April air: some tender young man and some coughing young woman have only to speak the lines to give it a great place among the love-stories of the world. HENRY JAMES (Spring 1928)",
    "JacketB:Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front abridged from Henry James quotation on jacket A: “A novel and play that have been blown about the world—but nothing can alter it. It is all champagne and tears—fresh passion, fresh pain—one of the great love stories of the world.”  Henry James (Fall 1930)",
    "Front flap:",
    "New generations of readers respond as their parents and grandparents did with unashamed tears to the sad plight of the beautiful and doomed Marguerite Gautier.Camilleretains its fragrance through the years; it is a tale that stirs an unassuageable heartache, and over it there hovers a sentiment forever tender and yearning. It is read now as it was before and as it will be read years hence as the love story of the eternal Magdalene glorified by her passion and misfortune. (Spring 1934)",
    "JacketC:Pictorial in strong yellowish pink (26), pale blue (185) and black on coated cream paper depicting a woman seated in an open coach driven by a bearded coachman; title in strong yellowish pink with three-dimensional shading in black, other lettering in black.

    "Gosse was editor-in-chief of the French Classical Romances series. His introduction and biographical note are taken from the Appleton edition, where the ML introduction constitutes the last third (pp. xxiii–xxxii) of his longer critical essay, “The Novels of Alexandre Dumas the Younger.” The ML paid Appleton a permissions fee of $25 for their use.
