<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1943</h1>
<h2>1943</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>By 1943 the impact of gasoline rationing and other wartime restrictions
had reduced the ways in which people could spend leisure time away from
home. They turned in large numbers to reading as an alternative. Demand
for books was such that almost anything publishers brought out was
snatched-up. Few publishers had ever encountered such demand for books
and the experience was dazzling. But it also had drawbacks. “When you
are able to sell any junk that you can get between covers,” Cerf
commented, “it takes the kick out of putting over the really good
numbers” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943). Between 1942
and 1943, sales of ML books increased from $339,902 to $596,454.</p>
<p>The war brought not only increased demand for books in general but also
shifts in demand for certain types of books. Books dealing with the war
itself were popular. But there also seems to have been increased demand
for books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry
and philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a
disproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong
among men in the service.</p>
<p>The Modern Library’s most notable new venture in the 1940s was a series
called the Illustrated Modern Library. It was launched in 1943 in the
midst of the war. Each volume contained specially commissioned
illustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell,
Salvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz
Kredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes
were one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in
individually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943
in time for the Christmas season. Fourteen additional titles were issued
between 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library
initially sold for $1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war
forced the discontinuation of the series.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Seven titles were added to the series and three were discontinued,
bringing the total number of titles in the list to 231.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Titles published in 1943 were 7¼ x 4⅞ inch page size with individually
designed title pages. Many of the title pages were designed by Joseph
Blumenthal, who set them at his Spiral Press and made electrotype plates
for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printers. The binding, also
designed by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth
linen. Blumenthal’s binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or
dark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped
in gold. Kent’s torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on
the spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were
bordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside
each panel.</p>
<p>The bindings were red, blue, green, or gray. Unlike the balloon cloth
bindings used from 1929 through spring 1939, each printing of a given
title was available in only one color.</p>
<p>Rockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a
central panel of 1¾ by 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer,
surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the
torchbearers; for the rest of the endpapers, there were torchbearers on
the paste-down and free endpapers facing each other, light brownish gray
(63); endpapers in medium orange (53).</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents### Dating keys</p>
<p>(Spring) Du Maurier, <em>Rebecca</em> xShakespeare; Giants through G62;
jackets: 291. (Fall) Shakespeare xJefferson, <em>Life and Selected
Writings</em>; Giants through G63; jackets: 292.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>McKeon had an idea for a collection entitled <em>Medieval Philosophers</em>.
Cerf asked Hoyns for reprint rights to Fosdick’s <em>On Being a Real
Person</em>, saying it was “one of the finest books that has been published
in the past ten years,” and offering a $5,000 advance (Cerf to Hoyns, 12
November 1943).</p>
<p>Hoyns suggested Silone’s <em>The Seed Beneath the Snow</em> and Algren’s <em>Never
Come Morning</em> for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 20 May 1943).</p>
<p>Cerf declined to add an Elizabeth Bowen novel, noting “I don’t think
that there will be a sufficient demand for any of Elizabeth Bowen’s
novels to justify such an addition to the Modern Library series” (Cerf
to Brown, 20 July 1943).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The three books which have provided spiritual solace for centuries are
here brought together in a single volume for a time when the entire
world is seeking comfort against the tragic impact of war. Here for
sustenance in a moment of trial are: Boethius, the sixth-century Roman
statesman who offers the consolatory gifts of philosophy; Thomas à
Kempis, fifteenth-century German mystic whose book of simple
devotional meditations has been an inspiration to Christians of all
denominations; Sir Thomas Browne the seventeenth-century English
physician whose faith was as sympathetic as it was imaginative.
(<em>Spring 1943</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published February 1943. <em>WR</em> 13 March 1943.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple
Classics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of <em>The
Imitation of Christ</em> is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M.
Dent, 1910). The text of <em>Religio Medici</em> probably derives from <em>The
Religio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne</em> (Everyman’s
Library, 1906).</p>
<p>Edman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for
his work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000
words that would include discussions of the three individual works. When
it arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind
of introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the
Modern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).</p>
<p>Cerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of
Boetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of
Chicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical
Library was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new
one (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).</p>
<p>J. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland,
noted that <em>Religio Medici</em> was on the Index and warned that its
inclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised
using a different translation of <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>. “If you
could use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a
Protestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this
would make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio
Medici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November
1942).</p>
<p>Eckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his
opinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the
fact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough
literate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point
of view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral
viewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman
to Commins, 11 November 1942).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943.</p>

For sheer entertainment, there are few romances comparable to Daphne
du Maurier’s <em>Rebecca</em>. Written with a deep intensity of emotion, it
carries the reader headlong in its current to its final dramatic
climax. The spirit of the dead mistress of Manderley hovers over the
story, dominating the living until, in the end, her sinister spell is
broken forever. As a novel, <em>Rebecca</em> won the immediate favor of the
reading public and maintained a leading place on the best-seller lists
for several seasons. On the screen, it shattered all existing records
for popularity and won almost every award which can be given to a
motion picture. (<em>Spring 1943</em>)</p>

made from a different typesetting.</p>
<p>The Doubleday plates that the ML was using by the early 1950s appear to
have been made primarily for the use of publishers of inexpensive
hardbound reprints. In addition to the ML they were used by Doubleday’s
Sun Dial Press, Blakiston Co., Book League of America, and International
Collector’s Library. The 360.2 plates reduced the length of the book by
100 pages by using smaller type and squeezing forty lines of text (five
more than 360.1) to the page, thus significantly reducing printing
costs. Both sets of plates used by the ML had been designed for
full-sized books and in the ML’s compact format produced a type page
with uncomfortably narrow margins.</p>

<p>Cerf wrote in his foreword:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The compilation of a volume of Great Modern Stories for the Modern
Library was originally entrusted to the late Grant Overton in 1930.
This amiable gentleman brought around his list in due course, but was
far too good-natured and too gentle to hold out against the demands of
Donald Klopfer and myself. The eleven stories that were finally
included represented our own idea of a happy compromise: two of them
were Overton’s choice and nine of them were ours. Now Grant’s
remaining two have been scrapped, along with two of our own, and five
new ones substituted. I wish that Grant were here to forgive me. He
would say again, I know, “It’s your Library, boys; you know what you
want to put into it!”</p>
<p>Of the twelve stories in this new edition, my favorite four are “Heart
of Darkness,” “The Apple-Tree,” “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” and “The
Red Pony,” but the other eight are not far behind them. Anybody with a
pastepot and scissors can—and does—perpetrate anthologies today, but
I’d like to see anybody compile one that tops this collection in
quality! It has variety, balance, color and distinction. (pp.

<p>Commins was pleased with the introduction except for a passage in which
Lerner stated: “If we compare it with Plato’s <em>Republic</em>, it is not a
brilliantly written book. It mixes the great with the trivial; long
stretches of it seem only pedantic categorizing; other stretches seem
rather obvious. The whole is poorly proportioned and badly joined.
Between the oases of insight there are desert wastes of pedestrian
analysis.” Commins feared that the passage would discourage prospective
readers (Commins to Lerner, 25 November 1942); Lerner agreed and it was
omitted.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
By the test of time alone, Edith Wharton’s <em>Age of Innocence</em> has more
than justified the enthusiastic adjectives applied to it when it was
first published more than twenty years ago [±first published and
acclaimed in 1920]. Then it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for
Literature, and ever since has been winning new favor in the eyes of
judges of enduring American fiction. This story of New York before it
became of age captures the spirit of the metropolis and preserves for
us the social history of an era, in the decade of the 1870’s, when
elegance and gallantry were on display on gas-lit Fifth Avenue.

<p>Originally published by D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1920. ML edition (363.1, pp.
[<em>7</em>], 1–[365] printed from Appleton-Century plates. Published March
1943. <em>WR</em> 13 March 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1971/72.</p>
<p>The merger between D. Appleton &amp; Co. and the Century Co. took place in
1933, ten years before the ML edition was published.</p>
<p>The first ML printing includes all the textual variants noted by
Garrison (pp. 230–31) as having been incorporated in the third, fourth,
fifth, tenth, and twenty-first Appleton printings except p. 26, line 25,
where a semi-colon rather than a comma follows “gone out.” The
semi-colon is retained in the 1953 John Lehmann printing, from which the
1967 ML edition (363.2) is reproduced, and in the Library of America
edition of <em>The Age of Innocence</em> and three other Wharton novels (1985).</p>
<p>Grosset &amp; Dunlap printings from Appleton plates were available in the
1920s and 1930s, first in Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s Popular Copyright Series
and subsequently in its Novels of Distinction series (Garrison, p. 235).</p>
<p>There was a second ML printing of 1,500 copies in July 1943.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 4,168 copies by 1 November 1943. Garrison (p. 236)
cites a letter that refers to a projected first ML printing of 7,500
copies; given the timing of the second printing and the sales achieved
by November 1943 a first printing of 5,000 copies appears more likely.</p>

the 2-line Lehmann imprint is replaced by torchbearer J and the ML

<p>Wyndham’s Introductory Note (Lehmann ed., pp. 5–6) is omitted from the
ML edition despite the retention of the title-page statement “With an

[5–6] of 363.2 is reset and slightly revised from 363.1.</p>
<p>The ML’s reprint contract was terminated in 1968, possibly because of a
reprint edition published that year by Charles Scribner’s Sons. It was
estimated that the 6,700 copies of the ML edition then in stock would
last about three years.</p>

The most ambitious project ever undertaken by the Modern Library is
the publication of the complete and unabridged works of William
Shakespeare in three volumes. Given the leading place on the list as
Numbers 1, 2 and 3—Tragedies, Comedies, and Histories and Poems—these
volumes of over 1,200, 1,100 and 1,100 pages are scrupulously faithful
to the highest standards of scholarship. They are printed in large,
clear type, with special consideration for readability, and are bound
for durability in a format distinguished for its beauty and utility.
Each volume is implemented with Notes and a Glossary. (<em>Fall 1943</em>)</p>

ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from <em>The Complete Works
of Shakespeare</em>, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904),
and its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20
vols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and
Oxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its
text publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text,
Commins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the
request that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to
William T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).</p>
<p>At least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the <em>New
Republic</em>, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very
agreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be
congratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an
omission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right
to know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who
has done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer,
“Editions of Shakespeare,” <em>New Republic</em>, 10 January 1944, p. 57).</p>
<p>The drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated
graphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the
<em>Tragedies</em>, red for the <em>Comedies</em>, blue for the <em>Histories and
Poems</em>). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis
Miller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the
original jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the
second printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25
August 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the
proof stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare
jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present
a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is
altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.</p>
<p>Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets,
so that while they are held together by a common thread of
recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have
its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely
that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I
continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in
other colors.</p>
<p>I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I
ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam
Goldwyn, and give me what I want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML
to keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World
War. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the
fall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by
different jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the
only printings during the war.</p>
<p>The war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but
it took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from
wartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be
three or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted
because of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to
Mr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation,
which made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95
cents and break even, was an additional complication.</p>
<p>The Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time
each volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume
set.</p>

<p>It was Klopfer’s idea to divide the ML Shakespeare into six volumes. He
wrote to Cerf, “It is impossible to do the Shakespeare in the Modern
Library and break even so I have hit on the brilliant scheme of doing
the Comedies, Tragedies and Histories in two volumes each, numbered 1
and 1A, 2 and 2A, 3 and 3A. I think we can produce 15,000 sets of these
books for October 1st delivery. We can make our normal margin of profit
and I think we can sell a good chunk of them this Fall. It will be years
until we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the
meantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume
sets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The
printing order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21
May 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July.</p>
<p>Each volume was sold individually. An unfortunate result of splitting
the Shakespeare volumes was that the notes and glossary were in the
second volume of each two-volume set.</p>

<p>Duplicate plates of Shakespeare’s <em>Histories</em>, <em>Comedies</em>, and
<em>Histories and Poems</em> with ornamental headpieces added on the first page
of each play (title and cast of characters) and at the beginning of each
act were originally made in 1944 for printings in the Illustrated Modern
Library. All three Shakespeare volumes were projected for inclusion in
the Illustrated ML but only the <em>Tragedies</em> (IML 14) and <em>Comedies</em> (IML
15) were published.</p>
<p>The numbering of the six Shakespeare volumes changed to ML 2–7 in fall
1959 because new business machines acquired by Random House could not
handle number-letter combinations. The shift made it necessary to assign
new numbers to four other ML titles. <em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em>
(509) moved from ML 4 to 1, Douglas’s <em>South Wind</em> (114) from ML 5 to
304, Ibsen’s <em>Six Plays</em> (490) from ML 6 to 305, and <em>Wisdom of
Confucius</em> (312) from ML 7 to 306.</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1943\n\n## 1943\n\n### General\n\nBy 1943 the impact of gasoline rationing and other wartime restrictions\nhad reduced the ways in which people could spend leisure time away from\nhome. They turned in large numbers to reading as an alternative. Demand\nfor books was such that almost anything publishers brought out was\nsnatched-up. Few publishers had ever encountered such demand for books\nand the experience was dazzling. But it also had drawbacks. “When you\nare able to sell any junk that you can get between covers,” Cerf\ncommented, “it takes the kick out of putting over the really good\nnumbers” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943). Between 1942\nand 1943, sales of ML books increased from $339,902 to $596,454.\n\nThe war brought not only increased demand for books in general but also\nshifts in demand for certain types of books. Books dealing with the war\nitself were popular. But there also seems to have been increased demand\nfor books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry\nand philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a\ndisproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong\namong men in the service.\n\nThe Modern Library’s most notable new venture in the 1940s was a series\ncalled the Illustrated Modern Library. It was launched in 1943 in the\nmidst of the war. Each volume contained specially commissioned\nillustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell,\nSalvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz\nKredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes\nwere one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in\nindividually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943\nin time for the Christmas season. Fourteen additional titles were issued\nbetween 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library\ninitially sold for $1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war\nforced the discontinuation of the series.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nSeven titles were added to the series and three were discontinued,\nbringing the total number of titles in the list to 231.\n\n### Format\n\nTitles published in 1943 were 7¼ x 4⅞ inch page size with individually\ndesigned title pages. Many of the title pages were designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, who set them at his Spiral Press and made electrotype plates\nfor the use of the Modern Library’s regular printers. The binding, also\ndesigned by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth\nlinen. Blumenthal’s binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or\ndark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped\nin gold. Kent’s torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on\nthe spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were\nbordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside\neach panel.\n\nThe bindings were red, blue, green, or gray. Unlike the balloon cloth\nbindings used from 1929 through spring 1939, each printing of a given\ntitle was available in only one color.\n\nRockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a\ncentral panel of 1¾ by 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer,\nsurrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the\ntorchbearers; for the rest of the endpapers, there were torchbearers on\nthe paste-down and free endpapers facing each other, light brownish gray\n(63); endpapers in medium orange (53).\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Du Maurier, *Rebecca* xShakespeare; Giants through G62;\njackets: 291. (Fall) Shakespeare xJefferson, *Life and Selected\nWritings*; Giants through G63; jackets: 292.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nMcKeon had an idea for a collection entitled *Medieval Philosophers*.\nCerf asked Hoyns for reprint rights to Fosdick’s *On Being a Real\nPerson*, saying it was “one of the finest books that has been published\nin the past ten years,” and offering a $5,000 advance (Cerf to Hoyns, 12\nNovember 1943).\n\nHoyns suggested Silone’s *The Seed Beneath the Snow* and Algren’s *Never\nCome Morning* for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 20 May 1943).\n\nCerf declined to add an Elizabeth Bowen novel, noting “I don’t think\nthat there will be a sufficient demand for any of Elizabeth Bowen’s\nnovels to justify such an addition to the Modern Library series” (Cerf\nto Brown, 20 July 1943).\n\n### New titles\n\nBoethius, Thomas à Kempis, Browne, *Consolation of Philosophy* (1943)\n359\n\nDu Maurier, *Rebecca* (1943) 360\n\nCerf, ed., *Great Modern Short Stories* (1943) 361\n\nAristotle, *Politics* (1943) 362\n\nWharton, *Age of Innocence* (1943) 363\n\nShakespeare, *Tragedies*, 1 vol.

Published February 1943. *WR* 13 March 1943.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple\nClassics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of *The\nImitation of Christ* is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M.\nDent, 1910). The text of *Religio Medici* probably derives from *The\nReligio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne* (Everyman’s\nLibrary, 1906).\n\nEdman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for\nhis work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000\nwords that would include discussions of the three individual works. When\nit arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind\nof introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the\nModern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).\n\nCerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of\nBoetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of\nChicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical\nLibrary was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new\none (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).\n\nJ. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland,\nnoted that *Religio Medici* was on the Index and warned that its\ninclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised\nusing a different translation of *The Imitation of Christ*. “If you\ncould use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a\nProtestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this\nwould make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio\nMedici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November\n1942).\n\nEckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his\nopinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the\nfact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough\nliterate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point\nof view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral\nviewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers.

In addition to the ML they were used by Doubleday’s\nSun Dial Press, Blakiston Co., Book League of America, and International\nCollector’s Library. The 360.2 plates reduced the length of the book by\n100 pages by using smaller type and squeezing forty lines of text (five\nmore than 360.1) to the page, thus significantly reducing printing\ncosts. Both sets of plates used by the ML had been designed for\nfull-sized books and in the ML’s compact format produced a type page\nwith uncomfortably narrow margins.\n\n### 361\n\n**BENNETT A. CERF, ed.

Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from *The Complete Works\nof Shakespeare*, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904),\nand its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20\nvols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and\nOxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its\ntext publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text,\nCommins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the\nrequest that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to\nWilliam T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).\n\nAt least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the *New\nRepublic*, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very\nagreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be\ncongratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an\nomission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right\nto know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who\nhas done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer,\n“Editions of Shakespeare,” *New Republic*, 10 January 1944, p. 57).\n\nThe drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated\ngraphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the\n*Tragedies*, red for the *Comedies*, blue for the *Histories and\nPoems*). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis\nMiller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the\noriginal jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the\nsecond printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25\nAugust 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the\nproof stage:\n\n> The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare\n> jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present\n> a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is\n> altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.\n>\n> Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets,\n> so that while they are held together by a common thread of\n> recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have\n> its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely\n> that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I\n> continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in\n> other colors.\n>\n> I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I\n> ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam\n> Goldwyn, and give me what I want.\n\nThe length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML\nto keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World\nWar. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the\nfall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by\ndifferent jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the\nonly printings during the war.\n\nThe war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but\nit took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from\nwartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be\nthree or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted\nbecause of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to\nMr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation,\nwhich made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95\ncents and break even, was an additional complication.\n\nThe Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time\neach volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume\nset.\n\n#### 364b.

He\nwrote to Cerf, “It is impossible to do the Shakespeare in the Modern\nLibrary and break even so I have hit on the brilliant scheme of doing\nthe Comedies, Tragedies and Histories in two volumes each, numbered 1\nand 1A, 2 and 2A, 3 and 3A. I think we can produce 15,000 sets of these\nbooks for October 1st delivery. We can make our normal margin of profit\nand I think we can sell a good chunk of them this Fall. It will be years\nuntil we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the\nmeantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume\nsets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The\nprinting order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21\nMay 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July.\n\nEach volume was sold individually. An unfortunate result of splitting\nthe Shakespeare volumes was that the notes and glossary were in the\nsecond volume of each two-volume set.\n\n#### 364c.

All three Shakespeare volumes were projected for inclusion in\nthe Illustrated ML but only the *Tragedies* (IML 14) and *Comedies* (IML\n15) were published.\n\nThe numbering of the six Shakespeare volumes changed to ML 2–7 in fall\n1959 because new business machines acquired by Random House could not\nhandle number-letter combinations. The shift made it necessary to assign\nnew numbers to four other ML titles. *The Modern Library Dictionary*\n(509) moved from ML 4 to 1, Douglas’s *South Wind* (114) from ML 5 to\n304, Ibsen’s *Six Plays* (490) from ML 6 to 305, and *Wisdom of\nConfucius* (312) from ML 7 to 306.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nShakespeare, *The Tragedies of Shakespeare* (Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Comedies of Shakespeare* (1 vol., 1943–1947; 2 vols.\n1947–1971; Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Histories and Poems of Shakespeare* (1 vol.,\n1943–1947; 2 vols., 1947–1971)\n\n### 365\n\n**WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

They turned in large numbers to reading as an alternative. Demand\nfor books was such that almost anything publishers brought out was\nsnatched-up. Few publishers had ever encountered such demand for books\nand the experience was dazzling. But it also had drawbacks. “When you\nare able to sell any junk that you can get between covers,” Cerf\ncommented, “it takes the kick out of putting over the really good\nnumbers” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943). Between 1942\nand 1943, sales of ML books increased from $339,902 to $596,454.\n\nThe war brought not only increased demand for books in general but also\nshifts in demand for certain types of books. Books dealing with the war\nitself were popular. But there also seems to have been increased demand\nfor books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry\nand philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a\ndisproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong\namong men in the service.\n\nThe Modern Library’s most notable new venture in the 1940s was a series\ncalled the Illustrated Modern Library. It was launched in 1943 in the\nmidst of the war. Each volume contained specially commissioned\nillustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell,\nSalvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz\nKredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes\nwere one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in\nindividually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943\nin time for the Christmas season. Fourteen additional titles were issued\nbetween 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library\ninitially sold for $1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war\nforced the discontinuation of the series.",
  "numberOfTitles": "Seven titles were added to the series and three were discontinued,\nbringing the total number of titles in the list to 231.",
  "format": "Titles published in 1943 were 7¼ x 4⅞ inch page size with individually\ndesigned title pages. Many of the title pages were designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, who set them at his Spiral Press and made electrotype plates\nfor the use of the Modern Library’s regular printers. The binding, also\ndesigned by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth\nlinen. Blumenthal’s binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or\ndark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped\nin gold. Kent’s torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on\nthe spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were\nbordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside\neach panel.\n\nThe bindings were red, blue, green, or gray. Unlike the balloon cloth\nbindings used from 1929 through spring 1939, each printing of a given\ntitle was available in only one color.\n\nRockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a\ncentral panel of 1¾ by 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer,\nsurrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the\ntorchbearers; for the rest of the endpapers, there were torchbearers on\nthe paste-down and free endpapers facing each other, light brownish gray\n(63); endpapers in medium orange (53).",

Published February 1943. *WR* 13 March 1943.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple\nClassics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of *The\nImitation of Christ* is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M.\nDent, 1910). The text of *Religio Medici* probably derives from *The\nReligio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne* (Everyman’s\nLibrary, 1906).\n\nEdman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for\nhis work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000\nwords that would include discussions of the three individual works. When\nit arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind\nof introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the\nModern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).\n\nCerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of\nBoetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of\nChicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical\nLibrary was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new\none (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).\n\nJ. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland,\nnoted that *Religio Medici* was on the Index and warned that its\ninclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised\nusing a different translation of *The Imitation of Christ*. “If you\ncould use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a\nProtestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this\nwould make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio\nMedici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November\n1942).\n\nEckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his\nopinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the\nfact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough\nliterate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point\nof view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral\nviewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman\nto Commins, 11 November 1942).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943."

It mixes the great with the trivial; long\nstretches of it seem only pedantic categorizing; other stretches seem\nrather obvious. The whole is poorly proportioned and badly joined.\nBetween the oases of insight there are desert wastes of pedestrian\nanalysis.” Commins feared that the passage would discourage prospective\nreaders (Commins to Lerner, 25 November 1942); Lerner agreed and it was\nomitted.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,319 copies by 1 November 1943.\n\n#### 362b.

(*Spring 1944*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for November 1943. *WR* 30 October 1943. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from *The Complete Works\nof Shakespeare*, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904),\nand its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20\nvols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and\nOxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its\ntext publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text,\nCommins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the\nrequest that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to\nWilliam T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).\n\nAt least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the *New\nRepublic*, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very\nagreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be\ncongratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an\nomission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right\nto know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who\nhas done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer,\n“Editions of Shakespeare,” *New Republic*, 10 January 1944, p. 57).\n\nThe drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated\ngraphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the\n*Tragedies*, red for the *Comedies*, blue for the *Histories and\nPoems*). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis\nMiller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the\noriginal jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the\nsecond printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25\nAugust 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the\nproof stage:\n\n> The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare\n> jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present\n> a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is\n> altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.\n>\n> Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets,\n> so that while they are held together by a common thread of\n> recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have\n> its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely\n> that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I\n> continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in\n> other colors.\n>\n> I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I\n> ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam\n> Goldwyn, and give me what I want.\n\nThe length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML\nto keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World\nWar. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the\nfall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by\ndifferent jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the\nonly printings during the war.\n\nThe war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but\nit took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from\nwartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be\nthree or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted\nbecause of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to\nMr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation,\nwhich made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95\ncents and break even, was an additional complication.\n\nThe Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time\neach volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume\nset.\n\n#### 364b.

He\nwrote to Cerf, “It is impossible to do the Shakespeare in the Modern\nLibrary and break even so I have hit on the brilliant scheme of doing\nthe Comedies, Tragedies and Histories in two volumes each, numbered 1\nand 1A, 2 and 2A, 3 and 3A. I think we can produce 15,000 sets of these\nbooks for October 1st delivery. We can make our normal margin of profit\nand I think we can sell a good chunk of them this Fall. It will be years\nuntil we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the\nmeantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume\nsets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The\nprinting order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21\nMay 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July.\n\nEach volume was sold individually. An unfortunate result of splitting\nthe Shakespeare volumes was that the notes and glossary were in the\nsecond volume of each two-volume set.\n\n#### 364c.

The shift made it necessary to assign\nnew numbers to four other ML titles. *The Modern Library Dictionary*\n(509) moved from ML 4 to 1, Douglas’s *South Wind* (114) from ML 5 to\n304, Ibsen’s *Six Plays* (490) from ML 6 to 305, and *Wisdom of\nConfucius* (312) from ML 7 to 306.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nShakespeare, *The Tragedies of Shakespeare* (Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Comedies of Shakespeare* (1 vol., 1943–1947; 2 vols.\n1947–1971; Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Histories and Poems of Shakespeare* (1 vol.,\n1943–1947; 2 vols., 1947–1971)"
