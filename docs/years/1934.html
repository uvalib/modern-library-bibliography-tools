<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1934</h1>
<h2>1934</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer published the first authorized American edition of
James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> in January 1934. The book appeared under the
Random House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The
Modern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of
the firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back
copies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and
Company, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate
Sylvia Beach. <em>Ulysses</em> was officially banned in the United States and
tourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at
customs.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell
<em>Ulysses</em> before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of
the Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the
work bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to
be seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and
attorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random
House. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized
the literary stature of <em>Ulysses</em> and concluded that “nowhere does it
tend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into
the United States was overturned.</p>
<p>The Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey’s decision, a foreword
by Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at
$3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH
edition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over
$30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). <em>Ulysses</em> (G50) was
added to ML Giants in 1940.</p>
<p>Other trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint
included a four-volume edition of Proust’s <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>,
Gertrude Stein’s <em>Four Saints in Three Acts</em>, volumes of poetry by W. H.
Auden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play
<em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>, and William Saroyan’s <em>Daring Young Man on the
Flying Trapeze</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Printing technologies: letterpress and offset lithography</strong></p>
<p>All ML books before 1934 appear to have been printed from letterpress
plates. Letterpress is a relief technology. The printing surface is
raised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal,
Linotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which
is cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface
is inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates
cast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the
nineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than
one printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of
standing type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was
a metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each
page allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways,
depending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or
thirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early
1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was
likely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus
saving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher
anticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The
ML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings.
All ML books were printed from plates.</p>
<p>When the ML reprinted copyrighted works it tried whenever possible to
use the original publisher’s letterpress plates or duplicates of the
original plates. The original plates were usually designed for a
full-sized trade edition, not the ML’s compact format. This explains why
many ML books printed from the original publisher’s plates had
uncomfortably narrow margins. In some cases the only way the ML could
print from the original publisher’s plates was to cut off the running
heads, as it did with Anatole France’s <em>Revolt of the Angels</em> (163). The
introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 enhanced the appearance
of ML books and made it easier to print from original publishers’
plates.</p>
<p>Offset lithography is a planographic technology where the printing area
of a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed
into the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and
etching). A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is
based on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a
lithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink;
non-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink.
Offset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to
be printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a
previously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed
from metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of
letterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed
sheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the
number of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives
are placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The
plate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts
differently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the
printing and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing
possible” (Marshall Lee, <em>Bookmaking</em>, 2d ed., 1979, p. 132).
Letterpress printing typically involves a separate plate for each page;
offset plates typically print an entire side of a sheet at a time.
Modern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates
for each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant
printing methodology, some printers appear to have stored the
lithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates
were stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic
printing were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not
until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by
this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a
major book-printing industry” (p. 136).</p>
<p>Unlike relief plates, lithographic plates are lightweight and flexible.
They are attached to one cylinder of the printing press. The plate is
treated so that the printing areas accept greasy printer’s ink and repel
water. In the press, the plate is coated with a thin film of water,
which prevents ink from adhering to non-printing areas; another roller
applies printer’s ink which adheres to the images to be printed.</p>
<p>Lithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or
“offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed
directly to paper. The inked image is “offset” to a second cylinder
covered with a rubber blanket which in turn transfers the image to paper
carried by a third cylinder. Lee indicates in <em>Bookmaking: The
Illustrated Guide to Design/Production/Editing</em> (2nd ed., 1979),
“Several advantages are gained by printing on a rubber blanket first
instead of directly on paper: (a) the plates last longer, (b) less water
comes in contact with the paper, (c) the resilient rubber cylinder
permits printing finer copy on rougher paper, and (d) the speed is
increased” (p. 137).</p>
<p>Since letterpress printing transfers ink directly from relief plates or
standing type to paper, the type surface is wrong reading so that the
printed image will be right reading. The extra step in offset
lithography means that lithographic plates are right reading and can be
read in the same way that a printed page is read. The inked image on the
offset cylinder is wrong reading, and the image transferred to paper is
right reading.</p>
<p>The ML occasionally resorted to offset lithography before the 1960s when
the original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the ML’s
format. At that period offset lithography was more expensive than
letterpress printing and the quality was considered to be inferior, but
it allowed the ML to avoid the cost of a new typesetting. The ML could
photograph the pages of a printed book, reduce the dimensions of the
type page photographically, and make offset plates from the negatives.</p>
<p>The first ML book printed by offset lithography appears to have been
Frank Norris’s <em>The Pit</em> (272), published in August 1934. Parkway
Printing Co., the ML’s regular printers, did not have an offset
department before 1955, and the ML had the book printed by Polygraphic
Printing Co. of America, a New York shop that specialized in offset
lithography. Other ML titles printed from offset lithographic plates
before the mid-1960s include Newton, <em>Amenities of Book Collecting</em>
(1935: 287), Malraux, <em>Man’s Fate</em> (1936: 294), Whitman, <em>Leaves of
Grass</em> (1940: G48), Bemelmans, <em>My War with the United States</em> (1941:
343), and Thurber, <em>The Thurber Carnival</em> (1957: 496). The introduction
of the ML’s larger format in 1939 allowed later printings of <em>Man’s
Fate</em> to be made from the original publisher’s letterpress plates.
<em>Man’s Fate</em> was the only ML title printed in succession from offset
plates, letterpress plates, and then again from offset plates when the
ML switched to offset lithographic printing for most of its titles in
the mid 1960s.</p>
<p>The cost of printing by offset lithography dropped below that of
letterpress printing around 1963. Over the next few years the ML
converted most of its books to offset. Today nearly all commercially
published books are printed by offset lithography, and letterpress
printing is largely confined to small presses that print books in
limited editions from handset type.</p>
<p>Several ML books published in the “reissue” format in the 1980s reverted
to letterpress printing, presumably to capture price breaks for using
idle letterpress equipment after most book publishers had switched to
offset lithography. Some of these were printed from letterpress plates
that were worn and battered from decades of use; the appearance of these
books is distinctly inferior to those printed from offset plates. When
the ML switched to offset printing in the mid-1960s, it tried to
photograph first ML printings or the earliest printings it could find in
order to avoid worn type.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Thirteen new titles were added and twelve were discontinued, bringing
the number of titles in the regular ML to 212. Five new titles were
published in ML Giants; by the end of 1934 the Giants included sixteen
titles in seventeen volumes.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format in
balloon cloth binding D with the Kent endpaper in orange. Each title was
available in red, blue, green, and brown cloth with the top edge stained
the same color as the binding.</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type and <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>. All new titles had the
3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:</p>
<p>BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER</p>
<p>T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y</p>
<p>NEW YORK</p>
<p>The title pages of two fall 1934 titles, Veblen, <em>Theory of the Leisure
Class</em> (274) and Heyward, <em>Porgy</em> (275), omitted spaces between the
letters in the second line of the imprint:</p>
<p>BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER</p>
<p>THE MODERN LIBRARY</p>
<p>NEW YORK</p>
<p>The imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line
format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing
firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and
Klopfer as partners.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped
in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold
above the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued
to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each
title published simultaneously in all four bindings.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange
endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930
through spring 1939 except for Reed, <em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em>
(1935) and three spring 1939 titles, all of which were published in the
larger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning fall 1939. An
enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The
central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the
surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to
fill the larger space.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>All but two 1934 titles were published in individually designed
pictorial jackets. Veblen, <em>Theory of the Leisure Class</em> (274) and
Virgil, <em>Works</em> (277) were published in individually designed
non-pictorial jackets.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Caldwell, <em>God’s Little Acre</em> xHeyward, <em>Porgy</em>; Giants through
G14; jackets: 225 (=fall 1933, fall 1934). (Fall) Heyward, <em>Porgy</em>
xHamsun, <em>Growth of the Soil</em>; Giants through G17; jackets: 225 (=fall
1933, spring 1934). <em>Note:</em> Titles scheduled for January publication
were printed late in the preceding year; ML lists inside the jackets and
at the end of the volumes are typically those of the preceding fall.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf made another attempt to secure James Stephens’s <em>Crock of Gold</em> for
the ML (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 19 March 1934). Six years
earlier Macmillan had turned down an advance of $4,000 against royalties
of 12 cents a copy—more than the ML paid for all but a select handful of
titles. <em>The Crock of Gold</em> was still selling too well in its original
American edition for Macmillan to consider a reprint. It never appeared
in the ML.</p>
<p>Little, Brown turned down an offer by Cerf to reprint <em>Mutiny on the
Bounty</em> by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Alfred R. McIntyre of
Little, Brown indicated that he doubted if anyone would be allowed to
publish an inexpensive reprint of the book (Cerf to McIntyre, 20 July
1934; McIntyre to Cerf, 23 July 1934). Cerf was undeterred and made
offers for the <em>Bounty</em> trilogy.</p>
<p>Cerf was also beginning to think about a book on Judaism. He wrote to
Arnold Zweig soliciting his suggestions for the series and indicated,
“In particular, I would like to do some history of the Jews in the
Modern Library. Have you any suggestions along this line?” (Cerf to
Zweig, 24 July 1934). He repeated his interest two years later in a
letter to Harold Guinzburg of Viking Press (Cerf to Guinzburg, 3 March
1936). It took twenty years for this goal to be accomplished. Two books
on Judaism compiled for Random House, <em>The Wisdom of Israel</em>, edited by
Lewis Browne (1945) and <em>Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People</em>,
edited by Leo W. Schwarz (1956) were reprinted in ML Giants in 1956 and
1962.</p>
<p>Dale Warren of Houghton Mifflin Co. suggested a ML edition of Dorothy
Richardson’s <em>Pilgrimage</em>, the lengthy novel sequence published in the
U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf. He noted that “the whole stream of
consciousness business was really started by Dorothy Richardson” and
added, “I should think you could buy the rights for a song, and get some
sale—although you would of course be making one of those superb gestures
for which the Cerf-Klopfer twins are justly noted” (Warren to Cerf, 30
January 1934). Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when
he was in Boston in September. “My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin
have a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are
trying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like
ourselves” (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934).</p>
<p>Aaron Sussman of Spier &amp; Sussman, the ML’s advertising agency, suggested
a complete edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes’s <em>Breakfast Papers</em>
(Sussman to Cerf, 14 November 1934). Cerf replied, “We steered clear of
Holmes and his pals as far as the Modern Library is concerned because
we’ve had such rotten luck with Franklin and Longfellow volumes. It
makes me believe that people who want this sort of thing are not
inclined to look for it in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Sussman, 15
November 1934). Sales of <em>The Poems of Longfellow</em> (235) and <em>The
Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other
Writings</em> (236) improved in the 1940s and 1950s, when Longfellow ranked
in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles and Franklin ranked in the
second quarter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>The Enormous Room</em> is a book of immense proportions. Only in a narrow
sense is it an indictment of war. The filth and the futility of war
are pitilessly revealed, but even more is it a revelation of the
debasement and glory of youth. Written with a fiery imagination and
the keenest sensitiveness, it is none the less a book of the most
spontaneous realism, and as such holds through the years a place by
itself among the few important books produced by the World War. (<em>Fall
1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1922. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Published January 1934. <em>WR</em> 27
January 1934. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.</p>
<p>Cerf rejected <em>The Enormous Room</em> when Cummings’s agent suggested a ML
edition in 1928: “I never considered E. E. Cumming’s [<em>sic</em>] ‘Enormous
Room’ because, in my opinion, it is one of the most over-rated books of
our time” (Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt &amp; Brandt, to Cerf, 18 April 1928;
Cerf to Baumgarten, 21 April 1928). He later changed his mind.</p>
<p>Cummings’s bibliographer wrote in 1960: “Cummings’ ‘Introduction’, his
father’s ‘Foreword’ and the restoration, under the direct supervision of
the author, of the original manuscript text makes the ‘Modern Library’
edition . . . the most authoritative edition issued to date” (Firmage,
p. 5).</p>
<p><em>The Enormous Room</em> sold 2,749 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
Among the few important novels which have survived since the end of
World War One, <em>The Enormous Room</em> still holds a distinguished place
in American fiction. Although it reveals the filth and futility of war
pitilessly, it is not essentially a war novel; it is, rather, an
affirmation of the aspirations and an interpretation of the thwartings
of young men confronted by the fierce reality of battle, the taut
periods of preparation for conflict and the grim aftermath of trial by
fire. Written with imagination and sensibility, <em>The Enormous Room</em> is
a novel spontaneous in realism and rewarding in insights into the
enduring spirit of youth. (<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
It is not without reason that <em>The Good Earth</em> has been the most
successful book since <em>Quo Vadis</em>, 38 years ago. Its immense
popularity can be attributed to the humanity of the people who come to
life in its pages and to the Biblical simplicity of its writing. It is
a book that takes root deep in the heart of mankind. <em>The Good Earth</em>
is more than a mere portrayal of Oriental life; it is the epic of
man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world.
(<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by John Day Co., 1931. ML edition (266.1, pp.
[1]–[375]) printed from Day plates with battered page numeral “375”
removed. Published February 1934. <em>WR</em> 10 February 1934. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1970.</p>
<p>The ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major
best-seller like <em>The Good Earth</em>, which headed the best-seller list for
two years (1931–32). Grosset &amp; Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher
of hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap
between its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint
rights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933
about a ML edition of <em>The Good Earth</em>, he was told that it would be
many months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf
to Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January
1933). Arrangements were made later that year for <em>The Good Earth</em> to
appear first in Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and
shortly thereafter in the ML.</p>
<p>Buck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long
letter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies
to Her Chinese Critic” in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> (15 January
1933).</p>
<p>Three months after Pocket Books published <em>The Good Earth</em> as a
twenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this
book holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many
other editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our
Modern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative
sales figures for the Grosset &amp; Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for
the eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following:
Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH
box 141, folder D1).</p>
<p>Sales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War,
reflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced
interest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first
quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100
best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p><em>The Good Earth</em> was shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML
published its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.</p>
<p>The ML’s reprint contract for <em>The Good Earth</em> was terminated in July
1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies.
Together with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML
stock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
The great and lasting popularity of <em>The Good Earth</em> can be attributed
to the simple humanity of the people who come to life in its pages.
Written in 1930, this novel brought Pearl S. Buck to the admiring
attention of the world and was influential, eighteen years later, in
earning for her the Nobel Prize for Literature. She was the first and
only American woman so to be honored. Author of many books since <em>The
Good Earth</em>, Pearl S. Buck is almost always identified with and
remembered by this epic of the soil. It is a novel that has taken root
and has grown in strength with the passage of the years. Far more than
a portrayal of Oriental life, <em>The Good</em> <em>Earth</em> is the ever-heroic
story of man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of
the world. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New bibliographical edition published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1944/45, with
a new foreword by the author. ML edition printed from a duplicate set of
the plates used for Grosset &amp; Dunlap printings.</p>
<p>An internal RH memo (Regina Spirito to Manny Harper, 5 May 1945)
indicates that new plates were being made for <em>The Good Earth</em> along
with Maugham’s <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (199), Well’s <em>Tono-Bungay</em> (225), and
Maugham’s <em>Moon and Sixpence</em> (283). It is not known whether the ML made
duplicates of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap plates or whether the two sets of
plates were made at the same time.</p>
<p>The new typesetting replaces Buck’s introduction with a one-page
foreword by Buck dated September 1944. By eliminating running heads and
increasing the lines of text on each page from 31 to 37, the new
typesetting reduces the length of for Buck’s text by 61 pages.</p>
<p>The ML plates are identical to those used by Grosset &amp; Dunlap with the
exception of the title page, the addition of the series title and a
publisher’s note to the half title, and the addition of the RH device to
the verso of the title page along with the following statement within a
single-rule frame: “<em>Random House</em> <span class="smallcaps">is the

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The selection of a detective story for inclusion in the Modern Library
series provided an embarrassment of riches. Yet there was neither
hesitation nor reservation in the choice of <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. Its
authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and
sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and
picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and
resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell
Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which
Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition
(pp. [v], [xi]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934.
<em>WR</em> 31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall
1949.</p>
<p>Hammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people
who served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had
no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the
private detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite
a few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your
private detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my
colleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes
manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of
himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in
contact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp.
viii–ix).</p>
<p><em>The Maltese Falcon</em> was originally published as a five-part serial
(September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazine <em>Black Mask</em>. “The
book was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two
thousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the
changes were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to
have been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).</p>
<p>There were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and
fifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (<em>The Maltese
Falcon</em>, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title
page verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first
in the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been
examined.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version
starring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period.
The 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears
to have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued
in 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph
C. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950). The ML remaindered 4,774 copies through
the Harlem Book Co in 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
When the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, through its
agent, John S. Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of <em>God’s
Little Acre</em> on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and
women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin
Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case,
declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.”
The Modern Library now adds <em>God’s Little Acre</em> to its list as a
serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp.
[v], [1]–[311]) printed from Viking plates, which were
subsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown &amp; Co.
Published April 1934. <em>WR</em> 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies.
Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Caldwell received $50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf
to Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have
the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have
mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly
trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and
girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee
winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills
of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them.
I hope so. (p. ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition
was realized most fully after the introduction of mass market
paperbacks. The paperback edition of <em>God’s Little Acre</em>, published in
1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by
Penguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its
first nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern
paperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million
copies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).</p>
<p>The biographical note and bibliography on p. [vi] were updated at
Caldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27
December 1938). The plates and publishing rights to <em>God’s Little Acre</em>
were transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall
1939 and passed to Little, Brown &amp; Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged
its printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one
printing under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted
that the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934
and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill,
Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying
royalties of 12 cents a copy.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total
sales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to
James Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).</p>

<p>Erskine Caldwell’s story of a Georgia dirt farmer, Ty Ty Walden, and
of Ty Ty’s sons and intensely attractive daughters has achieved a
popularity that has been phenomenal and undiminishing. With almost
seven million copies in print, <em>God’s Little Acre</em> has attained the
status of an all-time permanent best-seller. Its comedy of the man who
dedicated an acre of land to God—a barren, useless acre—has become
virtually a part of our national folklore, and the novel is now
generally recognized as a classic. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>

The world-wide revival of interest in the works of Charles Dickens
makes this completely new edition of his favorite novel an

simultaneous with the appearance of the recently discovered <em>The Life

fortunate readers who are in the enviable position of coming upon
<em>David Copperfield</em> for the first time. This edition contains
thirty-nine reproductions from the original illustrations by “Phiz”

</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
May 1934. <em>WR</em> 12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971.</p>
<p>Publication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May.
Norris’s <em>The Pit</em> (272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed
until August. Delays in production of <em>The Pit</em> appear to have been
primarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date
of <em>David Copperfield</em> allowed the ML to benefit from anticipated
publicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’s <em>Life of Our
Lord</em>, which was written for his children and published by Simon and
Schuster in May 1934.</p>
<p><em>David Copperfield</em> sold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and
forty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series.
Thackeray’s <em>Vanity Fair</em> (258) outsold <em>David Copperfield</em> at both
periods, but <em>David Copperfield</em> was Dickens’s most popular title in the
ML. <em>The Pickwick Papers</em> (247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the
top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely
made it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> (284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43,
was low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among
the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.</p>

Twenty-four centuries have witnessed the fulfillment of Thucydides’
intention to make his work “a possession for ever, not the rhetorical
triumph of an hour.” Not only to students of history and statecraft,
but to enlightened readers of every shade of interest, <em>The
Peloponnesian War</em> provides an exact, eye-witness account of the
waning glory of Periclean Greece as a key to the present and a
prophecy of the future. The unabridged Crawley translation captures
all the vigor and penetration of “the first and greatest critical
historian.” (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
By now the fretful babblings of the prurient over the amatory
excursions of Messire Jurgen have subsided. Instead of bothering to
discover phallic parables in every casual allusion, adult readers take
the keenest delight in the nimble satire of this morality in behalf of
monogamy and common-sense. <em>Jurgen</em>, thanks to the obscenity seekers,
has become Cabell’s best-known novel. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Robert M. McBride &amp; Co., 1919. ML edition (pp.
[iii–iv], [xiii]–368) printed from McBride plates with the expanded
foreword first included in the eighth McBride printing. Published July
1934. <em>WR</em> 28 July 1934. Discontinued fall 1943.</p>
<p><em>Jurgen</em> was one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure
after they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a
$5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice
he offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’s <em>Cream of the Jest</em> or
<em>The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck</em> (Cerf to Mr. [Guy] Holt, McBride, 29
July 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition of <em>Beyond Life</em> (104)
two years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint
editions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained
strong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition
of Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).</p>
<p>McBride authorized a ML edition of <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> (131) in
1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer for <em>Jurgen</em>, but
the response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12
cents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to
permit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least
for the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and
particularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so
profitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way –
this despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the
sale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer
to Rose, 27 March 1928).</p>
<p>Grosset &amp; Dunlap published a reprint edition of <em>Jurgen</em> in its Novels
of Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in
publishing <em>Jurgen</em> in the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker,
McBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed
when the Grosset &amp; Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months
later, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we
can get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset &amp;
Dunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset &amp; Dunlap wrote
McBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t
directly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset &amp; Dunlap to McBride
&amp; Co., 16 November 1933).</p>

Frank Norris lived to complete only two-thirds of his planned trilogy,
<em>The Epic of Wheat</em>. <em>The Pit</em>, which is the second volume, created a
national furor and established Norris as the first and one of the
greatest realists in America. Today <em>The Pit</em> is not only a startling
exposé of the machinations of stock gamblers in the fundamental
necessity of life, but also an authentic picture of the frenzied
struggle for power that marked the end of American pioneer days and
the beginnings of its ventures in world markets. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1903. New bibliographical
edition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co.,
1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML
edition (pp. [v]–403) printed from offset plates photographically
reduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934. <em>WR</em> 25 August
1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
31 December 1940.</p>
<p>Robert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary,
was inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris in <em>Saturday Review
of Literature</em> (27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML
(de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML
edition of Norris’s <em>McTeague</em> or <em>The</em> <em>Octopus</em> three years earlier
(Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff
sent copies of <em>The Pit</em> and <em>McTeague</em> for his consideration. He noted
that <em>The Pit</em> had sold 189,455 copies in all editions while <em>McTeague</em>
had sold 67,272 copies and <em>The Octopus</em> had sold 59,779 copies (de
Graff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided that <em>The Pit</em>
“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July
1933). He appears to have been unaware that <em>McTeague</em> (57) was in the
ML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni
&amp; Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.</p>
<p>The plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition of <em>The Pit</em> were too large for
the ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would
have to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would
share the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think,
making some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.).
Meanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original
plates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the
Modern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios
in small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty
bad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you
think, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent
looking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing
Co., 29 August 1933).</p>
<p>Publication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed
until August; Dickens’s <em>David Copperfield</em> (269), originally scheduled
for August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production of
<em>The Pit</em> appears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end
of April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to
use” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was
made to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928
Argonaut edition. <em>The Pit</em> appears to have been the first ML title
printed by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive
than letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but
it would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and
make new letterpress plates.</p>
<p>Sales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing. <em>The Pit</em> was
discontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first
ML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on
the endpaper.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>The Great Gatsby</em> is a story of the fabulous 1920s, that incredible
period in American history that ended in a crash from which we are all
reeling still. The editors of <em>Time</em> Magazine report that Gatsby was
the “first racketeer in United States fiction.” Countless novels and
motion pictures have followed the pattern since, but <em>The Great
Gatsby</em> remains the most brilliant and understanding portrait of the
first mad days of the bootleg era. It is by all odds Scott
Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the
development of American literature can afford to overlook. (<em>Fall
1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp.
[xiii]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.
<em>WR</em> 29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.
Discontinued 1 January 1939.</p>
<p>Maxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML
edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to
announce the forthcoming publication of <em>Tender Is the Night</em>, which
appeared initially as a serial in <em>Scribner’s Magazine</em>, and added: “If
it goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why
don’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by
Gertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and
wrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it
had brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was
“creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see
Tanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted
to publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against
royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald
$50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934).
Including his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300
from the ML edition.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our
series” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf
about the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off
writing it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of
the approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week.
He appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs
of the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the
corrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the
introduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).</p>
<p>The ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original
introductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni &amp; Liveright
era, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction to <em>South
Wind</em> (114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition of <em>Mrs.
Dalloway</em> (168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of
this genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> was one of
the worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future
printings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like
the preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and
incoherance [<em>sic</em>], two qualities which the story that succeeds it
manages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to
reassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to
Fitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared,
“The preface <em>is</em> incoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but
simply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).</p>
<p>A 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is
inscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in
Tryon [North Carolina]” with the additional annotation at the top of
p. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington,
London; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the
ML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of
Maxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s
own hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv
&lt;modlib@thuban.owu.edu&gt;, 10 November 2011).</p>
<p><em>Tender Is the Night</em>, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published
in April 1934, five months before the ML edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.
By 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent
Cerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition of <em>Tender Is
the Night</em> if he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now
are essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the
correspondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the
preceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he
wrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity
. . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than
one in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads
them to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to
Cerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell
Perkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishing <em>This Side of Paradise,</em>
<em>The Great Gatsby</em>, and <em>Tender Is the Night</em> as an omnibus volume in
the ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli, <em>Some Sort of Epic
Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald</em>, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> were disappointing. The ML edition sold
about 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral
History, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal
enthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest
sellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott
Fitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s,
31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By
the early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> was
selling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).</p>
<p>There was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 after <em>The Great
Gatsby</em> was discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are
stamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as
remainders.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Since its original publication <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em> has
become a classic in its field, both for its economic analysis and for
its perspective on social values in America.</p>
<p>Some of its phrases—notably “conspicuous consumption”—have become
standard in our national vocabulary. Veblen’s examination of the
leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on
pecuniary culture is one of the masterly critiques of our
socio-economic development. The new point of view and method
elaborated by Veblen riddled the whole structure of economics as a
pseudo-social science and created instead an entirely original set of
economic categories, based on changing industrial conditions rather
than an inflexible system formulated from so-called eternal
principles.</p>
<p>Its irony, its rich accumulation of evidence and, above all, its
boldness of interpretation have kept <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em>
a vital work through the years.</p>

admission to the Modern Library, a truly indigenous opera by the
gifted composer, George Gershwin. <em>Porgy</em> is steeped in the atmosphere

of ‘Porgy’ this Fall, with George Gershwin music, will center new
attention on this book” (<em>PW</em>, 11 August 1934, p. 407). The Theatre
Guild had hoped that <em>Porgy and Bess</em> would be ready for the fall 1934
season (Alpert, p. 78), but the premier was delayed until October 1935,
a full year after the appearance of the ML edition.</p>

advance of $400 against the first 5,000 copies, but Macmillan was
planning to include it in their Modern Readers series (Klopfer to George
Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 5 October 1926). In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon
Phelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to
all of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we
could sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell
themselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML
paid Macmillan a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy
(Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was
president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada.</p>
<p>The ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used
for Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some
arrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML
edition in that format (David Mason, Fine &amp; Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN;
undated.)</p>
<p><em>Maria Chapdelaine</em> sold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title. In
1952, two years after the ML edition was discontinued, 3,494 copies were
remaindered through the Harlem Book Co.</p>

As a companion volume to Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> (No. 166) and <em>The Odyssey</em>
(No. 167), <em>Virgil’s Works</em> takes a prominent place among the classics
of antiquity on the Modern Library shelf. The prose translation by
J. W. Mackail of <em>The Aeneid</em>, <em>Eclogues</em> and <em>Georgics,</em> complete in
one volume, is acknowledgedly the most authentic, in letter and in

<p>Mackail’s translations of <em>The Aeneid</em> and <em>The Eclogues &amp; The Georgics</em>
were originally published in London in the 1880s and were in the U.S.
public domain. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published December 1934. <em>WR</em> 29 December 1934. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Cerf asked the textbook publisher F. S. Crofts what he thought of a
complete Virgil in the ML and asked him to recommend someone to write
the introduction (Cerf to Crofts, 28 March 1934).</p>
<p><em>Virgil’s Works</em> sold 4,277 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1934\n\n## 1934\n\n### General\n\nCerf and Klopfer published the first authorized American edition of\nJames Joyce’s *Ulysses* in January 1934. The book appeared under the\nRandom House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The\nModern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of\nthe firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back\ncopies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and\nCompany, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate\nSylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and\ntourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at\ncustoms.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell\n*Ulysses* before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of\nthe Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the\nwork bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to\nbe seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court,\nSouthern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and\nattorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random\nHouse. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized\nthe literary stature of *Ulysses* and concluded that “nowhere does it\ntend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into\nthe United States was overturned.\n\nThe Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey’s decision, a foreword\nby Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at\n$3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH\nedition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over\n$30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). *Ulysses* (G50) was\nadded to ML Giants in 1940.\n\nOther trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint\nincluded a four-volume edition of Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*,\nGertrude Stein’s *Four Saints in Three Acts*, volumes of poetry by W. H.\nAuden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play\n*Merrily We Roll Along*, and William Saroyan’s *Daring Young Man on the\nFlying Trapeze*.\n\n**Printing technologies: letterpress and offset lithography**\n\nAll ML books before 1934 appear to have been printed from letterpress\nplates. Letterpress is a relief technology. The printing surface is\nraised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal,\nLinotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which\nis cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface\nis inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates\ncast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the\nnineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than\none printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of\nstanding type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was\na metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each\npage allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways,\ndepending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or\nthirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early\n1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was\nlikely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus\nsaving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher\nanticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The\nML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings.\nAll ML books were printed from plates.\n\nWhen the ML reprinted copyrighted works it tried whenever possible to\nuse the original publisher’s letterpress plates or duplicates of the\noriginal plates. The original plates were usually designed for a\nfull-sized trade edition, not the ML’s compact format. This explains why\nmany ML books printed from the original publisher’s plates had\nuncomfortably narrow margins. In some cases the only way the ML could\nprint from the original publisher’s plates was to cut off the running\nheads, as it did with Anatole France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163). The\nintroduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 enhanced the appearance\nof ML books and made it easier to print from original publishers’\nplates.\n\nOffset lithography is a planographic technology where the printing area\nof a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed\ninto the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and\netching). A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is\nbased on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a\nlithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink;\nnon-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink.\nOffset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to\nbe printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a\npreviously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed\nfrom metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of\nletterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed\nsheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the\nnumber of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives\nare placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The\nplate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts\ndifferently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the\nprinting and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing\npossible” (Marshall Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2d ed., 1979, p. 132).\nLetterpress printing typically involves a separate plate for each page;\noffset plates typically print an entire side of a sheet at a time.\nModern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates\nfor each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant\nprinting methodology, some printers appear to have stored the\nlithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates\nwere stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic\nprinting were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not\nuntil the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by\nthis method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a\nmajor book-printing industry” (p. 136).\n\nUnlike relief plates, lithographic plates are lightweight and flexible.\nThey are attached to one cylinder of the printing press. The plate is\ntreated so that the printing areas accept greasy printer’s ink and repel\nwater. In the press, the plate is coated with a thin film of water,\nwhich prevents ink from adhering to non-printing areas; another roller\napplies printer’s ink which adheres to the images to be printed.\n\nLithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or\n“offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed\ndirectly to paper. The inked image is “offset” to a second cylinder\ncovered with a rubber blanket which in turn transfers the image to paper\ncarried by a third cylinder. Lee indicates in *Bookmaking: The\nIllustrated Guide to Design/Production/Editing* (2nd ed., 1979),\n“Several advantages are gained by printing on a rubber blanket first\ninstead of directly on paper: (a) the plates last longer, (b) less water\ncomes in contact with the paper, (c) the resilient rubber cylinder\npermits printing finer copy on rougher paper, and (d) the speed is\nincreased” (p. 137).\n\nSince letterpress printing transfers ink directly from relief plates or\nstanding type to paper, the type surface is wrong reading so that the\nprinted image will be right reading. The extra step in offset\nlithography means that lithographic plates are right reading and can be\nread in the same way that a printed page is read. The inked image on the\noffset cylinder is wrong reading, and the image transferred to paper is\nright reading.\n\nThe ML occasionally resorted to offset lithography before the 1960s when\nthe original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the ML’s\nformat. At that period offset lithography was more expensive than\nletterpress printing and the quality was considered to be inferior, but\nit allowed the ML to avoid the cost of a new typesetting. The ML could\nphotograph the pages of a printed book, reduce the dimensions of the\ntype page photographically, and make offset plates from the negatives.\n\nThe first ML book printed by offset lithography appears to have been\nFrank Norris’s *The Pit* (272), published in August 1934. Parkway\nPrinting Co., the ML’s regular printers, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955, and the ML had the book printed by Polygraphic\nPrinting Co. of America, a New York shop that specialized in offset\nlithography. Other ML titles printed from offset lithographic plates\nbefore the mid-1960s include Newton, *Amenities of Book Collecting*\n(1935: 287), Malraux, *Man’s Fate* (1936: 294), Whitman, *Leaves of\nGrass* (1940: G48), Bemelmans, *My War with the United States* (1941:\n343), and Thurber, *The Thurber Carnival* (1957: 496). The introduction\nof the ML’s larger format in 1939 allowed later printings of *Man’s\nFate* to be made from the original publisher’s letterpress plates.\n*Man’s Fate* was the only ML title printed in succession from offset\nplates, letterpress plates, and then again from offset plates when the\nML switched to offset lithographic printing for most of its titles in\nthe mid 1960s.\n\nThe cost of printing by offset lithography dropped below that of\nletterpress printing around 1963. Over the next few years the ML\nconverted most of its books to offset. Today nearly all commercially\npublished books are printed by offset lithography, and letterpress\nprinting is largely confined to small presses that print books in\nlimited editions from handset type.\n\nSeveral ML books published in the “reissue” format in the 1980s reverted\nto letterpress printing, presumably to capture price breaks for using\nidle letterpress equipment after most book publishers had switched to\noffset lithography. Some of these were printed from letterpress plates\nthat were worn and battered from decades of use; the appearance of these\nbooks is distinctly inferior to those printed from offset plates. When\nthe ML switched to offset printing in the mid-1960s, it tried to\nphotograph first ML printings or the earliest printings it could find in\norder to avoid worn type.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nThirteen new titles were added and twelve were discontinued, bringing\nthe number of titles in the regular ML to 212. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants; by the end of 1934 the Giants included sixteen\ntitles in seventeen volumes.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format in\nballoon cloth binding D with the Kent endpaper in orange. Each title was\navailable in red, blue, green, and brown cloth with the top edge stained\nthe same color as the binding.\n\n### Title page\n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and torchbearer A2. All new titles had the\n3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe title pages of two fall 1934 titles, Veblen, *Theory of the Leisure\nClass* (274) and Heyward, *Porgy* (275), omitted spaces between the\nletters in the second line of the imprint:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nTHE MODERN LIBRARY\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners.\n\n### Binding\n\nBalloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued\nto be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each\ntitle published simultaneously in all four bindings.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nRockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World*\n(1935) and three spring 1939 titles, all of which were published in the\nlarger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning fall 1939. An\nenlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The\ncentral panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the\nsurrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to\nfill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll but two 1934 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Veblen, *Theory of the Leisure Class* (274) and\nVirgil, *Works* (277) were published in individually designed\nnon-pictorial jackets.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Caldwell, *God’s Little Acre* xHeyward, *Porgy*; Giants through\nG14; jackets: 225 (=fall 1933, fall 1934). (Fall) Heyward, *Porgy*\nxHamsun, *Growth of the Soil*; Giants through G17; jackets: 225 (=fall\n1933, spring 1934). *Note:* Titles scheduled for January publication\nwere printed late in the preceding year; ML lists inside the jackets and\nat the end of the volumes are typically those of the preceding fall.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf made another attempt to secure James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* for\nthe ML (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 19 March 1934). Six years\nearlier Macmillan had turned down an advance of $4,000 against royalties\nof 12 cents a copy—more than the ML paid for all but a select handful of\ntitles. *The Crock of Gold* was still selling too well in its original\nAmerican edition for Macmillan to consider a reprint. It never appeared\nin the ML.\n\nLittle, Brown turned down an offer by Cerf to reprint *Mutiny on the\nBounty* by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Alfred R. McIntyre of\nLittle, Brown indicated that he doubted if anyone would be allowed to\npublish an inexpensive reprint of the book (Cerf to McIntyre, 20 July\n1934; McIntyre to Cerf, 23 July 1934). Cerf was undeterred and made\noffers for the *Bounty* trilogy.\n\nCerf was also beginning to think about a book on Judaism. He wrote to\nArnold Zweig soliciting his suggestions for the series and indicated,\n“In particular, I would like to do some history of the Jews in the\nModern Library. Have you any suggestions along this line?” (Cerf to\nZweig, 24 July 1934). He repeated his interest two years later in a\nletter to Harold Guinzburg of Viking Press (Cerf to Guinzburg, 3 March\n1936). It took twenty years for this goal to be accomplished. Two books\non Judaism compiled for Random House, *The Wisdom of Israel*, edited by\nLewis Browne (1945) and *Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People*,\nedited by Leo W. Schwarz (1956) were reprinted in ML Giants in 1956 and\n1962.\n\nDale Warren of Houghton Mifflin Co. suggested a ML edition of Dorothy\nRichardson’s *Pilgrimage*, the lengthy novel sequence published in the\nU.S. by Alfred A. Knopf. He noted that “the whole stream of\nconsciousness business was really started by Dorothy Richardson” and\nadded, “I should think you could buy the rights for a song, and get some\nsale—although you would of course be making one of those superb gestures\nfor which the Cerf-Klopfer twins are justly noted” (Warren to Cerf, 30\nJanuary 1934). Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when\nhe was in Boston in September. “My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin\nhave a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are\ntrying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like\nourselves” (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934).\n\nAaron Sussman of Spier & Sussman, the ML’s advertising agency, suggested\na complete edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes’s *Breakfast Papers*\n(Sussman to Cerf, 14 November 1934). Cerf replied, “We steered clear of\nHolmes and his pals as far as the Modern Library is concerned because\nwe’ve had such rotten luck with Franklin and Longfellow volumes. It\nmakes me believe that people who want this sort of thing are not\ninclined to look for it in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Sussman, 15\nNovember 1934). Sales of *The Poems of Longfellow* (235) and *The\nAutobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other\nWritings* (236) improved in the 1940s and 1950s, when Longfellow ranked\nin the first quarter of ML and Giant titles and Franklin ranked in the\nsecond quarter.\n\n### New titles\n\nCummings, *Enormous Room* (1934) 265\n\nBuck, *Good Earth* (1934) 266\n\nHammett, *Maltese Falcon* (1934) 267\n\nCaldwell, *God’s Little Acre* (1934) 268\n\nDickens, *David Copperfield* (1934) 269\n\nThucydides, *Complete Writings* (1934) 270\n\nCabell, *Jurgen* (1934) 271\n\nNorris, *The Pit* (1934) 272\n\nFitzgerald, *Great Gatsby* (1934) 273\n\nVeblen, *Theory of the Leisure Class* (1934) 274\n\nHeyward, *Porgy* (1934) 275\n\nHémon, *Maria Chapdelaine* (1934) 276\n\nVirgil, *Works* (1934) 277### Discontinued\n\nAndreyev, *Seven That Were Hanged* (1918)\n\nCarpenter, *Love’s Coming of Age* (1918)\n\nDostoyevsky, *Poor People* (1917)\n\nDreiser, *Twelve Men* (1928)\n\nFlaubert, *Temptation of St. Anthony* (1921)\n\nFrance, *Queen Pédauque* (1923)\n\nGeorge, *Bed of Roses* (1919)\n\nJames, *Daisy Miller; An International Episode* (1918)\n\nShaw, *An Unsocial Socialist* (1917)\n\nStrindberg, *Married* (1917)\n\nVillon, *Poems* (1918)\n\nWilde, *De Profundis* (1926)\\*\n\n\\**De Profundis* was added to Wilde, *Picture of Dorian Gray* (1.2b) in\n1934.\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 265\n\n**E.

He later changed his mind.\n\nCummings’s bibliographer wrote in 1960: “Cummings’ ‘Introduction’, his\nfather’s ‘Foreword’ and the restoration, under the direct supervision of\nthe author, of the original manuscript text makes the ‘Modern Library’\nedition . . . the most authoritative edition issued to date” (Firmage,\np. 5).\n\n*The Enormous Room* sold 2,749 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles.

ML edition (266.1, pp.\n\\[1\\]–\\[375\\]) printed from Day plates with battered page numeral “375”\nremoved. Published February 1934. *WR* 10 February 1934. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued fall 1970.\n\nThe ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major\nbest-seller like *The Good Earth*, which headed the best-seller list for\ntwo years (1931–32). Grosset & Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher\nof hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap\nbetween its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint\nrights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933\nabout a ML edition of *The Good Earth*, he was told that it would be\nmany months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf\nto Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January\n1933). Arrangements were made later that year for *The Good Earth* to\nappear first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and\nshortly thereafter in the ML.\n\nBuck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long\nletter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies\nto Her Chinese Critic” in the *New York Times Book Review* (15 January\n1933).\n\nThree months after Pocket Books published *The Good Earth* as a\ntwenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this\nbook holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many\nother editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our\nModern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative\nsales figures for the Grosset & Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for\nthe eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following:\nGrosset & Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH\nbox 141, folder D1).\n\nSales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War,\nreflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced\ninterest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n*The Good Earth* was shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML\npublished its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.\n\nThe ML’s reprint contract for *The Good Earth* was terminated in July\n1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies.\nTogether with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML\nstock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.\n\n#### 266.1b.

It is not known whether the ML made\nduplicates of the Grosset & Dunlap plates or whether the two sets of\nplates were made at the same time.\n\nThe new typesetting replaces Buck’s introduction with a one-page\nforeword by Buck dated September 1944. By eliminating running heads and\nincreasing the lines of text on each page from 31 to 37, the new\ntypesetting reduces the length of for Buck’s text by 61 pages.\n\nThe ML plates are identical to those used by Grosset & Dunlap with the\nexception of the title page, the addition of the series title and a\npublisher’s note to the half title, and the addition of the RH device to\nthe verso of the title page along with the following statement within a\nsingle-rule frame: “*Random House* <span class=\"smallcaps\">is the\npublisher of</span> | THE MODERN LIBRARY | <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">bennett a. cerf</span> | <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">donald s. klopfer</span> | <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">robert k. haas</span> | Manufactured in the United\nStates of America | Printed by Parkway Printing Company Bound by H.\nWolff”.\n\n### 267\n\n**DASHIELL HAMMETT.

Yet there was neither\n> hesitation nor reservation in the choice of *The Maltese Falcon*. Its\n> authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and\n> sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and\n> picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and\n> resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell\n> Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which\n> Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\], \\[xi\\]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934.\n*WR* 31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall\n1949.\n\nHammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people\nwho served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had\nno original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the\nprivate detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite\na few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your\nprivate detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my\ncolleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes\nmanner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of\nhimself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in\ncontact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp.\nviii–ix).\n\n*The Maltese Falcon* was originally published as a five-part serial\n(September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazine *Black Mask*. “The\nbook was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two\nthousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the\nchanges were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to\nhave been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).\n\nThere were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and\nfifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (*The Maltese\nFalcon*, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title\npage verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first\nin the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been\nexamined.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version\nstarring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period.\nThe 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears\nto have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued\nin 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph\nC. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950).

Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of *God’s\n> Little Acre* on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and\n> women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin\n> Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case,\n> declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.”\n> The Modern Library now adds *God’s Little Acre* to its list as a\n> serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp.\n\\[v\\], \\[1\\]–\\[311\\]) printed from Viking plates, which were\nsubsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown & Co.\nPublished April 1934. *WR* 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1970/71.\n\nCaldwell received $50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf\nto Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:\n\n> Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have\n> the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have\n> mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly\n> trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and\n> girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee\n> winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills\n> of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them.\n> I hope so. (p. ix)\n\nThe hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition\nwas realized most fully after the introduction of mass market\npaperbacks. The paperback edition of *God’s Little Acre*, published in\n1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by\nPenguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its\nfirst nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern\npaperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million\ncopies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).\n\nThe biographical note and bibliography on p. \\[vi\\] were updated at\nCaldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27\nDecember 1938). The plates and publishing rights to *God’s Little Acre*\nwere transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall\n1939 and passed to Little, Brown & Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged\nits printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one\nprinting under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted\nthat the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934\nand inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill,\nLittle, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying\nroyalties of 12 cents a copy.\n\nThe ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total\nsales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to\nJames Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).\n\n#### 268.1b.

McBride had authorized a ML edition of *Beyond Life* (104)\ntwo years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint\neditions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained\nstrong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition\nof Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).\n\nMcBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* (131) in\n1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer for *Jurgen*, but\nthe response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12\ncents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to\npermit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least\nfor the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and\nparticularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so\nprofitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way –\nthis despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the\nsale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer\nto Rose, 27 March 1928).\n\nGrosset & Dunlap published a reprint edition of *Jurgen* in its Novels\nof Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in\npublishing *Jurgen* in the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker,\nMcBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed\nwhen the Grosset & Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months\nlater, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we\ncan get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset &\nDunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset & Dunlap wrote\nMcBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t\ndirectly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset & Dunlap to McBride\n& Co., 16 November 1933).\n\n#### 271b.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1903. New bibliographical\nedition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran & Co.,\n1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML\nedition (pp. \\[v\\]–403) printed from offset plates photographically\nreduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934. *WR* 25 August\n1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n31 December 1940.\n\nRobert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary,\nwas inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris in *Saturday Review\nof Literature* (27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML\n(de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML\nedition of Norris’s *McTeague* or *The* *Octopus* three years earlier\n(Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff\nsent copies of *The Pit* and *McTeague* for his consideration. He noted\nthat *The Pit* had sold 189,455 copies in all editions while *McTeague*\nhad sold 67,272 copies and *The Octopus* had sold 59,779 copies (de\nGraff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided that *The Pit*\n“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July\n1933). He appears to have been unaware that *McTeague* (57) was in the\nML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni\n& Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.\n\nThe plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition of *The Pit* were too large for\nthe ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would\nhave to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would\nshare the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think,\nmaking some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.).\nMeanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original\nplates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the\nModern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios\nin small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty\nbad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you\nthink, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent\nlooking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing\nCo., 29 August 1933).\n\nPublication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed\nuntil August; Dickens’s *David Copperfield* (269), originally scheduled\nfor August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production of\n*The Pit* appears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end\nof April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to\nuse” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was\nmade to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928\nArgonaut edition. *The Pit* appears to have been the first ML title\nprinted by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive\nthan letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but\nit would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and\nmake new letterpress plates.\n\nSales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing. *The Pit* was\ndiscontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first\nML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on\nthe endpaper.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nNorris, *McTeague* (1918–1922) 57\n\n### 273\n\n**F.

It is by all odds Scott\n> Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the\n> development of American literature can afford to overlook. (*Fall\n> 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xiii\\]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.\n*WR* 29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nMaxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to\nannounce the forthcoming publication of *Tender Is the Night*, which\nappeared initially as a serial in *Scribner’s Magazine*, and added: “If\nit goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why\ndon’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by\nGertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter of *The Great Gatsby* and\nwrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it\nhad brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was\n“creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see\nTanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted\nto publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald\n$50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934).\nIncluding his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300\nfrom the ML edition.\n\nFitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our\nseries” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf\nabout the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off\nwriting it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of\nthe approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week.\nHe appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs\nof the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the\ncorrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the\nintroduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).\n\nThe ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original\nintroductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni & Liveright\nera, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction to *South\nWind* (114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition of *Mrs.\nDalloway* (168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of\nthis genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction to *The Great Gatsby* was one of\nthe worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future\nprintings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like\nthe preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and\nincoherance \\[*sic*\\], two qualities which the story that succeeds it\nmanages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to\nreassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to\nFitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared,\n“The preface *is* incoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but\nsimply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).\n\nA 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is\ninscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in\nTryon \\[North Carolina\\]” with the additional annotation at the top of\np. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington,\nLondon; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the\nML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of\nMaxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s\nown hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv\n&lt;modlib@thuban.owu.edu&gt;, 10 November 2011).\n\n*Tender Is the Night*, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published\nin April 1934, five months before the ML edition of *The Great Gatsby*.\nBy 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent\nCerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition of *Tender Is\nthe Night* if he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now\nare essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the\ncorrespondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the\npreceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he\nwrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity\n. . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than\none in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads\nthem to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to\nCerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell\nPerkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishing *This Side of Paradise,*\n*The Great Gatsby*, and *Tender Is the Night* as an omnibus volume in\nthe ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli, *Some Sort of Epic\nGrandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald*, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).\n\nSales of *The Great Gatsby* were disappointing. The ML edition sold\nabout 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral\nHistory, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal\nenthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest\nsellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott\nFitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s,\n31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By\nthe early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition of *The Great Gatsby* was\nselling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).\n\nThere was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 after *The Great\nGatsby* was discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are\nstamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as\nremainders.\n\n.\n\n### 274\n\n**THORSTEIN VEBLEN.

In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon\nPhelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to\nall of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we\ncould sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell\nthemselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML\npaid Macmillan a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was\npresident of the Macmillan Co. of Canada.\n\nThe ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used\nfor Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some\narrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML\nedition in that format (David Mason, Fine & Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN;\nundated.)\n\n*Maria Chapdelaine* sold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title.

  "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1934",
  "year": "1934",
  "general": "Cerf and Klopfer published the first authorized American edition of\nJames Joyce’s *Ulysses* in January 1934. The book appeared under the\nRandom House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The\nModern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of\nthe firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back\ncopies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and\nCompany, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate\nSylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and\ntourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at\ncustoms.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell\n*Ulysses* before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of\nthe Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the\nwork bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to\nbe seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court,\nSouthern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and\nattorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random\nHouse. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized\nthe literary stature of *Ulysses* and concluded that “nowhere does it\ntend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into\nthe United States was overturned.\n\nThe Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey’s decision, a foreword\nby Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at\n$3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH\nedition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over\n$30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). *Ulysses* (G50) was\nadded to ML Giants in 1940.\n\nOther trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint\nincluded a four-volume edition of Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*,\nGertrude Stein’s *Four Saints in Three Acts*, volumes of poetry by W. H.\nAuden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play\n*Merrily We Roll Along*, and William Saroyan’s *Daring Young Man on the\nFlying Trapeze*.\n\n**Printing technologies: letterpress and offset lithography**\n\nAll ML books before 1934 appear to have been printed from letterpress\nplates. Letterpress is a relief technology. The printing surface is\nraised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal,\nLinotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which\nis cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface\nis inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates\ncast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the\nnineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than\none printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of\nstanding type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was\na metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each\npage allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways,\ndepending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or\nthirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early\n1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was\nlikely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus\nsaving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher\nanticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The\nML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings.\nAll ML books were printed from plates.\n\nWhen the ML reprinted copyrighted works it tried whenever possible to\nuse the original publisher’s letterpress plates or duplicates of the\noriginal plates. The original plates were usually designed for a\nfull-sized trade edition, not the ML’s compact format. This explains why\nmany ML books printed from the original publisher’s plates had\nuncomfortably narrow margins. In some cases the only way the ML could\nprint from the original publisher’s plates was to cut off the running\nheads, as it did with Anatole France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163). The\nintroduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 enhanced the appearance\nof ML books and made it easier to print from original publishers’\nplates.\n\nOffset lithography is a planographic technology where the printing area\nof a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed\ninto the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and\netching). A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is\nbased on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a\nlithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink;\nnon-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink.\nOffset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to\nbe printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a\npreviously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed\nfrom metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of\nletterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed\nsheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the\nnumber of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives\nare placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The\nplate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts\ndifferently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the\nprinting and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing\npossible” (Marshall Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2d ed., 1979, p. 132).\nLetterpress printing typically involves a separate plate for each page;\noffset plates typically print an entire side of a sheet at a time.\nModern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates\nfor each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant\nprinting methodology, some printers appear to have stored the\nlithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates\nwere stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic\nprinting were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not\nuntil the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by\nthis method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a\nmajor book-printing industry” (p. 136).\n\nUnlike relief plates, lithographic plates are lightweight and flexible.\nThey are attached to one cylinder of the printing press. The plate is\ntreated so that the printing areas accept greasy printer’s ink and repel\nwater. In the press, the plate is coated with a thin film of water,\nwhich prevents ink from adhering to non-printing areas; another roller\napplies printer’s ink which adheres to the images to be printed.\n\nLithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or\n“offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed\ndirectly to paper. The inked image is “offset” to a second cylinder\ncovered with a rubber blanket which in turn transfers the image to paper\ncarried by a third cylinder. Lee indicates in *Bookmaking: The\nIllustrated Guide to Design/Production/Editing* (2nd ed., 1979),\n“Several advantages are gained by printing on a rubber blanket first\ninstead of directly on paper: (a) the plates last longer, (b) less water\ncomes in contact with the paper, (c) the resilient rubber cylinder\npermits printing finer copy on rougher paper, and (d) the speed is\nincreased” (p. 137).\n\nSince letterpress printing transfers ink directly from relief plates or\nstanding type to paper, the type surface is wrong reading so that the\nprinted image will be right reading. The extra step in offset\nlithography means that lithographic plates are right reading and can be\nread in the same way that a printed page is read. The inked image on the\noffset cylinder is wrong reading, and the image transferred to paper is\nright reading.\n\nThe ML occasionally resorted to offset lithography before the 1960s when\nthe original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the ML’s\nformat. At that period offset lithography was more expensive than\nletterpress printing and the quality was considered to be inferior, but\nit allowed the ML to avoid the cost of a new typesetting. The ML could\nphotograph the pages of a printed book, reduce the dimensions of the\ntype page photographically, and make offset plates from the negatives.\n\nThe first ML book printed by offset lithography appears to have been\nFrank Norris’s *The Pit* (272), published in August 1934. Parkway\nPrinting Co., the ML’s regular printers, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955, and the ML had the book printed by Polygraphic\nPrinting Co. of America, a New York shop that specialized in offset\nlithography. Other ML titles printed from offset lithographic plates\nbefore the mid-1960s include Newton, *Amenities of Book Collecting*\n(1935: 287), Malraux, *Man’s Fate* (1936: 294), Whitman, *Leaves of\nGrass* (1940: G48), Bemelmans, *My War with the United States* (1941:\n343), and Thurber, *The Thurber Carnival* (1957: 496). The introduction\nof the ML’s larger format in 1939 allowed later printings of *Man’s\nFate* to be made from the original publisher’s letterpress plates.\n*Man’s Fate* was the only ML title printed in succession from offset\nplates, letterpress plates, and then again from offset plates when the\nML switched to offset lithographic printing for most of its titles in\nthe mid 1960s.\n\nThe cost of printing by offset lithography dropped below that of\nletterpress printing around 1963. Over the next few years the ML\nconverted most of its books to offset. Today nearly all commercially\npublished books are printed by offset lithography, and letterpress\nprinting is largely confined to small presses that print books in\nlimited editions from handset type.\n\nSeveral ML books published in the “reissue” format in the 1980s reverted\nto letterpress printing, presumably to capture price breaks for using\nidle letterpress equipment after most book publishers had switched to\noffset lithography. Some of these were printed from letterpress plates\nthat were worn and battered from decades of use; the appearance of these\nbooks is distinctly inferior to those printed from offset plates. When\nthe ML switched to offset printing in the mid-1960s, it tried to\nphotograph first ML printings or the earliest printings it could find in\norder to avoid worn type.",
  "numberOfTitles": "Thirteen new titles were added and twelve were discontinued, bringing\nthe number of titles in the regular ML to 212. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants; by the end of 1934 the Giants included sixteen\ntitles in seventeen volumes.",

An\nenlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The\ncentral panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the\nsurrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to\nfill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll but two 1934 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Veblen, *Theory of the Leisure Class* (274) and\nVirgil, *Works* (277) were published in individually designed\nnon-pictorial jackets.",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf made another attempt to secure James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* for\nthe ML (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 19 March 1934). Six years\nearlier Macmillan had turned down an advance of $4,000 against royalties\nof 12 cents a copy—more than the ML paid for all but a select handful of\ntitles. *The Crock of Gold* was still selling too well in its original\nAmerican edition for Macmillan to consider a reprint. It never appeared\nin the ML.\n\nLittle, Brown turned down an offer by Cerf to reprint *Mutiny on the\nBounty* by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Alfred R. McIntyre of\nLittle, Brown indicated that he doubted if anyone would be allowed to\npublish an inexpensive reprint of the book (Cerf to McIntyre, 20 July\n1934; McIntyre to Cerf, 23 July 1934). Cerf was undeterred and made\noffers for the *Bounty* trilogy.\n\nCerf was also beginning to think about a book on Judaism. He wrote to\nArnold Zweig soliciting his suggestions for the series and indicated,\n“In particular, I would like to do some history of the Jews in the\nModern Library. Have you any suggestions along this line?” (Cerf to\nZweig, 24 July 1934). He repeated his interest two years later in a\nletter to Harold Guinzburg of Viking Press (Cerf to Guinzburg, 3 March\n1936). It took twenty years for this goal to be accomplished. Two books\non Judaism compiled for Random House, *The Wisdom of Israel*, edited by\nLewis Browne (1945) and *Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People*,\nedited by Leo W. Schwarz (1956) were reprinted in ML Giants in 1956 and\n1962.\n\nDale Warren of Houghton Mifflin Co. suggested a ML edition of Dorothy\nRichardson’s *Pilgrimage*, the lengthy novel sequence published in the\nU.S. by Alfred A. Knopf. He noted that “the whole stream of\nconsciousness business was really started by Dorothy Richardson” and\nadded, “I should think you could buy the rights for a song, and get some\nsale—although you would of course be making one of those superb gestures\nfor which the Cerf-Klopfer twins are justly noted” (Warren to Cerf, 30\nJanuary 1934). Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when\nhe was in Boston in September. “My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin\nhave a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are\ntrying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like\nourselves” (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934).\n\nAaron Sussman of Spier & Sussman, the ML’s advertising agency, suggested\na complete edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes’s *Breakfast Papers*\n(Sussman to Cerf, 14 November 1934). Cerf replied, “We steered clear of\nHolmes and his pals as far as the Modern Library is concerned because\nwe’ve had such rotten luck with Franklin and Longfellow volumes.

Discontinued fall 1970.\n\nThe ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major\nbest-seller like *The Good Earth*, which headed the best-seller list for\ntwo years (1931–32). Grosset & Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher\nof hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap\nbetween its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint\nrights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933\nabout a ML edition of *The Good Earth*, he was told that it would be\nmany months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf\nto Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January\n1933). Arrangements were made later that year for *The Good Earth* to\nappear first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and\nshortly thereafter in the ML.\n\nBuck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long\nletter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies\nto Her Chinese Critic” in the *New York Times Book Review* (15 January\n1933).\n\nThree months after Pocket Books published *The Good Earth* as a\ntwenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this\nbook holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many\nother editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our\nModern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative\nsales figures for the Grosset & Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for\nthe eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following:\nGrosset & Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH\nbox 141, folder D1).\n\nSales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War,\nreflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced\ninterest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n*The Good Earth* was shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML\npublished its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.\n\nThe ML’s reprint contract for *The Good Earth* was terminated in July\n1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies.\nTogether with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML\nstock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.\n\n#### 266.1b.

Discontinued fall\n1949.\n\nHammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people\nwho served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had\nno original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the\nprivate detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite\na few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your\nprivate detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my\ncolleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes\nmanner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of\nhimself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in\ncontact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp.\nviii–ix).\n\n*The Maltese Falcon* was originally published as a five-part serial\n(September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazine *Black Mask*. “The\nbook was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two\nthousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the\nchanges were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to\nhave been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).\n\nThere were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and\nfifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (*The Maltese\nFalcon*, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title\npage verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first\nin the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been\nexamined.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version\nstarring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period.\nThe 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears\nto have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued\nin 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph\nC. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950). The ML remaindered 4,774 copies through\nthe Harlem Book Co in 1952.\n\n#### 267b.

Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of *God’s\n> Little Acre* on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and\n> women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin\n> Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case,\n> declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.”\n> The Modern Library now adds *God’s Little Acre* to its list as a\n> serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp.\n\\[v\\], \\[1\\]–\\[311\\]) printed from Viking plates, which were\nsubsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown & Co.\nPublished April 1934. *WR* 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1970/71.\n\nCaldwell received $50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf\nto Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:\n\n> Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have\n> the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have\n> mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly\n> trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and\n> girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee\n> winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills\n> of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them.\n> I hope so. (p. ix)\n\nThe hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition\nwas realized most fully after the introduction of mass market\npaperbacks. The paperback edition of *God’s Little Acre*, published in\n1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by\nPenguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its\nfirst nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern\npaperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million\ncopies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).\n\nThe biographical note and bibliography on p. \\[vi\\] were updated at\nCaldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27\nDecember 1938). The plates and publishing rights to *God’s Little Acre*\nwere transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall\n1939 and passed to Little, Brown & Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged\nits printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one\nprinting under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted\nthat the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934\nand inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill,\nLittle, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying\nroyalties of 12 cents a copy.\n\nThe ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total\nsales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to\nJames Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).\n\n#### 268.1b.

Discontinued fall 1943.\n\n*Jurgen* was one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure\nafter they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a\n$5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice\nhe offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’s *Cream of the Jest* or\n*The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck* (Cerf to Mr. \\[Guy\\] Holt, McBride, 29\nJuly 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition of *Beyond Life* (104)\ntwo years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint\neditions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained\nstrong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition\nof Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).\n\nMcBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* (131) in\n1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer for *Jurgen*, but\nthe response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12\ncents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to\npermit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least\nfor the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and\nparticularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so\nprofitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way –\nthis despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the\nsale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer\nto Rose, 27 March 1928).\n\nGrosset & Dunlap published a reprint edition of *Jurgen* in its Novels\nof Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in\npublishing *Jurgen* in the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker,\nMcBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed\nwhen the Grosset & Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months\nlater, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we\ncan get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset &\nDunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset & Dunlap wrote\nMcBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t\ndirectly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset & Dunlap to McBride\n& Co., 16 November 1933).\n\n#### 271b.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1903. New bibliographical\nedition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran & Co.,\n1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML\nedition (pp. \\[v\\]–403) printed from offset plates photographically\nreduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934. *WR* 25 August\n1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n31 December 1940.\n\nRobert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary,\nwas inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris in *Saturday Review\nof Literature* (27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML\n(de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML\nedition of Norris’s *McTeague* or *The* *Octopus* three years earlier\n(Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff\nsent copies of *The Pit* and *McTeague* for his consideration. He noted\nthat *The Pit* had sold 189,455 copies in all editions while *McTeague*\nhad sold 67,272 copies and *The Octopus* had sold 59,779 copies (de\nGraff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided that *The Pit*\n“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July\n1933). He appears to have been unaware that *McTeague* (57) was in the\nML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni\n& Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.\n\nThe plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition of *The Pit* were too large for\nthe ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would\nhave to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would\nshare the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think,\nmaking some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.).\nMeanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original\nplates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the\nModern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios\nin small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty\nbad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you\nthink, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent\nlooking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing\nCo., 29 August 1933).\n\nPublication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed\nuntil August; Dickens’s *David Copperfield* (269), originally scheduled\nfor August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production of\n*The Pit* appears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end\nof April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to\nuse” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was\nmade to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928\nArgonaut edition. *The Pit* appears to have been the first ML title\nprinted by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive\nthan letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but\nit would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and\nmake new letterpress plates.\n\nSales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing. *The Pit* was\ndiscontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first\nML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on\nthe endpaper.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nNorris, *McTeague* (1918–1922) 57"

(*Fall\n> 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xiii\\]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.\n*WR* 29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nMaxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to\nannounce the forthcoming publication of *Tender Is the Night*, which\nappeared initially as a serial in *Scribner’s Magazine*, and added: “If\nit goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why\ndon’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by\nGertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter of *The Great Gatsby* and\nwrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it\nhad brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was\n“creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see\nTanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted\nto publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald\n$50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934).\nIncluding his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300\nfrom the ML edition.\n\nFitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our\nseries” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf\nabout the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off\nwriting it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of\nthe approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week.\nHe appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs\nof the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the\ncorrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the\nintroduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).\n\nThe ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original\nintroductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni & Liveright\nera, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction to *South\nWind* (114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition of *Mrs.\nDalloway* (168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of\nthis genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction to *The Great Gatsby* was one of\nthe worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future\nprintings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like\nthe preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and\nincoherance \\[*sic*\\], two qualities which the story that succeeds it\nmanages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to\nreassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to\nFitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared,\n“The preface *is* incoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but\nsimply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).\n\nA 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is\ninscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in\nTryon \\[North Carolina\\]” with the additional annotation at the top of\np. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington,\nLondon; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the\nML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of\nMaxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s\nown hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv\n&lt;modlib@thuban.owu.edu&gt;, 10 November 2011).\n\n*Tender Is the Night*, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published\nin April 1934, five months before the ML edition of *The Great Gatsby*.\nBy 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent\nCerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition of *Tender Is\nthe Night* if he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now\nare essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the\ncorrespondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the\npreceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he\nwrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity\n. . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than\none in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads\nthem to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to\nCerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell\nPerkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishing *This Side of Paradise,*\n*The Great Gatsby*, and *Tender Is the Night* as an omnibus volume in\nthe ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli, *Some Sort of Epic\nGrandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald*, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).\n\nSales of *The Great Gatsby* were disappointing. The ML edition sold\nabout 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral\nHistory, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal\nenthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest\nsellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott\nFitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s,\n31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By\nthe early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition of *The Great Gatsby* was\nselling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).\n\nThere was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 after *The Great\nGatsby* was discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are\nstamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as\nremainders.\n\n."

In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon\nPhelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to\nall of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we\ncould sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell\nthemselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML\npaid Macmillan a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was\npresident of the Macmillan Co. of Canada.\n\nThe ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used\nfor Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some\narrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML\nedition in that format (David Mason, Fine & Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN;\nundated.)\n\n*Maria Chapdelaine* sold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1934 1934 Cerf and Klopfer published the first authorized American edition of\nJames Joyce’s *Ulysses* in January 1934. The book appeared under the\nRandom House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The\nModern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of\nthe firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back\ncopies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and\nCompany, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate\nSylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and\ntourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at\ncustoms.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell\n*Ulysses* before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of\nthe Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the\nwork bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to\nbe seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court,\nSouthern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and\nattorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random\nHouse. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized\nthe literary stature of *Ulysses* and concluded that “nowhere does it\ntend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into\nthe United States was overturned.\n\nThe Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey’s decision, a foreword\nby Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at\n$3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH\nedition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over\n$30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). *Ulysses* (G50) was\nadded to ML Giants in 1940.\n\nOther trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint\nincluded a four-volume edition of Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*,\nGertrude Stein’s *Four Saints in Three Acts*, volumes of poetry by W. H.\nAuden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play\n*Merrily We Roll Along*, and William Saroyan’s *Daring Young Man on the\nFlying Trapeze*.\n\n**Printing technologies: letterpress and offset lithography**\n\nAll ML books before 1934 appear to have been printed from letterpress\nplates. Letterpress is a relief technology. The printing surface is\nraised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal,\nLinotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which\nis cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface\nis inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates\ncast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the\nnineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than\none printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of\nstanding type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was\na metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each\npage allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways,\ndepending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or\nthirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early\n1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was\nlikely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus\nsaving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher\nanticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The\nML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings.\nAll ML books were printed from plates.\n\nWhen the ML reprinted copyrighted works it tried whenever possible to\nuse the original publisher’s letterpress plates or duplicates of the\noriginal plates. The original plates were usually designed for a\nfull-sized trade edition, not the ML’s compact format. This explains why\nmany ML books printed from the original publisher’s plates had\nuncomfortably narrow margins. In some cases the only way the ML could\nprint from the original publisher’s plates was to cut off the running\nheads, as it did with Anatole France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163). The\nintroduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 enhanced the appearance\nof ML books and made it easier to print from original publishers’\nplates.\n\nOffset lithography is a planographic technology where the printing area\nof a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed\ninto the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and\netching). A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is\nbased on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a\nlithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink;\nnon-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink.\nOffset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to\nbe printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a\npreviously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed\nfrom metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of\nletterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed\nsheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the\nnumber of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives\nare placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The\nplate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts\ndifferently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the\nprinting and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing\npossible” (Marshall Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2d ed., 1979, p. 132).\nLetterpress printing typically involves a separate plate for each page;\noffset plates typically print an entire side of a sheet at a time.\nModern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates\nfor each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant\nprinting methodology, some printers appear to have stored the\nlithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates\nwere stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic\nprinting were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not\nuntil the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by\nthis method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a\nmajor book-printing industry” (p. 136).\n\nUnlike relief plates, lithographic plates are lightweight and flexible.\nThey are attached to one cylinder of the printing press. The plate is\ntreated so that the printing areas accept greasy printer’s ink and repel\nwater. In the press, the plate is coated with a thin film of water,\nwhich prevents ink from adhering to non-printing areas; another roller\napplies printer’s ink which adheres to the images to be printed.\n\nLithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or\n“offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed\ndirectly to paper. The inked image is “offset” to a second cylinder\ncovered with a rubber blanket which in turn transfers the image to paper\ncarried by a third cylinder. Lee indicates in *Bookmaking: The\nIllustrated Guide to Design/Production/Editing* (2nd ed., 1979),\n“Several advantages are gained by printing on a rubber blanket first\ninstead of directly on paper: (a) the plates last longer, (b) less water\ncomes in contact with the paper, (c) the resilient rubber cylinder\npermits printing finer copy on rougher paper, and (d) the speed is\nincreased” (p. 137).\n\nSince letterpress printing transfers ink directly from relief plates or\nstanding type to paper, the type surface is wrong reading so that the\nprinted image will be right reading. The extra step in offset\nlithography means that lithographic plates are right reading and can be\nread in the same way that a printed page is read. The inked image on the\noffset cylinder is wrong reading, and the image transferred to paper is\nright reading.\n\nThe ML occasionally resorted to offset lithography before the 1960s when\nthe original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the ML’s\nformat. At that period offset lithography was more expensive than\nletterpress printing and the quality was considered to be inferior, but\nit allowed the ML to avoid the cost of a new typesetting. The ML could\nphotograph the pages of a printed book, reduce the dimensions of the\ntype page photographically, and make offset plates from the negatives.\n\nThe first ML book printed by offset lithography appears to have been\nFrank Norris’s *The Pit* (272), published in August 1934. Parkway\nPrinting Co., the ML’s regular printers, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955, and the ML had the book printed by Polygraphic\nPrinting Co. of America, a New York shop that specialized in offset\nlithography. Other ML titles printed from offset lithographic plates\nbefore the mid-1960s include Newton, *Amenities of Book Collecting*\n(1935: 287), Malraux, *Man’s Fate* (1936: 294), Whitman, *Leaves of\nGrass* (1940: G48), Bemelmans, *My War with the United States* (1941:\n343), and Thurber, *The Thurber Carnival* (1957: 496). The introduction\nof the ML’s larger format in 1939 allowed later printings of *Man’s\nFate* to be made from the original publisher’s letterpress plates.\n*Man’s Fate* was the only ML title printed in succession from offset\nplates, letterpress plates, and then again from offset plates when the\nML switched to offset lithographic printing for most of its titles in\nthe mid 1960s.\n\nThe cost of printing by offset lithography dropped below that of\nletterpress printing around 1963. Over the next few years the ML\nconverted most of its books to offset. Today nearly all commercially\npublished books are printed by offset lithography, and letterpress\nprinting is largely confined to small presses that print books in\nlimited editions from handset type.\n\nSeveral ML books published in the “reissue” format in the 1980s reverted\nto letterpress printing, presumably to capture price breaks for using\nidle letterpress equipment after most book publishers had switched to\noffset lithography. Some of these were printed from letterpress plates\nthat were worn and battered from decades of use; the appearance of these\nbooks is distinctly inferior to those printed from offset plates. When\nthe ML switched to offset printing in the mid-1960s, it tried to\nphotograph first ML printings or the earliest printings it could find in\norder to avoid worn type. Thirteen new titles were added and twelve were discontinued, bringing\nthe number of titles in the regular ML to 212. Five new titles were\npublished in ML Giants; by the end of 1934 the Giants included sixteen\ntitles in seventeen volumes. All new titles were published in the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format in\nballoon cloth binding D with the Kent endpaper in orange. Each title was\navailable in red, blue, green, and brown cloth with the top edge stained\nthe same color as the binding. All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and torchbearer A2. All new titles had the\n3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe title pages of two fall 1934 titles, Veblen, *Theory of the Leisure\nClass* (274) and Heyward, *Porgy* (275), omitted spaces between the\nletters in the second line of the imprint:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nTHE MODERN LIBRARY\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold\nabove the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued\nto be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each\ntitle published simultaneously in all four bindings. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World*\n(1935) and three spring 1939 titles, all of which were published in the\nlarger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning fall 1939. An\nenlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The\ncentral panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the\nsurrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to\nfill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll but two 1934 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Veblen, *Theory of the Leisure Class* (274) and\nVirgil, *Works* (277) were published in individually designed\nnon-pictorial jackets. 95 cents. (Spring) Caldwell, *God’s Little Acre* xHeyward, *Porgy*; Giants through\nG14; jackets: 225 (=fall 1933, fall 1934). (Fall) Heyward, *Porgy*\nxHamsun, *Growth of the Soil*; Giants through G17; jackets: 225 (=fall\n1933, spring 1934). *Note:* Titles scheduled for January publication\nwere printed late in the preceding year; ML lists inside the jackets and\nat the end of the volumes are typically those of the preceding fall. Cerf made another attempt to secure James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* for\nthe ML (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 19 March 1934). Six years\nearlier Macmillan had turned down an advance of $4,000 against royalties\nof 12 cents a copy—more than the ML paid for all but a select handful of\ntitles. *The Crock of Gold* was still selling too well in its original\nAmerican edition for Macmillan to consider a reprint. It never appeared\nin the ML.\n\nLittle, Brown turned down an offer by Cerf to reprint *Mutiny on the\nBounty* by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Alfred R. McIntyre of\nLittle, Brown indicated that he doubted if anyone would be allowed to\npublish an inexpensive reprint of the book (Cerf to McIntyre, 20 July\n1934; McIntyre to Cerf, 23 July 1934). Cerf was undeterred and made\noffers for the *Bounty* trilogy.\n\nCerf was also beginning to think about a book on Judaism. He wrote to\nArnold Zweig soliciting his suggestions for the series and indicated,\n“In particular, I would like to do some history of the Jews in the\nModern Library. Have you any suggestions along this line?” (Cerf to\nZweig, 24 July 1934). He repeated his interest two years later in a\nletter to Harold Guinzburg of Viking Press (Cerf to Guinzburg, 3 March\n1936). It took twenty years for this goal to be accomplished. Two books\non Judaism compiled for Random House, *The Wisdom of Israel*, edited by\nLewis Browne (1945) and *Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People*,\nedited by Leo W. Schwarz (1956) were reprinted in ML Giants in 1956 and\n1962.\n\nDale Warren of Houghton Mifflin Co. suggested a ML edition of Dorothy\nRichardson’s *Pilgrimage*, the lengthy novel sequence published in the\nU.S. by Alfred A. Knopf. He noted that “the whole stream of\nconsciousness business was really started by Dorothy Richardson” and\nadded, “I should think you could buy the rights for a song, and get some\nsale—although you would of course be making one of those superb gestures\nfor which the Cerf-Klopfer twins are justly noted” (Warren to Cerf, 30\nJanuary 1934). Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when\nhe was in Boston in September. “My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin\nhave a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are\ntrying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like\nourselves” (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934).\n\nAaron Sussman of Spier & Sussman, the ML’s advertising agency, suggested\na complete edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes’s *Breakfast Papers*\n(Sussman to Cerf, 14 November 1934). Cerf replied, “We steered clear of\nHolmes and his pals as far as the Modern Library is concerned because\nwe’ve had such rotten luck with Franklin and Longfellow volumes. It\nmakes me believe that people who want this sort of thing are not\ninclined to look for it in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Sussman, 15\nNovember 1934). Sales of *The Poems of Longfellow* (235) and *The\nAutobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other\nWritings* (236) improved in the 1940s and 1950s, when Longfellow ranked\nin the first quarter of ML and Giant titles and Franklin ranked in the\nsecond quarter.

The book appeared under the\nRandom House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The\nModern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of\nthe firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back\ncopies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and\nCompany, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate\nSylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and\ntourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at\ncustoms.
