    "With virtually the entire world at war, Stephen Crane’s masterpiece becomes even more timely than it ever has been. Its unforgettable story of the individual soldier in the stress of actual battle has never been surpassed, and its truth and reality are just as gripping under the conditions of aerial and tank warfare today as they were under the circumstances of musket and cavalry charges of the Civil War.The Red Badge of Courageis a notable addition to the Modern Library series because of all war books it remains through the years one of the most permanent. (Spring 1942)",

    "Cerf tried to secure reprint rights toThe Red Badge of Courageas early as 1928, when he offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928), but Appleton refused to grant permission. The copyright status of the novel was unclear. Alfred A. Knopf had included it in a 12-volume limited edition of Crane’s works published in 1925. In the early 1930s, when Knopf was considering including it in an omnibus edition of Crane’s works, his lawyers concluded that it was in the public domain. Cerf told Knopf that he planned to offer Appleton a $600 advance against royalties of 6 cents a copy and would probably publish it in the ML without permission if Appleton rejected the offer (Cerf to Knopf, 2 December 1932). Neither Knopf nor Cerf went ahead with their plans.When the ML publishedThe Red Badge of Courageten years later it was by arrangement with Appleton-Century and printed from Appleton plates. The ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy.",
    "The ML edition sold 5,660 copies during the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML titles. The release of John Huston’s film version in 1951 appears to have boosted sales. The ML edition sold 7,418 copies between November 1951 and October 1952, makingThe Red Badge of Couragethe19th best-selling title in the series.",

    "Stallman received $200 for his introduction and editorial work on the volume (Stein to Stallman, 26 June 1950). Stein, who edited Modern Library College Editions, wanted to add several stories by Crane to the volume, in part because he thought it might forestall Rinehart & Co. from bringing out a competing edition in their paperback series for the college market (Stein to Stallman, 11 July 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 28 August 1950). Stallman suggested “Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,” “The Open Boat,” “An Episode of War,” “The Upturned Face,” and “A Mystery of Heroism.” Stein hoped to secure permission to include the stories for a flat fee, but Knopf insisted on a royalty. Appleton-Century-Crofts was charging a 2-cent royalty for the use of their plates for MLCE printings. Adding the stories would have increased the royalty for MLCE printings to 4 cents a copy and also added to the cost of the regular ML edition. Haas indicated that this was too much, and plans to include the stories were abandoned (Haas to Stein, 30 August 1950).",

    "Stephen Crane wrote about war with all the compassion and poetry of a great artist. He was the first American writer to depict the horrors of war, the ambiguities of courage, and the absence of heroic illusions among soldiers. In addition,The Red Badge of Courageis a brilliantly structured work that illuminates the nature of the artistic imagination: Stephen Crane did not experience the war first hand, but through the powers of empathy and projection he has given us an unparalleled and unforgettable picture of the Civil War stripped of romantic glorification.",
