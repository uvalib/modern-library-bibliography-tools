    "Among philosophers Santayana has earned the tribute of being considered the dramatist of ideas. His many-faceted wisdom, the vast range of his intellectual curiosity and the graceful flow of his style explain why he is one of the most widely read poet–philosophers of modern times. The best and most characteristic of Santayana’s writings in prose and verse are assembled in this volume of 650 pages. Irwin Edman, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, who is responsible for the selection, contributes a brilliant Introductory Essay. (Spring 1942)",
    "Originally published with Edman’s introductory essay by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for November 1942 but published in September.WR26 September 1942. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1952.",
    "Cerf expressed interest inThe Philosophy of Santayanain 1939, but Scribner’s does not appear to have been ready to authorize an inexpensive reprint (Whitney Darrow to Cerf, 17 July 1939). Three years later the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of $1,000 against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased to 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available and in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format. Scribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to recover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman edited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional payment for the ML edition.",
    "The suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came initially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had editedThe Philosophy of William James(119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former student of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James volume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar collection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the volume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was interested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than $250 (Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926). Cerf told him to go ahead, then wrote three months later to cancel the project, noting that he wanted the book but was afraid that Scribner’s would not give the necessary permissions (Cerf to Kallen, 29 November 1926; Cerf to Kallen, 3 March 1927). That summer Cerf indicated to Joseph Ratner, who had written on Santayana’s behalf to inquire about progress on the project, that the collection was out of the question for the time being because of the large number of permissions that would have to be secured from Scribner’s. “We are convinced that just as soon as we approached them on the subject they would turn us down and proceed on such an anthology on their own . . .” (Ratner to Cerf, 8 June 1927; Cerf to Ratner, 11 August 1927). Scribner’s publishedThe Philosophy of Santayanain 1939.",
    "The ML edition sold 7,405 copies by 1 November 1943. Scribner’s published a new and greatly enlarged edition ofThe Philosophy of Santayanain 1953 and may have terminated the ML’s reprint contract in anticipation of the appearance of that edition.",
