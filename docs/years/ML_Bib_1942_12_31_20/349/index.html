    "The literary sensation of 1940 was Richard Wright’s novel,Native Son. Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and profound in its understanding, this story of crime and punishment belongs to no season; it has established a permanent place for itself among the unquestionably important books of our time. Far more than a social document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by whites, it is the story of a hunted human being doomed by forces within and outside himself to be what he is until his very last breath. (Spring 1942)",

    "The publication, in 1940, of Richard Wright’s first novel,Native Son, was hailed with high critical praise and with enthusiasm by general readers. But this story of crime and punishment belongs to no season. Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and scrupulous in its search for understanding of the forces that lead to tragedy, this novel is far more than a social document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by whites. It is the drama of a haunted human being doomed by the tensions within and outside himself to be what he is until his very last breath. (Fall 1954)",
    "Originally published by Harper & Bros., 1940, with an introduction by Dorothy Canfield Fisher. The Harper plates were available to the ML but were too large for its format; the ML edition was printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March 1942.WR14 March 1942. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.",
    "Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition shortly afterNative Sonwas published (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 11 April 1940). Hoyns promised to talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted that Grosset & Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright and for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied that it should be possible for both Grosset & Dunlap and the ML to do the book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on these reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new titles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit of everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940).",
    "The following year Cerf wrote to Wright hoping to secure his support for a ML edition. He indicated that he wanted to publishNative Sonin spring 1942 and invited Wright to write an introduction if a ML edition could be arranged (Cerf to Wright, 12 August 1941). Wright did not reply and Cerf wrote again on 3 September 1941. Wright does not appear to have replied to this letter either. In the end the ML reprinted the Fisher introduction from the Harper edition.",
    "Native Sonsold 7,046 copies during the during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
    "Harper’s informed the ML in 1956 that its College Department wanted to includeNative Sonand Richard Hughes’sHigh Wind in Jamaica(239) in Harper Modern Classics, a clothbound series aimed at the textbook market (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper’s, to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Harper’s was willing to allow both titles to remain in the ML, but Klopfer decided to drop them when the stock on hand was exhausted. “They’re not strong enough titles to hang on in competition with your own cloth-bound edition” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956)."
