Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and profound in its understanding, this story of crime and punishment belongs to no season; it has established a permanent place for itself among the unquestionably important books of our time. Far more than a social document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by whites, it is the story of a hunted human being doomed by forces within and outside himself to be what he is until his very last breath.

But this story of crime and punishment belongs to no season. Overwhelming in its power, compassionate and scrupulous in its search for understanding of the forces that lead to tragedy, this novel is far more than a social document that examines the plight of the Negro in a world dominated by whites. It is the drama of a haunted human being doomed by the tensions within and outside himself to be what he is until his very last breath. (Fall 1954)"

Hoyns promised to talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted that Grosset & Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright and for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied that it should be possible for both Grosset & Dunlap and the ML to do the book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on these reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new titles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit of everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940)."

He indicated that he wanted to publishNative Sonin spring 1942 and invited Wright to write an introduction if a ML edition could be arranged (Cerf to Wright, 12 August 1941). Wright did not reply and Cerf wrote again on 3 September 1941. Wright does not appear to have replied to this letter either. In the end the ML reprinted the Fisher introduction from the Harper edition."

Harper’s was willing to allow both titles to remain in the ML, but Klopfer decided to drop them when the stock on hand was exhausted. “They’re not strong enough titles to hang on in competition with your own cloth-bound edition” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956)."
