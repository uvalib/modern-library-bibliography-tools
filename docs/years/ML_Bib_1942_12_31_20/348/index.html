    "The first American to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, Sinclair Lewis is now represented in the Modern Library series by two of his most memorable novels—Arrowsmith(No. 42) andBabbitt. His portrait of George F. Babbitt, realtor, is so firm in the minds of all English–speaking people that the name has become incorporated into the language as a permanent word. Readers of every language into whichBabbitthas been translated regard it as Sinclair Lewis’s masterpiece and have created from it a conception of an American type of the prosaic but always human business man. (Fall 1941)",
    "Originally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1922. ML edition (pp. [7]–401) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February 1942.WR14 February 1942. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1949.",
    "The first Harcourt, Brace printing, published in September 1922, exists in two states, with the second state containing two corrections on p. 49 (“Lyte” instead of “Purdy” in line 3, “any” instead of “my” in line 5). Three more corrections were made in the second printing, one correction (“for” instead of “against” on p. 392, line 1) was made in the third printing, and eleven more corrections were made in the fourth printing, making the fourth printing “the most authoritative version of the work” (John Hersey, “Note on the Texts,”Main Street & Babbitt[New York: Library of America, 1992], p. 883).",
    "Harcourt, Brace anticipated strong sales and made a duplicate set of plates, probably beforeBabbittwas published. The duplicate plates incorporate the corrections in the second state of the first printing but not those in the second, third, or fourth printings, which were made between October and November 1922. The duplicate plates or shells, which appear to have been made in July 1922, were held in reserve.",
    "When the ML negotiated reprint rights in 1941, Harcourt, Brace melted the original plates, which had become worn, and provided the duplicate plates to the ML for its printings. ML printings, as well as later printings in Harbrace Modern Classics (1950) and other reprint editions, revert to the text of the second state of the first printing, and do not include the corrections made in the second, third, and fourth printings (Matthew J. Bruccoli, “Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis’sBabbitt,”Studies in Bibliography11 (1958): 263–68; available online at http://www.bsuva.org.  For the next fifty years all American printings—including  the paperback edition in Signet Classics (1961)—appear to have omitted the corrections made to the text in the third, fourth, and fifth Harcourt, Brace printings. The corrections were restored in the Library of America edition ofMain Street & Babbitt(1992) but many subsequent editions, such as the Bantam paperback published in 1998, continued to be set from flawed earlier printings.",
    "To secureBabbittCerf agreed to a three-year reprint contract, after which Harcourt, Brace had the right to cancel the contracts for the ML editions of bothBabbittandArrowsmith, with the cancellations to be effective on the same date. He told Harcourt, “I shall be curious to see just how the Pocket Book [mass market paperback] edition of ARROWSMITH affects both your edition and ours of that book!” (Cerf to Hastings Harcourt, 31 July 1941).",
    "Lewis became a RH author in 1939 when he followed his editor Harry Maule from Doubleday to Random House.Arrowsmith(243) had been in the Modern Library since 1933, but Lewis wanted to have more of his books in the series. Maule conveyed the good news thatBabbittwould be added to the series: “Bennett and I thought you might be interested to know that, through some complicated horse-trading, he has finally gotten BABBITT for the Modern Library. I don’t begin to understand the convolutions by which he was able to do this, but he thinks this time it will stick” (Maule to Lewis, 1 August 1941). Lewis was “extremely glad” (Lewis to Maule, 12 August 1941).Dodsworth(348) became his third title in the series in 1947.",
    "The ML edition ofBabbittsold 5,807 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in October 1942 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in March 1943.",
    "When Harcourt, Brace launched its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, for the burgeoning college market in 1948, it served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for all of Lewis’s titles in the ML (Arrowsmith,BabbittandDodsworth) as well as five other Harcourt, Brace titles by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 4,000 copies ofBabbittin stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948). The Harbrace Modern Classics edition ofBabbitt, printed from the same plates used by the ML, was published in 1950.Dodsworthwas reprieved; it was never included in Harbrace Modern Classics and the Modern Library edition remained in print until 1970.",
