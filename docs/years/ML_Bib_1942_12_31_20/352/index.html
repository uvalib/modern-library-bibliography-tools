Signed:McK [McKnight] Kauffer. Front flap: The story of the life of Benjamin Disraeli is the story of the rise of British imperialism and the consolidation of its far-flung empire. For a clearer understanding of the role England has played in the world during the last century one has but to study the career of the Prime Minister who shaped her policy. Certainly no writer of of [sic; second “of” removed by spring 1952] our time has interpreted the man and his period more faithfully or plainly than André Maurois. His book has a special timeliness at the moment of gravest danger to the British Empire. (Spring 1942) Front flap reset with last sentence replaced by following: His book portrays a personality that dominated an order now fading into history, after two world wars and the reign of five monarchs.
