[1–9]8[10]4 [1] half title; [2] blank; [3] title; [4] COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY THE CENTURY COMPANY | FIRSTModern LibraryEDITION, 1942; [5–6] biographical note; 3–147 text; [148] blank. Variant:Pp. [6], 3–147 [148–156].  [1–10]8. Contents as 356.1 except: [149–154] ML list; [155–156] ML Giants list. (Fall 1944) Jacket:Pictorial in deep pink (3), light yellow (86), light yellowish green (135) and black on coated white paper with small inset illustration of Marco Polo holding the hand of the daughter of Kubla Khan at the top of a large black panel with title and other lettering in reverse, framed in deep pink . Unsigned. Front flap: Just as Marco Polo’s own account of his adventures and explorations in the East will always be counted one of the world’s treasures among travel books, so Donn Byrne’s story of the Venetian merchant’s love for the daughter of Kubla Khan is considered one of the world’s most glowing romances. Told with a fiery intensity and with a magical evocation of the splendors of its Oriental background, this love story stirs the imagination. Its appeal is for everyone who has ever dreamed of far places and the excitement of strange encounters. (Spring 1942) Originally published by the Century Co., 1921. ML edition (356.1, pp. 3–147) printed from Appleton-Century plates with fly title and illustrations omitted. Published November 1942.WR2 November 1942. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1958. Cerf expressed interest inMesser Marco Poloas early as 1930, but the Century Co. was not interested in a ML edition at that time (Cerf to Century Co., 26 September 1930; John F. Winters, Century Co., to Cerf, 29 September 1930). When the ML edition finally appeared it sold 6,622 copies in its first year, but interest in Byrne was beginning to wane. AfterMesser Marco Polohad been in the series for four years, Cerf indicated that the sales records showed a steady decline. “Evidently Byrne’s books don’t mean very much to readers of today” (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 9 January 1947). 356.2.  Text reset (1954?) Title as 356.1. Pp. [i–iv] v–vi, [1–2] 3–154.  [1–5]16 [i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY THE CENTURY COMPANY | COPYRIGHT, 1949, BY DOROTHEA CRAIG; v–vi biographical note; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–154 text. Jacket:As 356.1 except flap text reset with last sentence revised: “Its appeal is for everyone who has ever dreamed of far-away and exotic places and longed for the excitement of unfamiliar encounters and new adventures.” (Spring 1954) The reason for resetting the text has not been ascertained. Bannister (p. 42) indicates a 1949 publication date, probably on the basis of the copyright renewal date. All copies examined of 356.2 have spring 1954 jackets, hence the tentative publication date. The latest copy examined of 356.1 contains a spring 1946 list, so the existence of a printing between 1946 and 1954 is possible."
