    "By insistent popular demand, Elliot Paul’s masterpiece,The Life and Death of a Spanish Town, is added to the Modern Library series. The first book to interpret to Americans the struggle of a people whose idyllic life was shattered by Fascist terror, it foreshadowed, with burning indignation against aggressors and outspoken sympathy for the obscure and simple men and women of Santa Eulalia, the alignment of forces all over the world today. Elliot Paul’s reputation rests securely on this book and his more recent national best-seller,The Last Time I Saw Paris. (Fall 1942)",
