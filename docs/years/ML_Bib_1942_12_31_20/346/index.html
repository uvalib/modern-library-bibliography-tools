    "World events are rapidly catching up with the prophecies made by Nostradamus three hundred years ago. Whether his predictions were accidental or based upon an occult foreknowledge, they are frequently uncanny in their accuracy. His book of oracles is having a tremendous vogue at present, partly because of the wide variety of interpretations that can be made from his prognostications, but mainly because it makes fascinating reading when related to the catastrophes announced daily while the world is in crisis. This edition [±volume], edited by Charles A. Ward, gives special emphasis to prophecies of contemporary events and those immediately ahead. (Fall 1941; [Fall 1954])",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Scribner & Welford, 1891; published with Supplement by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1940. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the frontispiece from the 1672 London edition omitted from the Supplement. The 1940 Scribner printing places the Supplement after the index and paginates it separately from the rest of the text; the ML edition places the Supplement before the index. Published February 1942.WR14 February 1942. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "The ML edition ofOracles of Nostradamuswas published two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The decision to include Nostradamus had been made before the United States entered the war. Cerf commented, “We put that title in, possibly with our tongues in our cheeks, because people seem to be interested in predictions of a strange character” (“Of Men and Books: Critic John C. Frederick, guest Bennett Cerf, in a Radio Conversation over the Columbia Broadcasting System,”Northwestern University on the Air2, no. 16 [16 January1943], p. 4).",
    "When the United States declared war on Japan on 8 December 1941 and recognized a state of war with Germany and Italy three days later, the future looked dark and the outcome of the war was uncertain.The Oracles of Nostradamusbecame one of the Modern Library’s best-selling titles. Itsold16,043 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. Only five ML titles—Maugham’sOf Human Bondage(199) and Dostoyevsky’sCrime and Punishment(228) in the regular series, andThe Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud(G37), James T. Farrell’sStuds Lonigan(G39), andThe Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway(G59) in the Giants—sold more copies during this period.",
    "The Oracles of Nostradamusdid not rank among the 100 best-selling regular ML titles in 1951/52.",

    "Front flap:",
    "The oracles of the sixteenth-century astrologer Nostradamus have exerted a great influence over the minds of men in every century since his death, and in times of war, famine, and political upheaval are read with increasing curiosity. The delphic character of the oracles makes it difficult to identify correctly each country and person described—but the disturbing accuracy of the few clearly dated prophecies has given Nostradamus added authority.",
    "The interpretive work of Charles Ward, which makes up the body of this volume, was completed in 1891. To it has been added a supplementary section of oracles, literally translated from the French, and un-interpreted, whose application to the twentieth century again arouses amazement at the uncanny foresight of Europe’s most famous seer."
