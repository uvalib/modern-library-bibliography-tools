    "Front flap:",
    "As more and more we look westward across the Pacific, the writings of James A. Michener take on increased interest and importance as informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux.",
    "The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer, his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia in rebirth.",
    "In this volume are selections fromTales of the South Pacific,Return to Paradise,The Voice of Asia, and the complete text ofThe Bridges at Toko-Ri. (Spring 1957)",
    "Original ML collection selected fromTales of the South Pacific(Macmillan, 1947),Return to Paradise(RH, 1951), andThe Voice of Asia(RH, 1951), with the complete text ofThe Bridges of Toko-ri(RH, 1953). Published April 1957.WR29 April 1957. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.",
    "In the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition of his first book,Tales of the South Pacific, “shows how little the publisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:",
    "One important change has been made in the text here offered, and another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the wordAsiaticwhen used to describe themselves. I have changed this word toAsian. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps even greater fervor the wordChinaman. After my first several books appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I have corrected this offensive word toChinese; but in certain stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).",
    "Michener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication ofTales of the South Pacific. He signed with Random House on 19 April 1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August 2010). His second book,The Fires of Spring, was published by Random House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a 1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old Mansion,”PW, 13 July 1946, p. 174).",
    "Inconsistencies in the capitalization ofThe Bridges at Toko-riare reproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a jacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of Toko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”",
