In the marriage of Judge Timberlane and his very young wife—and indeed in the marriages of the others in the book—there is the basis for brilliant observation and comment by one of America’s foremost novelists. This book will be welcomed not only by those who now read it for the first time, but by those who will enjoy re-reading it for renewed and enlarged insights into our society. (Fall 1957)"
