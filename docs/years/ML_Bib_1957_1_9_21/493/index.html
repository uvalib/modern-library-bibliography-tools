    "Few figures in the history of man have had more to do with the shaping of our present civilization than Julius Caesar. A towering political leader, a military genius, and a skilled writer, he deserves a fate better than that of being a subject of an unwilling schoolboy’s Latin lesson. Those readers who have long forgotten their Latin will find in this book new and sound perspectives on this important man, for there are few books that provide a better, more interesting picture of mankind at a historic crossroad.",
