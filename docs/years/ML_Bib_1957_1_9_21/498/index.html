    "“These notebooks,” says the editor in his Introduction, “are the treatment of a man who sought knowledge as a mystic seeks God; the record of a lifetime of observation and speculation, set down in five thousand manuscript pages . . . containing some of the most brilliant and far-ranging deductions that the mind of man has ever conceived.”",
    "In this volume, the most absorbing and provocative parts of Da Vinci’s notebooks have been selected and grouped so that the modern reader can pleasurably share the amazement that all readers have felt on first dipping into this remarkable work by one of the most unusual men of all time. (Fall 1957)",
    "Original ML abridgment ofThe Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, arranged and translated by Edward MacCurdy and published in U.S. by Reynal & Hitchcock, 1938. ML edition published November 1957.WR2 December 1957. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "Reynal & Hitchcock merged with Harcourt, Brace & Co. after Eugene Reynal’s death in 1946. Linscott approached Harcourt, Brace in the mid 1950s for permission to publish a ML abridgement ofThe Notebooks of Leonardo da Vincibut was turned down. The translation appears to have been in the public domain, and Cerf wrote the following year offering Harcourt, Brace a courtesy fee of $300 (Cerf to Jovanovich, 29 March 1956). A contract was signed, and the ML edition carries the statement, “Published by arrangement with Harcourt, Brace and Company” (p. [iv]).",
    "The translator Edward MacCurdy sometimes used the spelling McCurdy (OCLC authority record #1622156). Linscott received a flat fee of $1,350 for abridging the text and editing the ML edition. He told Cerf that the project was about twice the work he anticipated because of the poor editing of the complete edition.",
    "The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinciwas the first abridgment that Linscott made for the ML after his retirement from Random House. The others were Vasari’sLives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects(1959: 515) andThe Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson(1960: 520)."
