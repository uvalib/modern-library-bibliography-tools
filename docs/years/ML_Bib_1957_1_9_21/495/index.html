Front flap: The passing of three centuries has not dimmed Molière’s genius nor changed the perennial vices at which he hurled his shafts of comedy. The follies and frailties of mankind still feel the impact of his urbane wit and his meaningful laughter. The eight plays in this volume, complete and unabridged, are among Molière’s best comedies. They give full evidence of his undisputed rank as the foremost dramatist in all French literature and concededly one of the world’s greatest since Shakespeare. These plays have all been newly translated for this edition by Morris Bishop of Cornell University with skillful fidelity that will establish these translations as the definitive ones of our time. (Fall 1957) Original ML collection superseding Molière’sPlays(110). Published November 1957.WR2 December 1957. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.
