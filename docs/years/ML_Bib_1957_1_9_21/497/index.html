Front flap: This book contains some of the best stories of all time—among them the stories of Tristan and Isolt, Aucassin and Nicolete, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and other figures of literary or historic fame. The widely varied romances in this volume—presented here in the best modern versions available—will provide many hours of memorably pleasant reading. The editors of this book, Roger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis, both of Columbia University, have skillfully selected those romances best suited to contemporary taste. Their Introduction and their special comments before each story are certain to add to the reader’s enjoyment of this rich legacy of medieval literature. (Fall 1957) Original ML anthology. Published November 1957.WR2 December 1957. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Stein had been considering an anthology likeMedieval Romancesfor several years. In 1952 he wrote Haskell Block of the University of Wisconsin, “In a very tentative way I have thought of the possibility of our doing a little collection of epic and romance in the Modern Library some day. I don’t know whether such a thing would ever go, but I have been asking people for suggestions as to contents . . .” (Stein to Block, 31 October 1952). Roger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis initially received royalties of 5 cents a copy. In 1961, when ML books were selling for $1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based on a retail price of $1.45. (Medieval Romanceswas published at $1.65, but the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still $1.45.) Random House usually rejected requests for higher royalties on these grounds, but the Loomis’s royalties were increased to 10 cents a copy. 497b.

WhenMedieval Romanceswas published both editors were affiliated with Columbia University. After Laura Hibbard Loomis’s death in 1960 her husband may have asked that her affiliation with Columbia University be removed from the title page and jacket. Roger Sherman Loomis’s affiliation with Columbia continued as professor emeritus from his retirement in 1958 until his death in 1966."
