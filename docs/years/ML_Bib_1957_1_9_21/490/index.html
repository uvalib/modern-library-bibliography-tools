Front flap: When Nora Helmer closed the door on her doll’s house, the modern drama came into being. It was not so much that she asserted her emancipation from a stifling marriage, but that Henrik Ibsen himself proclaimed the playwright’s emancipation from the spiritless drama of his time.ADoll’s House,Hedda Gabler,The Master Builder, Ghosts,AnEnemy of the People, andRosmersholmadvanced the liberation in terms of social drama which revealed human beings confronted with present-day problems and willing to face their consequences. These completely new translations—specially prepared for this edition by Eva Le Gallienne and benefiting from her experience as one of the most thoughtful actresses and directors of the American stage—combine the accuracy, the literary taste and the dramatic naturalness that characterize all distinguished and enduring translations.
