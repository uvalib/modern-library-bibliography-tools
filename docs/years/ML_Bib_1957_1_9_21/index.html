Less than three years later, on 1 January 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65."

Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the retail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers to whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties were going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no general policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to be paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only when pressure from individual authors and publishers left no alternative."

His ability to hold the reader utterly enchanted is well represented in the contents of this collection of seventeen of Maugham’s best stories, including such favorite and famous works as “Rain,” “The Letter,” and “The Colonel’s Lady.” Devotees of Maugham will welcome this skillful selection of John Beecroft. New readers of Maugham’s stories will find here many hours of delightful reading and re–reading. ("
