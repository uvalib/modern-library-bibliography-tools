    "The story of the Russian Czars is one long carnival of cruelty and lust, of a great, overgrown, thoroughly rotten Oriental despotism gradually but certainly tottering to its fall. A whole dynasty plays its part in this book—Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, the Empress Catherine, and finally, Nicholas the Terrified. The Imperial Orgy is in effect a moving picture history of Russia with the Czars as the principle actors.",
