(Spring 1929) JacketC:Non-pictorial in dark bluish green (165) and black on cream paper with title and decorations in reverse on inset dark bluish green panel; other lettering in black, borders in dark bluish green. Jacket title:An Anthology of Modern American Poetry. Front flap: The vigor and diversity of contemporary American poetry is made strikingly manifest in this anthology. The selections by Conrad Aiken are distinguished for their good taste and the wide range of poetic gifts they reveal. Each of the poets in this volume is generously represented by from a few to a dozen or more poems, an unusual feature in an anthology and one which does greater justice to the whole range of the poet’s work than would the selection of the familiar, isolated poem. (Spring 1935) Originally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged chronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by Aiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in Aiken’s preface. Published February 1927.WR12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Cerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy forModern American Poetsand indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to $700 for permissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He urged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the Secker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos Williams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March 1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single poem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of Williams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,” bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S. Eliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six. Aiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that permissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the preface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have been unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr Ezra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously belong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence of Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to the ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of Mr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence for which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of these three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2) published in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by Sandburg but none by Masters. Later in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s poems in the ML Giant,An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry(G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging of Aiken’sComprehensive Anthology of American Poetry(169.2). 137.1b.

They speak for a half century of growth in America.” (Fall 1955) Original ML anthology. Published March 1945.WRnot found. First printing: 3,000 copies. Aiken suggested revising and modernizingModern American Poetsin 1932 (Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until fall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that Aiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound, Archibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated that he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S. Eliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate Maxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also expressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems. However, whenTwentieth-Century American Poetrywas in galley proofs Linscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except Eliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken eliminated all but two of his own poems. Wartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles in print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML authors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote that fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod Lib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed serious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our lifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib doesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir? Will we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this year, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow” (Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of his ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be printed when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944). The revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared early in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional printings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year, but Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the possibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the year, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your anthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count too heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many demands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary paper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945). Twentieth-Century American Poetrywas out of stock for about six months in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken $500 against 1947 royalties to help him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken, 6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in stock for the first time since the war” (PW, 18 September 1948, p. 1095). 137.3a.

Jacket:Non-pictorial in strong greenish blue (169), vivid greenish yellow (97) and black on coated white paper; title and editor in reverse, series in black, other lettering in vivid greenish yellow, all against strong greenish blue background. Front flap: The variety and brilliance of contemporary American poetry are reflected in this new selection by Conrad Aiken. Eighty-one poets are presented, and of these, twenty-three now appear in an anthology for the first time. Mr. Aiken’s awareness of what is relevant, rather than what is merely “modish,” makes this anthology a critical as well as historical record of the growth and major tendencies of American poetry during the first half of this century. (Spring 1963) Original ML anthology. Published April 1963.WR22 April 1963. First printing: 10,000 copies. Aiken expressed interest in revisingTwentieth-Century American Poetryin 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8 February 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960. Epstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at least $4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised anthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a third. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new collection, and it would require new permissions fees forallthe poems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from the 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material (Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962). Aiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there was a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings totaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before 1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp. 109, 120). 137.3b.

Jacket:Fujita non-pictorial jacket in vivid red (11), deep blue (179) and black on coated white paper with title in black, other lettering in vivid red, and two decorative curved bands in deep blue and vivid red within black single-rule frame, all against white background. Front flap: The variety, richness and depth of contemporary American poetry are reflected in this collection by Conrad Aiken. A balanced choice from the works of the major poets gives an idea of the range of each; Frost, Eliot, Stevens, and Lowell, among others, are represented by substantial selections, while Mr. Aiken opens a broader view of American poetry through selections from a wide variety of lesser known and newer poets. In all, eighty-one poets are presented, many of them for the first time in an anthology. The arrangement of this volume by Mr. Aiken, himself a much-honored poet, provides a critical as well as historical record of the major tendencies of American poetry during the first half of this century.
