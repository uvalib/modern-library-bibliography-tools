(Fall 1927) Jacket B: Uniform typographic jacket B2b. Text on front as B2a except quotation mark added before “Why Men Fight”; last line has four words. JacketC:Uniform typographic jacket D. (Spring 1929) Front flap: Upon the completion of hisPrincipia Mathematica, in collaboration with Dr. Whitehead, Bertrand Russell reached the conclusion that little could be achieved by writings addressed exclusively to specialists. Abstract pursuits gave way to a quest for a better way of life, where co-operation, not competition, is the road to happiness. These essays reveal the quintessence of Bertrand Russell’s enlightened philosophy. They are for readers who are conscious of the social and political problems of our age and who seek solutions under the guidance of science and a humane philosophy. (Spring 1936) Original ML collection. Published October 1927.WR22 October 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Shortly after publication ofThe Philosophy of William James(119) Cerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to Bertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to have declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife to the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed to select the contents and secure permissions from the original publishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond writing the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of the editorial work. When the introduction arrivedCerf wrote Komroff: There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him, however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!” (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926) Komroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He went on: I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark to [sic] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured. The whole sceme [sic] was my idea in the first place and it would have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam [sic] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926). 147b.
