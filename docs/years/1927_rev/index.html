I am getting no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a good spiritual effect on my life. I’ve let everyone around the office know this and I’ll see that the publishing world at large knows it too. I’m thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19, Wallerstein family folder)."

If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities; and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of our own day.

Other revisions consisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,” bringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S.

The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear  the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective.
