    "REMY DE GOURMONT’S somewhat cerebral passions have ample scope in the suave story of the courtship of a presumably innocent young girl by a sophisticated middle-aged man, incorporated in “A Virgin Heart.” Contrary to the accepted notion and to the ideas of the amorous M. Hervart, the modest, gentle, unassuming Rose is surprised at nothing, except the tepidity and reserve of her lover. Abstraction, insinuation and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s limpid and flexibly articulated prose.",
    "Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product, almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont.",
    "(Remy de Gourmont’s “A Night in the Luxembourg” is volume Number 120 in the Modern Library)  (Spring 1927)",
    "JacketB:Uniform typographic jacket D. (Fall 1930)",
    "Huxley translation originally published by Nicholas L. Brown, 1921. New edition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its acquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by Greenberg. ML edition (pp. [5]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg plates. Published June 1927.WR16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933.",
    "Edmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (Axel’s Castle, p. 22).",
    "Huxley’s translation ofA Virgin Heartappeared in the U.S. five years before Allen & Unwin published it in Britain.",
    "The ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translatedA Virgin Heart, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley declined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh his memory ofAVirgin Heartand Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to Cerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an introduction.",
    "Greenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year after the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain, noting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our Modern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the spirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this title has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg, 21 October 1927).",
    "There were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1928 and December 1931. AfterA Virgin Heartwas discontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold, most of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June 1933).",
