Text on front: Ironically enough, it was the vain effort of a self-appointed censor to suppress “The Rainbow” that first called to the attention of the general public the enduring qualities of the book. It is one of those novels which England has produced that resembles its own immemorial oaks, with roots striking deep into the rich soil – the story of the Brangwens, whose menfolk, sturdy, lusty yeomen, might have had a place beside the knights and squires among the Canterbury Pilgrims. (Spring 1927) JacketB:Uniform typographic jacket D. (Spring 1929) Front flap: The fierce ecstasy and sensual violence that pervade the novels of D. H. Lawrence reach their highest and most lyrical note inThe Rainbow. The sturdy generations of Nottingham Brangwens of whom Lawrence writes are men and women of his own blood, possessed as he was by the hot, fecund urgency of the flesh, and made aware of all the dark and mystical labyrinths of physical love.The Rainbowranks with the most distinguished works of fiction in our language dealing with sex, exalted and unashamed.
