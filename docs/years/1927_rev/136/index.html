The third part title (pp. [249–250]) is a tipped-in replacement leaf. The content of the leaf is as follows: THIRD PART | ON MAN’S WELL-BEING | [5-line epigraph enclosed in a single-rule frame] All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the | quality of the object to which we are attached by love. | Love for an object external and infinite feeds the mind | with joy alone, a joy that is free from all sorrow. | Spinoza.",

(Imitation leather binding; probably the second printing)",
    "Format:The first printing is in the standard 6½ by 4¼ inch format with very narrow margins at the top and foot. Several later printings of 136a are about ¼ inch taller and wider than the standard format. Narrow margins were sometimes unavoidable when the ML printed from other publishers’ plates, but it was unusual for a typesetting designed for the ML to have such narrow margins. It is possible that the size of the type page was determined by an economic decision to limit the volume to fourteen gatherings of sixteen leaves each.",

    "Mr. Ratner remarks that “after having been one of the liberating thinkers of mankind who was read but not honored, Spinoza is fast becoming one of the canonized of mankind who are honored but not read.” This volume with its Life, Introduction, and Selections will immensely assist to get Spinoza read and understood as well as honored. If Mr. Ratner had not actually accomplished the task, I should not have thought it possible to render evident and outstanding the significant ideas of Spinoza, freed from obscuring technicalities; and to do it in such a way as to make clear to the reader their kinship with perplexing religious, moral and intellectual questions of our own day. But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the extracts from Spinoza’sEthicsbetween selections from his more popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech, etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” —John Dewey.  (Spring 1927)",

    "Professor Ratner’s masterly arrangement of Spinoza’s philosophy has become the standard text in leading universities throughout the country. John Dewey writes: “I shall be disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the light and leading which he can give.” (Spring 1935)",
    "Original ML collection. Published February 1927.WR12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained.  Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "Ratner was born in 1901 and received his M.A. from Columbia University in 1923. He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy department at Columbia when he compiledThe Philosophy of Spinoza. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.",
    "Cerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on Ratner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on Biblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract on Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I believe the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the excessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6 October 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza continues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7 June 1927).",
    "In April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York, Ratner sold his rights toThe Philosophy of Spinozaand John Dewey’sIntelligence in the Modern World(G41) for $500. He also retained the unearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the previous year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700. The two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner received no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the contracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus royalties accrued from 1 January 1940.",

For three centuries his writings have been one of the great glories of the human spirit.
