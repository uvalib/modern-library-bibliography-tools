    "“The question that starts to the lips of ninety-nine readers out of a hundred, even the best informed, will assuredly be: ‘Who is Ambrose Bierce?’ You may wander for years through literary circles and never meet anybody who has heard of him; and then you may hear some erudite student whisper in an awed voice: ‘Ambrose Bierce is the greatest modern prose writer!’” —Arnold Bennett",
    "“Bierce was the first writer of fiction to treat war realistically. He antedated even Zola. . . . So far in this life, I have encountered no more thoroughgoing cynic than Bierce. Out of the spectacle of life about him he got an unflagging and Gargantuan joy”.  —H. L. Mencken.",
    "George Sterling, lifelong friend of Ambrose Bierce, wrote the introduction for this volume two weeks before his tragic death. It was the last writing from his pen. (Spring 1927)",
    "JacketB:Uniform typographic jacket D. (Fall 1929)",
    "Front flap:",
    "More and more the fame of Ambrose Bierce grows, not so much from his fantastic life and mysterious death, but from his haunting and unforgettable tales. His art is candidly inhuman, yet the clarity and perfection of his style and his dramatic fervor give these “terror tales” a secure place among the classic short stories of literature. The first two stories in this volume— “A Horseman in the Sky” and “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge”—are generally considered Bierce’s best. (Fall 1935)",
    "Originally published asTales of Soldiers and Civiliansby E. L. G. Steele, 1891. New edition with a revised selection of stories published asIn the Midst of Life: Tales of Soldiers and Civiliansby Neale Publishing Co., 1909 (The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce, vol. 2); reprinted as a separate volume by Boni & Liveright, 1918, and Albert & Charles Boni, 1924.

    "William Chislett, Jr., of Albright College in Pennsylvania corresponded with the ML in 1926 about an anthology of Bierce’s writings that he had prepared, but he was unable to secure the necessary copyright permissions (RH box 72, Chislett folder).",
