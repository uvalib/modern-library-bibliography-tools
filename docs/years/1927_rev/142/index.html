    "Olive Schreiner finished “The Story of An African Farm” in 1879. Like many other good books, it was promptly rejected times without number, but was accepted finally by the London house of Chapman and Hall, on the advice of their reader, George Meredith.",
    "The book was an immediate success. It is difficult to imagine that a work so singular in atmosphere, so potent in its passion, should ever have been anything else. To this day, it ranks as the great epic of a South Africa that has ceased to exist—a civilization that heard its sentence of death when gold was discovered on the Ridge of the White Waters. (Spring1927)",

    "To George Meredith, then a publisher’s reader, belongs the credit for having saved from oblivion a manuscript that has become the spiritual expression of South Africa. Upon its publication in 1879,The Story of an African Farmwon world-wide acclaim for its author as a writer of genius. The burning passion that illuminates its pages gives conviction to a story unique in the annals of literature. Olive Schreiner was a child of the South Africa that has ceased to exist; her book is its crowning monument and memorial. (Fall 1933)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Roberts Brothers, 1888, and from 1898 by Little, Brown & Co.
