    "“ECCE HOMO” is a fitting summary of Nietzsche’s character as a man and his achievement as a thinker. “The Birth of Tragedy” is one of the most difficult of his works to obtain in an adequate translation. Both are presented here complete and unabridged.",
    "Nietzsche’s other most important works may be obtained in Modern Library editions. “Thus Spake Zarathustra” is Volume Number 9, “Beyond Good and Evil” is Number 20, and “The Genealogy of Morals” is Number 62. (Spring 1927)",
    "JacketB:Uniform typographic jacket D. (Fall 1930)",
    "Front flap:",
    "Ecce Homois a summary of Friedrich Nietzsche’s philosophy and his most robust affirmation of life. In these respects it is a spiritual and intellectual autobiography that proclaims with vigorous emphasis the virtues of strength and pride. The juxtaposition ofEcce HomoandThe Birth of Tragedyin one volume gains significance by opposite attitudes towards Richard Wagner. The latter work is dedicated to him “as my noble champion,” and the former contains many of Nietzsche’s most virulent attacks on the Master of Bayreuth. (Fall 1933)",
    "Original ML translation. Published February 1927.WR12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the four Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged asThe Philosophy of Nietzsche(G32).",
    "After discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’sDawn of Daywith Macmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wantedEcce Homoinstead. They hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England and offered an advance of $200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They asked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance that Macmillan would not putEcce Homointo its series of inexpensive reprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent firm in London but the response was slow in coming.",
    "After waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their own translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of Columbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended Horace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss indicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer than they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of his graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation ofEcce HomoandThe Birth of Tragedyand to submit the manuscript by 6 December.",
    "Approval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in mid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with Fadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October 1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but in time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition ofEcce Homo & The Birth of Tragedywas the first time Fadiman’s name was attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,”SRL, 22 May 1943, p. 37).",
