    "Joseph Conrad wrote of W. H. Hudson: “You can’t tell how this fellow gets his effects. He writes as the grass grows; the good God makes it there, and that is all there is to it.” Possibly it was because he was not overly occupied with “getting an effect”, that Hudson’s prose steals upon us like a change in the evening sky, or on the surface of the sea at sunrise.",
    "The Purple Land of which Hudson writes has vanished and become the model republic of Uruguay. Roads and railways cut through the vast savannahs over which Hudson’s youthful hero rode. The incredibly innocent and romantic young ladies whom he met have borne daughters, who visit Paris and New York and take back with them shingled heads, golf-sticks and police dogs. The golden age of the Banda Oriental is gone, but it is preserved forever in the crystal clarity of these pages, the legacy of one of the great spirits of his age. (Spring 1927)",

    "Whether considered as a romance, a book of travel and geography, a naturalist’s excursion, or a nostalgic remembrance,The Purple Landretains through the years an undimmed charm. The crystalline quality of its prose, the leisurely pace at which it rambles through the wide savannahs and sweeping pampas give it the serene simplicity of greatness. It captures the spirit of a glamorous lost land and conveys the power and imaginative insight of its famous chronicler.The Purple Landis a companion volume in the Modern Library toGreen Mansions(No. 89.) (Spring 1934)",
