    "“I consider Hawthorne the most consummate literary artist in American literature, and ‘The Scarlet Letter’ the greatest book ever written in the Western Hemisphere. It holds its place among the fifteen best novels of the world.” —William Lyon Phelps",
    "The inclusion of “The Scarlett Letter” in this series adds the name of Hawthorne to a roster of American authors that already contains Poe, Whitman, James, Melville, Dreiser, Anderson, Hearn, Crane, Bierce, O’Neill, Hecht and Beebe. As many more American works will be added as can be found to be consistent with the standards of the Modern Library.(Spring 1927)",

    "Of the few authors who have escaped the iconoclastic onslaughts of modern criticism, Nathaniel Hawthorne stands unassailed and with undiminished prestige among America’s immortals. Generations of readers have been moved by the austere and relentless power ofThe Scarlet Letter. For its revelation of a guilt-stricken attitude toward sin, for its intense human interest and its purity of diction and accuracy of analysis, for its interpretation of the Puritan way of life, the story of Hester Phrynne [sic] has inevitably become part of our national legacy. (Fall 1933)",
    "ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1927.WR12 March 1927. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "When Cerf invited Phelps to write the introduction he indicated thatThe Scarlet Letterwas being added to the series as part of “our endeavor to include . . . as many great American works as possible” and reminded the Yale professor that the ML had no introduction by him (Cerf to Phelps, 5 October 1926). Phelps missed the 15 November deadline by nearly a month and offered to waive the $50 fee (Phelps to Cerf, 12 December 1926), but Cerf sent it to him anyway.",
    "The text of 133.1 is that of the second edition (Clark, p. 162).",
    "The Scarlet Letterdid not rank among the 99 best-selling ML titles during the first six months of 1928. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It ranked high in the second quarter if ML titles by the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

    "Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Stein offered Gerber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Gerber, 25 January 1950). He also sought Gerber’s advice about the text: “We are planning to reset the text ofThe Scarlet Letterfor the college edition and I want to check with you on the best text available. Our present text is that of the second edition, though I suspect that it occasionally backslides” (Stein to Gerber, 6 March 1950). Gerber recommended the text of the third or stereotyped edition published by Ticknor, Reed and Fields in 1850 (Gerber to Stein, 11 April 1950). Stein indicated that the text, including the “Preface to the Second Edition,” was being set from the stereotyped edition (Stein to Gerber, 17 April 1950).",
