Cellini’s amours and hatreds, his passions and delights, his love of the sumptuous and the exquisite in art, his self–applause and self-assertion, running now and again into extravagances which it is impossible to credit, make this one of the most singular and fascinating books in existence.

His autobiography, like his work in rare jewels and marble, is a record of grandeur and beauty. It remains today, as it has for almost three centuries, unparalleled in literature as a chronicle of a life consecrated to passion and to pleasure, to vast and delicate creative enterprises and to dangerous escapades. Its vivacity and its untameable defiance give it an unchallenged first rank among all the autobiographies of the world. (Fall 1934)"

Benvenuto Cellini, an audaciously self-serving Florentine goldsmith, tells of his escapades with the frankness and egoism characteristic of the Renaissance man, describing a life of unequaled grandeur, passion and adventure. It remains today one of the world masterpieces of autobiographical writing."
