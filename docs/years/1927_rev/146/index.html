To lash the age, to ridicule vain pretension, to expose hypocrisy, to deride humbug in education, politics, and religion, are tasks beyond most men’s powers; but occasionally, very occasionally, a bit of genuine satire secures for itself more than a passing nod of recognition. ‘Erewhon,’ I think, is such a satire.” (Fall 1927)"

Underneath his irrepressible, malicious laughter however, he waged a serious war with bigotry, sham and stupidity. (Spring 1936)"
