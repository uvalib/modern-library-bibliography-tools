<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1928</h1>
<h2>1928</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Boni &amp; Liveright, Inc., became Horace Liveright, Inc., on 28 May. Boni
had left the firm nearly nine years earlier, in July 1919.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued ten titles,
all but one of which were from the Boni &amp; Liveright period, bringing the
total number of active titles to 148. D’Annunzio, <em>Maidens of the Rocks</em>
(1926), which Cerf and Klopfer added shortly after they took over the
series, was the first title for which they had been responsible to be
discontinued. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated
here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s
practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall
lists.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles except France, <em>Revolt of the Angels</em> (163) were
published in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in.
(168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). The
first printing had a trim size of 6⅝ x 4½ in. (167 x 108 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>Most new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/modern-library-bibliography-tools/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>, (some
Fall titles had B or A3) and the last line of the title page as
PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of
earlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine
lettering in gold and the Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front
cover.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Bernhard</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>Spring 1928 titles were the last published in uniform typographic jacket
B2. A redesigned typographic jacket was introduced in September and
modified in October. In addition to uniform typographic jackets, a
limited number of titles were also available in pictorial jackets. The
option of pictorial jackets may have been inspired by the 1928 Christmas
Gift Box, which featured pictorial jackets printed in spring 1928.
Pictorial jackets are rare; the number of titles available with
pictorial jackets as well as uniform typographic jackets is unknown. Two
examples are reproduced in the illustrations.</p>
<p>Uniform typographic jacket C, which was completely redesigned except for
the torchbearer on the spine and the horizontal bands near the top and
foot, was introduced in September 1928 and used on only two titles,
Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel (162) and France, Revolt of the
Angels (163). Both jackets were printed on pale yellow paper; series THE
MODERN LIBRARY appeared in the lower. The paragraph of descriptive text
that had been used on the front panel of ML jackets since 1917 was
dropped completely. In its place was the title in large capitals that
could be read easily from a distance of five or six feet, a torchbearer
that was nearly twice the size of the torchbearer on uniform typographic
jacket B2, and brief descriptive text in smaller type. The jacket for
The Revolt of the Angels stated, “One of the five of Anatole France’s
greatest books available in this edition”; that of Gargantua and
Pantagruel stated, “Intelligently condensed into one volume by <span
class="smallcaps">prof. donald douglas</span> of Columbia University.”
The colored rules did not make the books stand out on bookstore shelves,
and uniform jacket C was replaced the following month by uniform
typographic jacket D.</p>
<p>Uniform typographic jacket D, introduced with the two October titles,
Symonds, Life of Michaelangelo Buonnaroti (164) and The Philosophy of
Schopenhauer (165), was a significant improvement. The new jackets
differed from uniform typographic jacket C in two respects. The colored
rules near the top and foot were extended to the upper and lower edges
of the jacket, creating colored borders 7/16 inch wide which extended
over the front and back panels, backstrip, and jacket flaps. And the
jackets were printed in different color combinations. The borders were
printed in deep reddish orange, moderate blue, or moderate yellowish
green; the paper stock was light greenish blue, brilliant yellow, or
pale yellow. Most booksellers displayed Modern Library books together.
The vivid and varied colors of the jacket borders and paper stock
significantly increased the visual appeal of groups of ML books
displayed in book and department stores.</p>
<p>The Modern Library printed new uniform jackets for the entire series,
not just for newly published titles. First printings of Gargantua and
Pantagruel and Revolt of the Angels, originally published in uniform
typographic jacket C, are also found in uniform typographic jacket D.</p>
<p>The text on the back panel of uniform typographic jackets C and D was
also revised.</p>
<p>The upper band which indicates the author on the front panel and spine,
contains the following statement on the back panel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smallcaps">the modern library</span></p>
<p>Books that have something to say</p>
<p>to the Modern Mind</p>
<p>The area between the upper and lower bands states:</p>
<p><em>How many</em> <span class="smallcaps">modern library</span> <em>books</em></p>
<p><em>have you read?</em></p>
<p>A complete list of the 150 books in The Modern Library series will be
found on the inside of the jacket. They are representative works by
modern authors of the first rank, supplemented by a group of books
that, although they were written centuries ago, are still <em>modern</em> in
the full sense of the word. How many of these books have you read? How
many are in your library? Handsome, durable, and inexpensive Modern
Library editions enable them to be secured at a fraction of their
usual cost. Jot down the numbers of volumes you desire on the coupon
below. Give it to your bookseller. If there is no bookseller near you,
the publisher will supply you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like uniform jacket B2, a complete list of Modern Library titles is
printed inside uniform typographic jackets C and D.</p>

(<em>Fall</em>) Apuleius, <em>Golden Ass</em> xDostoyevsky, <em>Brothers Karamazov</em>.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in several titles published by Doubleday, Doran,
including works by Joseph Conrad (<em>Victory</em>, <em>Lord Jim</em>, <em>Youth</em>,
<em>Chance</em>, or <em>Nigger of the Narcissus</em>), Aldous Huxley (<em>Chrome Yellow</em>
or <em>Antic Hay</em>), W. Somerset Maugham (<em>Of Human Bondage</em>, <em>The Moon and
Sixpence</em>, or <em>The Trembling of a Leaf</em>), William McFee (<em>Captain
Macedoine’s Daughter</em>, <em>Command</em>, or <em>Casuals of the Sea</em>), and Horace
Walpole (<em>Fortitude</em>). He offered the ML’s highest royalty—12 cents a
copy—on any of these books (Cerf to Russell Doubleday, 25 April 1928),
but Doubleday, Doran was not receptive. The Modern Library was able to
include seven of these titles—<em>Victory</em>, <em>Lord Jim</em>, <em>Antic Hay</em>, <em>Of
Human Bondage</em>, <em>Moon and Sixpence</em>, <em>Casuals of the Sea</em>, and
<em>Fortitude</em>—in the early 1930s as a result of its purchase of the Sun
Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint
subsidiary. (See the introductory matter for 1930 for more information
on the Sun Dial Library purchase.)</p>
<p>Another author Cerf wanted in the ML was Ernest Hemingway. He told
Hemingway, “We are very anxious indeed to add a book of yours to our
Modern Library series” (Cerf to Hemingway, 29 October 1928). The ML was
able to secure reprint rights to <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> and <em>A Farewell to
Arms</em> in the early 1930s; <em>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</em> was
added to ML Giants in 1942.</p>
<p>When Cerf told Sinclair Lewis that he wanted one if his books in the
series, Lewis replied that the decision was up to Harcourt, Brace (Lewis
to Cerf, 1928). The ML was able to add <em>Arrowsmith</em> in 1933 and three
additional titles by Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p>Bernice Baumgarten of the literary agency Brandt &amp; Brandt suggested a ML
edition of John Dos Passos, <em>Three Soldiers</em>, which had never appeared
in a reprint edition (Baumgarten to Cerf, 6 March 1928). Cerf, who had
previously declined to reprint Dos Passos’s <em>Manhattan Transfer</em>,
replied, “We will not be interested in doing John Dos Passos’ ‘Three
Soldiers’ in the Modern Library. I know the book well, and though I
think it is an excellent piece of work, I do not feel that Dos Passos
quite rates the Modern Library” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 7 March 1928). Cerf
later changed his mind. Three books by Dos Passos were published in the
ML in the 1930s: <em>Three Soldiers</em> (1932: 248), <em>The</em> <em>42nd Parallel</em>
(1937: 307), and <em>U.S.A.</em> (1939: G42).</p>
<p>Cerf offered Harcourt, Brace an advance of $1,800 against royalties of
12 cents a copy for reprint rights to Lytton Strachey’s <em>Queen
Victoria</em>, provided the ML could print from Harcourt plates (Cerf to
Harrison Smith, 21 April 1928). Harcourt, Brace declined on the grounds
that Strachey’s <em>Elizabeth and Essex</em>, published that year, would revive
interest in the earlier work (Harrison Smith to Cerf, 11 May 1928).
Strachey’s <em>Eminent Victorians</em> was added to the series in 1933.</p>
<p>Cerf also wanted to include anthologies devoted to American poetry and
English poetry. Conrad Aiken’s <em>American Poetry, 1671–1928: A
Comprehensive Anthology</em> (169.1), published early in 1928, was compiled
for the Modern Library. Cerf sought permission to reprint John
Drinkwater’s <em>Anthology of English Verse</em> (Houghton Mifflin, 1924), but
the publisher rejected the offer (Curtis Brown to Cerf, 13 July 1928).</p>
<p>Klopfer offered a $4,000 advance against a royalty of 12 cents a copy
for James Stephens’s <em>Crock of Gold</em> (Klopfer to H. C. Latham,
Macmillan, 27 November 1928). Despite subsequent offers, the book never
appeared in the ML. Appleton declined Cerf’s offer of a $3,000 advance
against royalties of 10 cents a copy for Stephen Crane’s <em>Red Badge of
Courage</em> (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton &amp; Co., 12 December 1928).
The ML finally secured reprint rights to Crane’s novel fourteen years
later.</p>
<p>E. Clark Stillman suggested a volume of Heinrich Heine’s poems for the
ML and offered to do the translations (Stillman to ML, 15 June 1928). A
reader suggested a volume of poetry by Alfred Noyes. Cerf replied to the
latter suggestion, “. . . the idea is a mighty good one, and we shall
investigate it at once” (Cerf to Mrs. R. G. Pattern, 29 October 1928).
Nothing came of either suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas gift box</strong></p>
<p>For the 1928 Christmas season the ML offered a boxed set titled <em>Three
Renaissance Romances</em> consisting of three titles—Cellini,
<em>Autobiography</em> (1927: 132), Merejkowski, <em>Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em>
(1928: 154), and Symonds, <em>Life of Michelangelo</em> <em>Buonarroti</em> (1928:
164) in distinctive bindings and jackets. The bindings were brightly
colored Keratol, a treated book cloth stamped in a geometric pattern,
with the same gold stamping as other volumes of the period. The Cellini
binding was light greenish blue (172), Merejkowski was vivid orange
(48), Symonds was light yellowish green (135). Each jacket had an inset
illustration printed in black on colored paper; the jackets are
described in the entries for each title. Volumes in Keratol bindings
have spring 1928 jackets and fall 1928 lists at the end of the volumes,
except for Cellini which has no list. The retail price of each set was
$2.85. Orders came mainly from department stores. Cerf noted after the
Christmas season that the boxed set had proved so popular that it would
be carried in stock regularly (Cerf to Desmond FitzGerald, 13 February
1929). This does not appear to have been done, but the <em>Three
Renaissance Romances</em> gift box was offered again during the 1929
Christmas season.</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1915, using sheets
of the English edition. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting, omitting the index and illustrations. Publication announced
for January 1928; probably published in December 1927. <em>WR</em> 7 January
1928. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1936.</p>
<p>The ML arranged its edition directly with Douglas, who wrote a new
introduction and received royalties of 5 cents a copy. The ML edition
was the first to be printed in the U.S. Cerf offered to sell duplicate
plates to the English publisher Martin Secker for use in his New Adelphi
Library, but Secker decided not to include <em>Old Calabria</em> in the series
(Cerf to Secker, 25 July 1928; Secker to Cerf, 14 August 1928).</p>
<p>There was a second printing of 3,057 copies in March 1931 (Woolf, p.
46).</p>
<p>Sales during the first six months of 1928 placed <em>Old Calabria</em> 37th out
of 147 ML titles. It was listed in 1931 as one of the ML’s worst-selling
titles (“Notes on the Modern Library,” RH box 117, Publicity folder). It
was discontinued after returns from booksellers exceeded sales during
the last part of 1935.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“NANA”, Zola’s famous story of the theatrical underworld in Paris, is
an excellent example of the virtues and faults of the acknowledged
founder of the realistic school in modern fiction. “Zola”, writes
Burton Rascoe, “was a boorish and heavy handed seducer who urged upon
the novel a very raw and potent drink. He showed that life, even in
fiction, might be stripped of the enameled exterior of cultural
standards and refinements, and the substratum of animality that cannot
die be portrayed in its true light.” (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1928</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C</em>: Three French Romances gift box. (1929)</p>
<p><em>Jacket D:</em> Pictorial in strong yellowish pink (26) and black on light
pink paper with inset oval illustration of a woman with parasol and four
winged cherubs; lettering in black except title in strong yellowish pink
and black, borders in strong yellowish pink. (<em>Fall 1932</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket E:</em> Pictorial in dark yellowish pink (30) and moderate reddish
brown (43) on cream paper with head-and-shoulders illustration of a
woman glancing to her right; lettering in moderate reddish brown except
title in dark yellowish pink outlined in moderate reddish brown, borders
in dark yellowish pink. Signed: Newman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Banned in England in 1888 for its so-called obscenity, <em>Nana</em> has
since come to be regarded the highest achievement among the novels of
the Naturalist school. Its author is now acknowledged as the source
from which the English realists and our own Frank Norris and Theodore
Dreiser derive their greatest influence. Regardless of the sensational
aspects of this work and its niche in literary history, <em>Nana</em> lives
as a novel by its own vigor and the incomparable skill and fidelity
with which it is written. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plarr translation originally published in a limited edition by the
Lutetian Society (London, 1894) and in U.S. by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1924.
ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
January 1928. <em>WR</em> 18 February 1928. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The Modern Library used the Victor Plarr translation without identifying
the translator. When a film version produced by Samuel Goldwyn and
starring the Russian actress Anna Sten was released in 1934, the ML
urged booksellers to stock <em>Nana</em> in quantity and distributed copies of
the movie poster to major bookstores.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Nana</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 2nd out of
147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was
low in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank
among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Salter, Wolff Mfg. Co., 17 July 1945). <em>Nana</em> never appeared in the

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“In ‘The Sea and the Jungle’ we have surely one of the great
achievements of maritime narrative. There need be no fatuous
comparisons. Sometimes they are useful as a label for the instruction
of those who must have things expressed in terms of what they know
already. But in speaking of this book, that has earned its right to
stand among the most thoughtful of our time, we can be absolute. The
author’s own casual phrase will serve, ‘This is a travel book for
honest men.’ Beneath the sheer beauty of the writing you will find
that plain virtue, that honesty, that fidelity to the ungainly fact.”
— <em>Christopher Morley</em> (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>C:</em> Pictorial in light green (144) and black on cream paper
with inset illustration of a man making his way through jungle foliage;
lettering in black, borders in light green. Signed: Loederer. (<em>Fall
1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
From the moment H. M. Tomlinson, caught and caged by the city, watched
the Putney bus take on a casual passenger, and then the Skipper
himself, until the <em>Capella</em> made port from Pará and the Madeira
jungle, this book spreads a tapestry of pictures and places,
adventures and yarns, and talk of great things and little in the sure
accents of truth. <em>The Sea and the Jungle</em> is more than a travel book
or a maritime narrative; it is writing of sheer beauty, unswerving
fidelity and scrupulous honesty. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton Co., 1913, using sheets of
the English edition published by Duckworth. ML edition printed from
plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1928. <em>WR</em> 17
March 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.</p>
<p><em>The Sea and the Jungle</em> appears to have been in the U.S. public domain
because of its original publication in the U.S using imported sheets.
The ML paid royalties directly to Tomlinson.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>The Sea and the Jungle</em> during the first six months of 1928
placed it 15th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms
of sales.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
However much the industry of Alexandre Dumas is held up as an example
of literature in its first manifestations of mass production, <em>The
Three Musketeers</em> still throbs with undiminished pulse for the modern
reader. Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos [<em>sic</em>] and
Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan,
there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the
progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in
fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first
and final perfection. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
Merejkowski’s trilogy of historical romances, collectively entitled
<em>Christ and Antichrist</em>, have been translated from the original
Russian into every European language. <em>The Death of the Gods</em> is the
first of the three, and has for its central figure Julian the
Apostate; <em>Leonardo</em> is the second; and the third is <em>Peter and
Alexis</em>, which is based on the tragic story of Peter the Great and his
son. Despite the fact that <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> has been heretofore
available only in very expensive editions in America, its popularity
has increased each year. Mr. Guerney’s new and complete translation
for the Modern Library brings within the reach of many new thousands
of readers the best biography of what was probably the most versatile
genius in all history. (<em>Fall 1927; spring 1928</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The insatiable spirit and the unparalleled genius of Leonardo Da
[<em>sic</em>] Vinci give radiance to this biographical romance. The heroic
grandeur of Leonardo’s achievements in art and science, the fecundity
of his mind and the illimitable reaches of his imagination are
revealed against the glowing background of the Renaissance. Kings and
popes and courtiers, artists and philosophers and poets throng the
scene. Dominating them all is Leonardo in a portrait that might have
been wrought by one of his own contemporaries. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML translation. Published 1 March 1928. <em>WR</em> 17 March 1928.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Publication was originally announced for November 1927 on the basis of
Guerney’s promise of a finished manuscript by the beginning of
September. The translation took longer than expected; the ML did not
receive final installment until 13 January 1928 (Cerf to Ronald
Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 14 January 1928).</p>
<p><em>The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em> sold 12,264 copies during the first
six months of 1928, making it the ML’s best-selling title. During the
18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was in the third quarter of ML
titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November
1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold nearly 76,000 copies during its first five years
with annual sales as follows: 23,651 copies (1928); 20,933 copies
(1929); 14,447 copies (1930); 9,404 copies (1931); and 7,334 copies
(1932) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). It was the ML’s
best-selling title during the first half of 1928, with sales of 12,264
copies. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it sold
4,736 copies, placing it in the third quarter of ML sales.</p>

<p>Four years after the publication of <em>Fourteen Great Detective Stories</em>

<p><em>Fourteen Great Detective Stories</em> was the ML’s tenth best-selling title

<p>Starrett declined an invitation in 1946 to revise <em>Fourteen Great
Detective Stories</em>, citing lack of time, the “wildly inadequate” fee,
and his lack of sympathy with the hard-boiled genre which he believed
should be represented (Starrett to Harry E. Maule, 28 July 1946). The
revised edition, edited by Howard Haycraft, was published in 1949.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
No new method of writing has been more discussed in the last decade
than Mr. Joyce’s so-called “stream of consciousness technique”; in
this novel, which was published in 1915, he handled this method for
the first time on a large scale.</p>
<p>Herbert Gorman, in his introduction to this edition of “A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man” says: “So profound and beautiful and
convincing a book is part of the lasting literature of our age, and if
it is overshadowed by the huger proportions and profundities of
“Ulysses,” we must still remember that out of it that vaster tome
evolved and that in it is the promise of that new literature, new both
in form and content, that will be the classics of tomorrow.” (<em>Spring
1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, after the
ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s epoch-making decision,
lends importance to the Modern Library edition of <em>A Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man</em>. This earlier autobiographical novel is a
prelude to <em>Ulysses</em>, and it makes clear the method and the scope of
the latter work. As the first novel to employ the stream of
consciousness technique, <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
created a revolution in modern fiction. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in book form by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, and from 1925
by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [<em>1</em>]–299) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title.
Published March 1928. <em>WR</em> 7 April 1928. First printing: 8,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p><em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> was the ML’s thirteenth
best-selling title during the first six months of 1928. During the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was at the bottom of the
first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It slipped into the second
quarter of ML titles during the 12-month period November 1951–October
1952 but sold 1,200 more copies on an annual basis than it had in
1942–43. There were thirty-eight ML printings by May 1950 for a total of
99,000 copies (Slocum and Cahoon, pp. 18–19).</p>
<p>Viking Press published <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> in its
quality paperback series, Compass Books, in August 1956. Viking Press
appears to have canceled the ML’s reprint contract in anticipation of
the Compass edition and allowed the ML to sell out its existing stock.</p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
It was the production of “The Emperor Jones” in 1920 that put the
final seal on Eugene O’Neill’s acceptance as one of America’s most
important dramatists.</p>
<p>The play is a story of a fear-crazed negro, told to the accompaniment
of a rhythmical drumbeat which starts at a normal pulse and is slowly
intensified until the heartbeat of the reader corresponds to the
frenzied beat of the drums.</p>
<p>“The Straw” was written in 1918—immediately preceding the composition
of “The Emperor Jones.” (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Alternative pictorial jacket on pale blue (185) paper with
inset illustration in black of a bare-chested black man making his way
through jungle foliage; lettering in black without horizontal borders
and rules. Signed: Davidson. (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket D:</em> Pictorial in strong orange (50) and black on yellow paper
with inset illustration of a bare-chested black man making his way
through jungle foliage; lettering in black, borders in strong orange.
Signed: Davidson. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Diversity of form and content, an unswerving artistic integrity and an
ever-renewing imaginative strength have given Eugene O’Neill his
unchallenged place among the first dramatists of the world. Even if
his reputation did not draw sustenance from his other published works,
his pre-eminence would be assured by <em>The Emperor Jones</em> alone. It is
a <em>tour de force</em> of heart-pounding relentlessness that strips naked
the terror-stricken soul of a Negro. <em>The Straw</em> reveals another facet
of Eugene O’Neill’s many-sided genius. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Emperor Jones</em> and <em>The Straw</em> originally published by Boni &amp;
Liveright, 1921, in a volume with O’Neill’s <em>Diff’rent</em>. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced
for April 1928. <em>WR</em> 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1937. Superseded February 1937 by <em>The Emperor
Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em> (299).</p>
<p>Dudley Nichols of the <em>New York World</em> wrote the introduction after
O’Neill declined to write it himself (Cerf to O’Neill, 7 December 1927;
Cerf to Nichols, 7 February 1928).</p>
<p>O’Neill made several revisions in the text of <em>The Emperor Jones</em> when
he prepared it for <em>The Complete Works of Eugene O’Neill</em> (2 vols., Boni
&amp; Liveright, 1924). The most notable were the cutting of speeches by
Smithers at the end of Scene One and the end of the play. In the revised
version Scene One ends as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Smithers [</span><em>Looks after him with a
puzzled admiration</em>]: ’E’s got ’is bloomin’ nerve with ’im, s’elp me.
[<em>Then angrily</em>.] Ho—the bleedin’ nigger—puttin’ on ’is bloody airs!
I ’opes they naps ’im an’ gives ’im an’ gives ’im what’s what!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original version continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<em>Then putting business before the pleasure of this thought, looking
around him with cupidity.</em>] A bloke ought to find a ’ole lot in this
palace that’d go for a bit of cash. Let’s take a look, ’Arry, me lad.
[<em>He starts for the doorway on right as</em></p>
<p>[<em>The curtain falls</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The revised version of the play ends with Lem’s dialogue: “Gawd blimey,
but yer died in the ’eighth o’ style, any’ow!” The original version
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<span class="smallcaps">Lem</span> <em>makes a motion to the soldiers
to carry the body out left</em>. <span class="smallcaps">Smithers</span>
speaks to him sneeringly.]</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Smithers</span>—And I s’pose you think it’s
yer bleedin’ charms and yer silly beatin’ the drum that made ’im run
in a circle when ’e’d lost ’imself, don’t yer? [<em>But</em> <span
class="smallcaps">Lem</span> <em>makes no reply, does not seem to hear
the question, walks out left after his men</em>. <span
class="smallcaps">Smithers</span> <em>looks after him with contemptuous
scorn.</em>] Stupid as ’ogs, the lot of ’em. Blarsted niggers!</p>
<p>[<em>Curtain falls</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Modern Library used the original version of <em>The Emperor Jones</em> in
some collections and the revised version in others. <em>The Emperor Jones;
The Straw</em> was probably set in type from <em>The Emperor Jones, Diff’rent,
The Straw</em> (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1921) and uses the original version. <em>The
Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em> (399), which superseded
<em>The Emperor Jones; The Straw</em> in the ML in 1937, also follows the
original text. The 1972 Vintage Books edition of <em>The Emperor Jones,
Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape</em>, which superseded the Modern Library
edition and is printed from plates made from a new typesetting, uses the
original text. The original version also appears in <em>Six Modern American
Plays</em> (441).</p>
<p>In contrast, O’Neill’s <em>Nine Plays</em> (G53), published in 1941 as a ML
Giant and printed from plates originally used by Liveright, Inc. in 1932
and later by Random House, has the revised version of <em>The Emperor
Jones</em>. The revised version also appears in the 3-volume <em>Plays of
Eugene O’Neill</em> (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition
was originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951
when <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> was added.</p>
<p><em>The Emperor Jones; The Straw</em>, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th
best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928. Sales through
1932 were as follows: 5,855 copies (1928); 2,901 copies (1929); 1,921
copies (1930); 1,405 copies (1931); 756 copies (1932) (Cerf to O’Neill,
2 June 1933).</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties to Boni &amp; Liveright of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p>O’Neill became a Random House author after the Liveright bankruptcy in
1933. Saxe Commins, his editor at Liveright, also moved to Random House.
In choosing between Coward-McCann and Random House, O’Neill wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cerf . . . has drive and enthusiasm, coupled with keen shrewdness.
Moreover, I felt Coward was trade publisher, pure and simple—but Cerf
has more to his publishing than that, a love of beautiful books, an
appreciation for good literature, an ambition to keep his firm above
the level of the others, to expand only along lines of distinction.
That, of course, appealed strongly to me. As for background for my
stuff, there is no comparison. . . . Cerf has two unique things—Modern
Library and Random House.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also thought Random House would offer better opportunities for
Commins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel strongly that Cerf is the better bet for your present and
future . . . with him, you will have a real chance to do your stuff
and a most congenial atmosphere. . . . With Cerf you’ll undoubtedly be
called upon to contribute real imagination and judgment of real
writing, once you’ve fitted in there (O’Neill to Commins, June 1933;
in Commins, ed., <em>“Love and Admiration and Respect”</em>, pp. 159-60).</p>

<h1>Although the first part of “Tristram Shandy” appeared as long ago as 1760, the editors of the Modern Library feel that they need offer no explanation for its inclusion in a series of latterday classics. Could any writing be more modern in spirit than Laurence Sterne’s—more singularly frank and unconventional? Toby Shandy is a character that will remain universally lovable and admirable for all time. (<em>1928)</em></h1>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front as jacket A.
(<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
A world deprived of the joyous and audacious spirit of <em>Tristram
Shandy</em> would be unthinkable. For two centuries Laurence Sterne’s
irrepressible book has served as an unfailing antidote for dullness
and pomposity. Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions
and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety.
Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of
temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils
its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete
and unabridged version. (<em>Spring 1934)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for April 1928. <em>WR</em> 9 June 1928. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is
traditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its
inclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R. 
H. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury
the ML abandoned after the first printing.</p>
<p>The omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of <em>Tristam Shandy</em>
traditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There
is no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there
is a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the
book by it . . .” (p. 281).</p>
<p><em>Tristram Shandy</em> was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the
first six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
“Twelve Men” shows, with a few unimportant breaks, a deliberate return
to Drieser’s first manner—the manner of pure representation, of
searching understanding, of unfailing gusto and contagious
wonderment. . . . Here are simply a dozen sketches of
character—rotund, brilliantly colored, absolutely alive. The thing is
done capitally, and, at its top points, superbly. <em>H. L. Mencken</em></p>
<p>In all these portraits there is that same sincere attempt to present
the men as they are—the modern Heliogabalus, and the modern ascetic,
the section boss, and the village patriarch. Here is wondrous,
inscrutable, fascinating life as revealed in the diversity of twelve
marionettes of the Great Impressario [<em>sic</em>]. It is one of the most
unusual books in our literature, and certainly one of the best books
that Dreiser has given us. <em>Burton Rascoe</em> (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1919. ML edition (pp.
[<em>1</em>]–360) printed from B&amp;L plates with contents page omitted.
Publication announced for June 1928. <em>WR</em> 4 August 1928. First (and
only) printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1934.</p>
<p>Cerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the
rights to <em>Twelve Men</em>. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of
$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October
1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for
royalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&amp;L for the
use of their plates. B&amp;L received $200 for approving the ML reprint;
this appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was
deducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received
$1,000 when the contract was signed.</p>
<p>Dreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the <em>New York Sun</em> (13
April 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken
$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but
Mencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis
to write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked <em>Twelve Men</em>
very much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf
to Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928).
Charles Merz of the <em>New York World</em> also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9
February 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou
of the <em>Chicago Daily News</em>, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought
to be doing this himself” (p. v).</p>
<p>Sales of the ML edition were disappointing. <em>Twelve Men</em> ranked 34th
among the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of
1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales
fell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser
file) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies
(1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421
copies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).</p>
<p>Several years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that
<em>Twelve Men</em> was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers,
Simon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability
to furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep
my works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me
without a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at
least, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf
explained why <em>Twelve Men</em> had been discontinued and added, “I believe
that one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained
popular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles
each year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit,
thereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their
keeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to
Dreiser, 10 April 1939).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br>
The world knows Gerhart Hauptmann as dramatist, and, largely because
of the nature of some of his dramas, as poet. When, in 1912, Gerhart
Hauptmann, then fifty years of age, was awarded the Nobel prize for
literature, it was “principally for his rich, versatile and prominent
activity in the realm of the drama.” To a world which knows Hauptmann
by his “The Sunken Bell,” there is no more convenient way of
introducing a work of his which yet is not so widely known as by
saying that “The Heretic of Soana” is to Gerhart Hauptmann’s prose
fiction what “The Sunken Bell” is to his poetical dramas. (<em>Spring
1928; Fall 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1923, whose firm merged
with Viking Press in 1925. ML edition (pp. [3]–192) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates with the Huebsch half title used as a fly title.
Published July 1928. <em>WR</em> 4 August 1928. First (and probably only)
printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued April 1931.</p>
<p>The ML failed to identify the translator, Bayard Quincy Morgan. Viking
Press pointed out the oversight, and Klopfer promised to add Morgan’s
name to the next printing (Klopfer to Viking Press, 23 July 1930).
However, <em>The Heretic of Soana</em> sold poorly, and there does not appear
to have been a second printing. Copies of the first printing have been
seen with the remainder marking of a star stamped on the endpaper.</p>

<p>Text on front:<br>
It so happens that this volume, Number 150 in the Modern Library,
appears just ten years [<em>sic</em>] after the first book in the
series—Oscar Wilde’s “Dorian Gray” it was—made its appearance in the
shops. The editors feel that they can show their appreciation of the
support accorded the entire series by booklovers of America in no more
appropriate way than by publishing these reproductions of Whistler’s
beautiful art, with an understanding biography by Elizabeth Robins
Pennell, at the regular Modern Library price. (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “32
Reproductions in the Aquatone Process | With an understanding biography
by <span class="smallcaps">Elizabeth Robins Pennell</span>”. (<em>Spring
1929</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML publication. Text and illustrations printed by the “aquatone
process.” Published August 1928. <em>WR</em> 8 September 1928. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1936.</p>
<p>The ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of
the title page states: “<em>Printed by the</em> <span
class="smallcaps">aquatone process</span> <em>by</em> | <em>Edward Stern &amp;
Company, Inc.</em>”</p>
<p>There were at least two printings of <em>The Art of Whistler</em>. The
statement “<em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | 1928” appears to have been
retained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition”
statement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first
printing; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such
statements on all printings.</p>
<p>The ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’
previous biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97).
<em>The Life of James McNeill Whistler</em> by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and
Joseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B.
Lippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911.
Joseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to
edit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the
manuscript on her own.</p>
<p>Klopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the
manuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss
to determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the
author. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her
home in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his
mid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer
struggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs.
Pennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the
manuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November
1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).</p>
<p>Shortly after publication of <em>The Art of Whistler</em> Klopfer invited Mrs.
Pennell to edit a companion volume, <em>The Art of Joseph Pennell</em> (Klopfer
to Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.</p>
<p>Klopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain
before he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of <em>The
Art of Whistler</em> in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn
near our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we
don’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane,
11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s <em>Lives of the Twelve Caesars</em>
(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no
illustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.</p>

The four books of Rabelais remain forever the four gospels of the

of a forbidding morality and the rumbling pretences of its pious
advocates, there is always the wholehearted ribaldry and rollicking
laughter of Rabelais. His gigantic nonsense and his gay and lecherous
love of life give his books the stature and vitality of his own
heroes. The Modern Library version, condensed by Professor Donald
Douglas, is as faithful in spirit as it is intelligent in its
selectiveness. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML abridgment of the Urquhart-Motteux translation. Published
September 1928. <em>WR</em> 13 October 1928. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1945 following the publication of <em>The</em> <em>Complete
Works</em> <em>of Rabelais</em> (G66).</p>
<p>The ML commissioned Douglas to prepare an abridged edition of Rabelais.
The manuscript was due in May 1927, but Douglas’s work on it was held up
by a succession of bouts with influenza. There were other problems as
well. In one letter he told Cerf, “I had worked about six hours a day
for a week on Rabelais . . . and then you told me the whole thing must
be expurgated” (Douglas to Cerf, 6 October 1927). When he finally
submitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever
did in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).</p>
<p>Douglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse
Rabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells
would say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the
immense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth
or turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of
stones. By the laws of our own age it has become necessary and
obligatory” (pp. ix–x). Douglas’s edition was superseded in 1944 by
<em>The</em> <em>Complete Works</em> <em>of Rabelais</em> (G66) in an unabridged translation
by Jacques Le Clercq.</p>
<p><em>Gargantua and Pantagruel</em> ranked in the middle of the third quarter of
ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942‑October
1943.</p>
<p>The ML plates were used by Walter J. Black, Inc., for an undated

<p>Translation by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson originally published in U.S. by John
Lane, 1914, and from 1922 by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. ML edition (pp. [1–4],
7–348) printed from a duplicate set of Lane/Dodd, Mead plates with
running heads removed and original page numerals in the headline
replaced by smaller numerals placed closer to the text. Published
September 1928. <em>WR</em> 13 October 1928. First printing: 10,000 copies.
Discontinued 1 January 1939.</p>
<p>The Dodd, Mead trade edition of <em>The Revolt of the Angels</em> was an
attractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page
(text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins.
The Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid
typesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a type
page that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard
trim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem. [scan of Dodd, Mead ed.
w ML Jacket Scans file]</p>
<p>In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by
photographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the
type page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The
quality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were
higher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf
and Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an
option in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were
developed in the early part of the century, but it was not until the
1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method,
and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book
printing industry. The method would have had more use in its early days
had it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not
well enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked
lithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee, <em>Bookmaking</em>, 2nd ed., p. 136).</p>
<p>The Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd,
Mead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals
were part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page
numerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the
first line of text, and they were set in a different font that was
smaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals.
Margins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was
⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted
to the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The
result was the one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever
produced.</p>
<p><em>The Revolt of the Angels</em> sold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter.
The ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of
17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings
of 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly
before the final printing. Subsequent sales were as follows: 366 copies
(July–December 1936); 344 copies (1937); 319 copies (1938); and 256
copies (January–June 1939, after the ML edition was officially
discontinued). The figures for July 1936–June 1939 include the resale of
copies returned by booksellers; sales subject to royalty payments during
this period totaled 753 copies.</p>
<p><em>The Revolt of the Angels</em> was discontinued in 1938 because of declining
sales, shortly before the ML introduced a new and larger format designed
by Joseph Blumenthal that could have accommodated the Dodd, Mead plates
more comfortably.</p>

John Addington Symond’s [<em>sic</em>] biography is more than a study of a
unique personality; it is an incarnation of the Renaissance and an
evaluation of its most titanic symbol. In the ninety years of
Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a century was consecrated to a
burning sense of beauty, which took form in his colossal plastic
figures and the impassioned sonnets. The versatile creator of the
Sistine chapel, sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and
writer completely embodies the Carlyle-Nietzschean conception of “the
hero as artist.” (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Even more than a study of one of the most heroic personalities of
history, John Addington Symond’s [<em>sic</em>] biography of Michelangelo
becomes an evaluation of the Renaissance and its most titanic symbol.
Of the ninety years of Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a
century was consecrated to his great works of art. The unexcelled
sculptured figures and the impassioned sonnets suggest two facets of
his complex creative personality. The painter of the Sistine Chapel,
the sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and the writer
indicate the versatility of his gifts and the richness of the heritage
he has bestowed upon mankind. (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The first of modern philosophers to insist on the primacy of will over
intellect, Schopenhauer, who himself derived much of his thought from
Kant, started a movement whose influence was felt by Nietzsche, James,
Bergson and Dewey. The continuing popularity of his work, however,
rests not on his influence on other thinkers of his time or on the
logical strength of his metaphysics, but on his resonant prose, and
the accessibility to the nonacademic reader of what Irwin Edman calls,
in his introduction, a “philosophy in the old and appealing meaning of
the wisdom of life. . . . the alert, half-sad, half-cynical harvest of
a candid eye.”</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Swann’s Way</em>, the first volume of Proust’s great seven-volume
masterpiece <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>, was first published in
France in 1913, at Proust’s own expense. The most popular of his
books, it stands alone as a unique recreation of what was actually
Proust’s own childhood. Swann, the focal character, is the son of a
stockbroker and has entered into an “unfortunate” marriage. Marcel,
the narrator, remembers that his family’s guests during the early
period of his life were practically limited to Swann, who, like the
other people in Marcel’s early memories, seemed to him to be
“abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great
chestnut-tree.”</p>
<p>“If I think of it,” says Marcel at the end of <em>Remembrance of Things
Past</em>, “the substance of my experience came to me through Swann.”</p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1928</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Virginia Woolf’s vibrant sensitiveness to the casual, her unerring
susceptibility to impressions and the firm texture of her prose
combine to make <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> a novel of distinction and absorbing
interest. The events of the single day on which Clarissa Dalloway
prepares for a party become a pageant of London. By means of technique
both delicate and sure, a vivid chronicle of men and women of diverse
character unfolds itself, revealing a cross-section of English life
compressed into the flow of a few hours. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Non-pictorial jacket in light violet (210), deep reddish
orange (36) and black on white paper with title in deep reddish orange
on inset white panel on diagonal axis; author’s name in reverse and
other lettering in black, all against light violet background. Designed
by Valenti Angelo; unsigned. Front flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1925. ML edition
(pp. 3–296) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published December
1928. <em>WR</em> 12 January 1929. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued
fall 1949.</p>
<p>ML sales of <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> totaled 61,000 copies (Kirkpatrick,
<em>Virginia Woolf</em>, p. 26). <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> sold 4,271 copies during the
eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third
quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. <em>To the Lighthouse</em> (306) was in
the fourth quarter during this period with sales of 3,203 copies.</p>
<p>Lewis Miller, the RH sales manager, reviewed the jacket design that
Angelo originally submitted and asked for revisions: “Would you try to
do the lettering for the title in a little simpler fashion to increase
visibility. Also the pinkish lettering against the white is perhaps not
strong enough. Could I recommend that you think in terms of a darker ink
for the lettering?” (Miller to Angelo, 15 March 1939).</p>
<p>Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint
series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning postwar
college market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s
reprint contracts for <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>, <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, and seven
other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis,
Katherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,
Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 1,400 copies of
<em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> in stock. Klopfer estimated that it would take six
months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June
1948).</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1928\n\n## 1928\n\n### General\n\nBoni & Liveright, Inc., became Horace Liveright, Inc., on 28 May. Boni\nhad left the firm nearly nine years earlier, in July 1919.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nCerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued ten titles,\nall but one of which were from the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the\ntotal number of active titles to 148. D’Annunzio, *Maidens of the Rocks*\n(1926), which Cerf and Klopfer added shortly after they took over the\nseries, was the first title for which they had been responsible to be\ndiscontinued. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated\nhere and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s\npractice of including titles projected for January publication on fall\nlists.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles except France, *Revolt of the Angels* (163) were\npublished in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in.\n(168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). The\nfirst printing had a trim size of 6⅝ x 4½ in. (167 x 108 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nMost new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, (some\nFall titles had B or A3) and the last line of the title page as\nPUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of\nearlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages.\n\n### Binding\n\nImitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine\nlettering in gold and the Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front\ncover.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nBernhard\n\n**Jackets**\n\nSpring 1928 titles were the last published in uniform typographic jacket\nB2. A redesigned typographic jacket was introduced in September and\nmodified in October. In addition to uniform typographic jackets, a\nlimited number of titles were also available in pictorial jackets. The\noption of pictorial jackets may have been inspired by the 1928 Christmas\nGift Box, which featured pictorial jackets printed in spring 1928.\nPictorial jackets are rare; the number of titles available with\npictorial jackets as well as uniform typographic jackets is unknown. Two\nexamples are reproduced in the illustrations.\n\nUniform typographic jacket C, which was completely redesigned except for\nthe torchbearer on the spine and the horizontal bands near the top and\nfoot, was introduced in September 1928 and used on only two titles,\nRabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel (162) and France, Revolt of the\nAngels (163). Both jackets were printed on pale yellow paper; series THE\nMODERN LIBRARY appeared in the lower. The paragraph of descriptive text\nthat had been used on the front panel of ML jackets since 1917 was\ndropped completely. In its place was the title in large capitals that\ncould be read easily from a distance of five or six feet, a torchbearer\nthat was nearly twice the size of the torchbearer on uniform typographic\njacket B2, and brief descriptive text in smaller type. The jacket for\nThe Revolt of the Angels stated, “One of the five of Anatole France’s\ngreatest books available in this edition”; that of Gargantua and\nPantagruel stated, “Intelligently condensed into one volume by <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">prof. donald douglas</span> of Columbia University.”\nThe colored rules did not make the books stand out on bookstore shelves,\nand uniform jacket C was replaced the following month by uniform\ntypographic jacket D.\n\nUniform typographic jacket D, introduced with the two October titles,\nSymonds, Life of Michaelangelo Buonnaroti (164) and The Philosophy of\nSchopenhauer (165), was a significant improvement. The new jackets\ndiffered from uniform typographic jacket C in two respects. The colored\nrules near the top and foot were extended to the upper and lower edges\nof the jacket, creating colored borders 7/16 inch wide which extended\nover the front and back panels, backstrip, and jacket flaps. And the\njackets were printed in different color combinations. The borders were\nprinted in deep reddish orange, moderate blue, or moderate yellowish\ngreen; the paper stock was light greenish blue, brilliant yellow, or\npale yellow. Most booksellers displayed Modern Library books together.\nThe vivid and varied colors of the jacket borders and paper stock\nsignificantly increased the visual appeal of groups of ML books\ndisplayed in book and department stores.\n\nThe Modern Library printed new uniform jackets for the entire series,\nnot just for newly published titles. First printings of Gargantua and\nPantagruel and Revolt of the Angels, originally published in uniform\ntypographic jacket C, are also found in uniform typographic jacket D.\n\nThe text on the back panel of uniform typographic jackets C and D was\nalso revised.\n\nThe upper band which indicates the author on the front panel and spine,\ncontains the following statement on the back panel:\n\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern library</span>\n>\n> Books that have something to say\n>\n> to the Modern Mind\n>\n> The area between the upper and lower bands states:\n>\n> *How many* <span class=\"smallcaps\">modern library</span> *books*\n>\n> *have you read?*\n>\n> A complete list of the 150 books in The Modern Library series will be\n> found on the inside of the jacket. They are representative works by\n> modern authors of the first rank, supplemented by a group of books\n> that, although they were written centuries ago, are still *modern* in\n> the full sense of the word. How many of these books have you read? How\n> many are in your library? Handsome, durable, and inexpensive Modern\n> Library editions enable them to be secured at a fraction of their\n> usual cost. Jot down the numbers of volumes you desire on the coupon\n> below. Give it to your bookseller. If there is no bookseller near you,\n> the publisher will supply you.\n\nLike uniform jacket B2, a complete list of Modern Library titles is\nprinted inside uniform typographic jackets C and D.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n**Dating key**\n\n**(***Spring*) Dumas, *Three Musketeers* xApuleius, *Golden Ass*.\n(*Fall*) Apuleius, *Golden Ass* xDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf expressed interest in several titles published by Doubleday, Doran,\nincluding works by Joseph Conrad (*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Youth*,\n*Chance*, or *Nigger of the Narcissus*), Aldous Huxley (*Chrome Yellow*\nor *Antic Hay*), W. Somerset Maugham (*Of Human Bondage*, *The Moon and\nSixpence*, or *The Trembling of a Leaf*), William McFee (*Captain\nMacedoine’s Daughter*, *Command*, or *Casuals of the Sea*), and Horace\nWalpole (*Fortitude*). He offered the ML’s highest royalty—12 cents a\ncopy—on any of these books (Cerf to Russell Doubleday, 25 April 1928),\nbut Doubleday, Doran was not receptive. The Modern Library was able to\ninclude seven of these titles—*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Antic Hay*, *Of\nHuman Bondage*, *Moon and Sixpence*, *Casuals of the Sea*, and\n*Fortitude*—in the early 1930s as a result of its purchase of the Sun\nDial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint\nsubsidiary. (See the introductory matter for 1930 for more information\non the Sun Dial Library purchase.)\n\nAnother author Cerf wanted in the ML was Ernest Hemingway. He told\nHemingway, “We are very anxious indeed to add a book of yours to our\nModern Library series” (Cerf to Hemingway, 29 October 1928). The ML was\nable to secure reprint rights to *The Sun Also Rises* and *A Farewell to\nArms* in the early 1930s; *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* was\nadded to ML Giants in 1942.\n\nWhen Cerf told Sinclair Lewis that he wanted one if his books in the\nseries, Lewis replied that the decision was up to Harcourt, Brace (Lewis\nto Cerf, 1928). The ML was able to add *Arrowsmith* in 1933 and three\nadditional titles by Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBernice Baumgarten of the literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested a ML\nedition of John Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers*, which had never appeared\nin a reprint edition (Baumgarten to Cerf, 6 March 1928). Cerf, who had\npreviously declined to reprint Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*,\nreplied, “We will not be interested in doing John Dos Passos’ ‘Three\nSoldiers’ in the Modern Library. I know the book well, and though I\nthink it is an excellent piece of work, I do not feel that Dos Passos\nquite rates the Modern Library” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 7 March 1928). Cerf\nlater changed his mind. Three books by Dos Passos were published in the\nML in the 1930s: *Three Soldiers* (1932: 248), *The* *42nd Parallel*\n(1937: 307), and *U.S.A.* (1939: G42).\n\nCerf offered Harcourt, Brace an advance of $1,800 against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for reprint rights to Lytton Strachey’s *Queen\nVictoria*, provided the ML could print from Harcourt plates (Cerf to\nHarrison Smith, 21 April 1928). Harcourt, Brace declined on the grounds\nthat Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex*, published that year, would revive\ninterest in the earlier work (Harrison Smith to Cerf, 11 May 1928).\nStrachey’s *Eminent Victorians* was added to the series in 1933.\n\nCerf also wanted to include anthologies devoted to American poetry and\nEnglish poetry. Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry, 1671–1928: A\nComprehensive Anthology* (169.1), published early in 1928, was compiled\nfor the Modern Library. Cerf sought permission to reprint John\nDrinkwater’s *Anthology of English Verse* (Houghton Mifflin, 1924), but\nthe publisher rejected the offer (Curtis Brown to Cerf, 13 July 1928).\n\nKlopfer offered a $4,000 advance against a royalty of 12 cents a copy\nfor James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* (Klopfer to H. C. Latham,\nMacmillan, 27 November 1928). Despite subsequent offers, the book never\nappeared in the ML. Appleton declined Cerf’s offer of a $3,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy for Stephen Crane’s *Red Badge of\nCourage* (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928).\nThe ML finally secured reprint rights to Crane’s novel fourteen years\nlater.\n\nE. Clark Stillman suggested a volume of Heinrich Heine’s poems for the\nML and offered to do the translations (Stillman to ML, 15 June 1928). A\nreader suggested a volume of poetry by Alfred Noyes. Cerf replied to the\nlatter suggestion, “. . . the idea is a mighty good one, and we shall\ninvestigate it at once” (Cerf to Mrs. R. G. Pattern, 29 October 1928).\nNothing came of either suggestion.\n\n**Christmas gift box**\n\nFor the 1928 Christmas season the ML offered a boxed set titled *Three\nRenaissance Romances* consisting of three titles—Cellini,\n*Autobiography* (1927: 132), Merejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*\n(1928: 154), and Symonds, *Life of Michelangelo* *Buonarroti* (1928:\n164) in distinctive bindings and jackets. The bindings were brightly\ncolored Keratol, a treated book cloth stamped in a geometric pattern,\nwith the same gold stamping as other volumes of the period. The Cellini\nbinding was light greenish blue (172), Merejkowski was vivid orange\n(48), Symonds was light yellowish green (135). Each jacket had an inset\nillustration printed in black on colored paper; the jackets are\ndescribed in the entries for each title. Volumes in Keratol bindings\nhave spring 1928 jackets and fall 1928 lists at the end of the volumes,\nexcept for Cellini which has no list. The retail price of each set was\n$2.85. Orders came mainly from department stores. Cerf noted after the\nChristmas season that the boxed set had proved so popular that it would\nbe carried in stock regularly (Cerf to Desmond FitzGerald, 13 February\n1929). This does not appear to have been done, but the *Three\nRenaissance Romances* gift box was offered again during the 1929\nChristmas season.\n\n### New titles\n\nDouglas, *Old Calabria* (1928) 150\n\nZola, *Nana* (1928) 151\n\nTomlinson, *Sea and the Jungle* (1928) 152\n\nDumas, *Three Musketeers* (1928) 153\n\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (1928) 154\n\nStarrett, ed., *Fourteen Great Detective Stories* (1928) 155\n\nJoyce, *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (1928) 156\n\nO’Neill, *Emperor Jones; The Straw* (1928) 157\n\nSterne, *Tristram Shandy* (1928) 158\n\nDreiser, *Twelve Men* (1928) 159\n\nHauptmann, *Heretic of Soana* (1928) 160\n\nPennell, *Art of Whistler* (1928) 161### Discontinued\n\nNone\n\n***  \nSpring***\n\n### 150\n\n**NORMAN DOUGLAS.

(*Fall 1928*)\n\n*Jacket C*: Three French Romances gift box.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n*Jacket E:* Pictorial in dark yellowish pink (30) and moderate reddish\nbrown (43) on cream paper with head-and-shoulders illustration of a\nwoman glancing to her right; lettering in moderate reddish brown except\ntitle in dark yellowish pink outlined in moderate reddish brown, borders\nin dark yellowish pink. Signed: Newman.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Banned in England in 1888 for its so-called obscenity, *Nana* has\n> since come to be regarded the highest achievement among the novels of\n> the Naturalist school. Its author is now acknowledged as the source\n> from which the English realists and our own Frank Norris and Theodore\n> Dreiser derive their greatest influence. Regardless of the sensational\n> aspects of this work and its niche in literary history, *Nana* lives\n> as a novel by its own vigor and the incomparable skill and fidelity\n> with which it is written.

When a film version produced by Samuel Goldwyn and\nstarring the Russian actress Anna Sten was released in 1934, the ML\nurged booksellers to stock *Nana* in quantity and distributed copies of\nthe movie poster to major bookstores.\n\nSales of *Nana* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 2nd out of\n147 ML titles.

It is\n> a *tour de force* of heart-pounding relentlessness that strips naked\n> the terror-stricken soul of a Negro. *The Straw* reveals another facet\n> of Eugene O’Neill’s many-sided genius. (*Spring 1935*)\n\n*The Emperor Jones* and *The Straw* originally published by Boni &\nLiveright, 1921, in a volume with O’Neill’s *Diff’rent*. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced\nfor April 1928. *WR* 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1937. Superseded February 1937 by *The Emperor\nJones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape* (299).\n\nDudley Nichols of the *New York World* wrote the introduction after\nO’Neill declined to write it himself (Cerf to O’Neill, 7 December 1927;\nCerf to Nichols, 7 February 1928).\n\nO’Neill made several revisions in the text of *The Emperor Jones* when\nhe prepared it for *The Complete Works of Eugene O’Neill* (2 vols., Boni\n& Liveright, 1924). The most notable were the cutting of speeches by\nSmithers at the end of Scene One and the end of the play. In the revised\nversion Scene One ends as follows:\n\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">Smithers \\[</span>*Looks after him with a\n> puzzled admiration*\\]: ’E’s got ’is bloomin’ nerve with ’im, s’elp me.\n> \\[*Then angrily*.\\] Ho—the bleedin’ nigger—puttin’ on ’is bloody airs!\n> I ’opes they naps ’im an’ gives ’im an’ gives ’im what’s what!\n\nThe original version continues:\n\n> \\[*Then putting business before the pleasure of this thought, looking\n> around him with cupidity.*\\] A bloke ought to find a ’ole lot in this\n> palace that’d go for a bit of cash.

The 1972 Vintage Books edition of *The Emperor Jones,\nAnna Christie, The Hairy Ape*, which superseded the Modern Library\nedition and is printed from plates made from a new typesetting, uses the\noriginal text. The original version also appears in *Six Modern American\nPlays* (441).\n\nIn contrast, O’Neill’s *Nine Plays* (G53), published in 1941 as a ML\nGiant and printed from plates originally used by Liveright, Inc. in 1932\nand later by Random House, has the revised version of *The Emperor\nJones*. The revised version also appears in the 3-volume *Plays of\nEugene O’Neill* (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition\nwas originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951\nwhen *The Iceman Cometh* was added.\n\n*The Emperor Jones; The Straw*, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th\nbest-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928. Sales through\n1932 were as follows: 5,855 copies (1928); 2,901 copies (1929); 1,921\ncopies (1930); 1,405 copies (1931); 756 copies (1932) (Cerf to O’Neill,\n2 June 1933).\n\nThe ML paid royalties to Boni & Liveright of 10 cents a copy.\n\nO’Neill became a Random House author after the Liveright bankruptcy in\n1933. Saxe Commins, his editor at Liveright, also moved to Random House.\nIn choosing between Coward-McCann and Random House, O’Neill wrote:\n\n> Cerf . . . has drive and enthusiasm, coupled with keen shrewdness.\n> Moreover, I felt Coward was trade publisher, pure and simple—but Cerf\n> has more to his publishing than that, a love of beautiful books, an\n> appreciation for good literature, an ambition to keep his firm above\n> the level of the others, to expand only along lines of distinction.\n> That, of course, appealed strongly to me. As for background for my\n> stuff, there is no comparison. . . . Cerf has two unique things—Modern\n> Library and Random House.\n\nHe also thought Random House would offer better opportunities for\nCommins:\n\n> I feel strongly that Cerf is the better bet for your present and\n> future . . . with him, you will have a real chance to do your stuff\n> and a most congenial atmosphere. . . .

Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions\n> and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety.\n> Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of\n> temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils\n> its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete\n> and unabridged version.

Klopfer thought that its\ninclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R. \nH. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury\nthe ML abandoned after the first printing.\n\nThe omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of *Tristam Shandy*\ntraditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There\nis no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there\nis a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the\nbook by it . . .” (p. 281).\n\n*Tristram Shandy* was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the\nfirst six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales.

Discontinued fall 1934.\n\nCerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the\nrights to *Twelve Men*. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of\n$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October\n1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for\nroyalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&L for the\nuse of their plates. B&L received $200 for approving the ML reprint;\nthis appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was\ndeducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received\n$1,000 when the contract was signed.\n\nDreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the *New York Sun* (13\nApril 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken\n$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but\nMencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis\nto write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked *Twelve Men*\nvery much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf\nto Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928).\nCharles Merz of the *New York World* also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou\nof the *Chicago Daily News*, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought\nto be doing this himself” (p. v).\n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *Twelve Men* ranked 34th\namong the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of\n1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales\nfell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser\nfile) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies\n(1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421\ncopies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).\n\nSeveral years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that\n*Twelve Men* was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers,\nSimon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability\nto furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep\nmy works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me\nwithout a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at\nleast, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf\nexplained why *Twelve Men* had been discontinued and added, “I believe\nthat one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained\npopular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles\neach year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit,\nthereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their\nkeeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to\nDreiser, 10 April 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDreiser, *Free and Other Stories* (1924–1931) 106\n\nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932–1971) 230\n\nDreiser, *American Tragedy* (Giant, 1956–1968) G89\n\n### 160\n\n***GERHART HAUPTMANN.

Discontinued fall 1936.\n\nThe ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of\nthe title page states: “*Printed by the* <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">aquatone process</span> *by* | *Edward Stern &\nCompany, Inc.*”\n\nThere were at least two printings of *The Art of Whistler*. The\nstatement “*First Modern Library Edition* | 1928” appears to have been\nretained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition”\nstatement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first\nprinting; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such\nstatements on all printings.\n\nThe ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’\nprevious biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97).\n*The Life of James McNeill Whistler* by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and\nJoseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B.\nLippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911.\nJoseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to\nedit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the\nmanuscript on her own.\n\nKlopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the\nmanuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss\nto determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the\nauthor. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her\nhome in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his\nmid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer\nstruggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs.\nPennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the\nmanuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November\n1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).\n\nShortly after publication of *The Art of Whistler* Klopfer invited Mrs.\nPennell to edit a companion volume, *The Art of Joseph Pennell* (Klopfer\nto Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.\n\nKlopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain\nbefore he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of *The\nArt of Whistler* in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn\nnear our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we\ndon’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane,\n11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s *Lives of the Twelve Caesars*\n(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no\nillustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.\n\n***Fall***\n\n### 162\n\n**FRANÇOIS RABELAIS.

There were other problems as\nwell. In one letter he told Cerf, “I had worked about six hours a day\nfor a week on Rabelais . . . and then you told me the whole thing must\nbe expurgated” (Douglas to Cerf, 6 October 1927). When he finally\nsubmitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever\ndid in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).\n\nDouglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse\nRabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells\nwould say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the\nimmense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth\nor turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of\nstones. By the laws of our own age it has become necessary and\nobligatory” (pp. ix–x). Douglas’s edition was superseded in 1944 by\n*The* *Complete Works* *of Rabelais* (G66) in an unabridged translation\nby Jacques Le Clercq.\n\n*Gargantua and Pantagruel* ranked in the middle of the third quarter of\nML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942‑October\n1943.\n\nThe ML plates were used by Walter J.

(*Spring\n> 1934*)\n\nTranslation by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson originally published in U.S. by John\nLane, 1914, and from 1922 by Dodd, Mead & Co. ML edition (pp. \\[1–4\\],\n7–348) printed from a duplicate set of Lane/Dodd, Mead plates with\nrunning heads removed and original page numerals in the headline\nreplaced by smaller numerals placed closer to the text. Published\nSeptember 1928. *WR* 13 October 1928. First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nThe Dodd, Mead trade edition of *The Revolt of the Angels* was an\nattractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page\n(text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins.\nThe Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid\ntypesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a type\npage that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard\ntrim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem. \\[scan of Dodd, Mead ed.\nw ML Jacket Scans file\\]\n\nIn the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by\nphotographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the\ntype page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The\nquality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were\nhigher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf\nand Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an\noption in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were\ndeveloped in the early part of the century, but it was not until the\n1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method,\nand it was not until after World War II that it became a major book\nprinting industry. The method would have had more use in its early days\nhad it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not\nwell enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked\nlithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2nd ed., p. 136).\n\nThe Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd,\nMead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals\nwere part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page\nnumerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the\nfirst line of text, and they were set in a different font that was\nsmaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals.\nMargins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was\n⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted\nto the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The\nresult was the one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever\nproduced.\n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* sold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter.\nThe ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of\n17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings\nof 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly\nbefore the final printing. Subsequent sales were as follows: 366 copies\n(July–December 1936); 344 copies (1937); 319 copies (1938); and 256\ncopies (January–June 1939, after the ML edition was officially\ndiscontinued). The figures for July 1936–June 1939 include the resale of\ncopies returned by booksellers; sales subject to royalty payments during\nthis period totaled 753 copies.\n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* was discontinued in 1938 because of declining\nsales, shortly before the ML introduced a new and larger format designed\nby Joseph Blumenthal that could have accommodated the Dodd, Mead plates\nmore comfortably.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nFrance, *The Red Lily* (1917–1937) 7\n\nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (1917–1942) 21\n\nFrance, *Queen Pédauque* (1923–1933) 100\n\nFrance, *Thaïs* (1924–1938) 109\n\nFrance, *Penguin Island* (1933–1970; 1984– ) 253\n\n### 164\n\n***JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS.

Also the pinkish lettering against the white is perhaps not\nstrong enough. Could I recommend that you think in terms of a darker ink\nfor the lettering?” (Miller to Angelo, 15 March 1939).\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning postwar\ncollege market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s\nreprint contracts for *Mrs. Dalloway*, *To the Lighthouse*, and seven\nother titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis,\nKatherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,\nBrace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 1,400 copies of\n*Mrs. Dalloway* in stock.

A redesigned typographic jacket was introduced in September and\nmodified in October. In addition to uniform typographic jackets, a\nlimited number of titles were also available in pictorial jackets. The\noption of pictorial jackets may have been inspired by the 1928 Christmas\nGift Box, which featured pictorial jackets printed in spring 1928.\nPictorial jackets are rare; the number of titles available with\npictorial jackets as well as uniform typographic jackets is unknown. Two\nexamples are reproduced in the illustrations.\n\nUniform typographic jacket C, which was completely redesigned except for\nthe torchbearer on the spine and the horizontal bands near the top and\nfoot, was introduced in September 1928 and used on only two titles,\nRabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel (162) and France, Revolt of the\nAngels (163). Both jackets were printed on pale yellow paper; series THE\nMODERN LIBRARY appeared in the lower. The paragraph of descriptive text\nthat had been used on the front panel of ML jackets since 1917 was\ndropped completely. In its place was the title in large capitals that\ncould be read easily from a distance of five or six feet, a torchbearer\nthat was nearly twice the size of the torchbearer on uniform typographic\njacket B2, and brief descriptive text in smaller type. The jacket for\nThe Revolt of the Angels stated, “One of the five of Anatole France’s\ngreatest books available in this edition”; that of Gargantua and\nPantagruel stated, “Intelligently condensed into one volume by <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">prof. donald douglas</span> of Columbia University.”\nThe colored rules did not make the books stand out on bookstore shelves,\nand uniform jacket C was replaced the following month by uniform\ntypographic jacket D.\n\nUniform typographic jacket D, introduced with the two October titles,\nSymonds, Life of Michaelangelo Buonnaroti (164) and The Philosophy of\nSchopenhauer (165), was a significant improvement. The new jackets\ndiffered from uniform typographic jacket C in two respects. The colored\nrules near the top and foot were extended to the upper and lower edges\nof the jacket, creating colored borders 7/16 inch wide which extended\nover the front and back panels, backstrip, and jacket flaps. And the\njackets were printed in different color combinations. The borders were\nprinted in deep reddish orange, moderate blue, or moderate yellowish\ngreen; the paper stock was light greenish blue, brilliant yellow, or\npale yellow. Most booksellers displayed Modern Library books together.\nThe vivid and varied colors of the jacket borders and paper stock\nsignificantly increased the visual appeal of groups of ML books\ndisplayed in book and department stores.\n\nThe Modern Library printed new uniform jackets for the entire series,\nnot just for newly published titles.

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf expressed interest in several titles published by Doubleday, Doran,\nincluding works by Joseph Conrad (*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Youth*,\n*Chance*, or *Nigger of the Narcissus*), Aldous Huxley (*Chrome Yellow*\nor *Antic Hay*), W. Somerset Maugham (*Of Human Bondage*, *The Moon and\nSixpence*, or *The Trembling of a Leaf*), William McFee (*Captain\nMacedoine’s Daughter*, *Command*, or *Casuals of the Sea*), and Horace\nWalpole (*Fortitude*). He offered the ML’s highest royalty—12 cents a\ncopy—on any of these books (Cerf to Russell Doubleday, 25 April 1928),\nbut Doubleday, Doran was not receptive. The Modern Library was able to\ninclude seven of these titles—*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Antic Hay*, *Of\nHuman Bondage*, *Moon and Sixpence*, *Casuals of the Sea*, and\n*Fortitude*—in the early 1930s as a result of its purchase of the Sun\nDial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint\nsubsidiary. (See the introductory matter for 1930 for more information\non the Sun Dial Library purchase.)\n\nAnother author Cerf wanted in the ML was Ernest Hemingway. He told\nHemingway, “We are very anxious indeed to add a book of yours to our\nModern Library series” (Cerf to Hemingway, 29 October 1928). The ML was\nable to secure reprint rights to *The Sun Also Rises* and *A Farewell to\nArms* in the early 1930s; *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* was\nadded to ML Giants in 1942.\n\nWhen Cerf told Sinclair Lewis that he wanted one if his books in the\nseries, Lewis replied that the decision was up to Harcourt, Brace (Lewis\nto Cerf, 1928). The ML was able to add *Arrowsmith* in 1933 and three\nadditional titles by Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBernice Baumgarten of the literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested a ML\nedition of John Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers*, which had never appeared\nin a reprint edition (Baumgarten to Cerf, 6 March 1928). Cerf, who had\npreviously declined to reprint Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*,\nreplied, “We will not be interested in doing John Dos Passos’ ‘Three\nSoldiers’ in the Modern Library. I know the book well, and though I\nthink it is an excellent piece of work, I do not feel that Dos Passos\nquite rates the Modern Library” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 7 March 1928). Cerf\nlater changed his mind. Three books by Dos Passos were published in the\nML in the 1930s: *Three Soldiers* (1932: 248), *The* *42nd Parallel*\n(1937: 307), and *U.S.A.* (1939: G42).\n\nCerf offered Harcourt, Brace an advance of $1,800 against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for reprint rights to Lytton Strachey’s *Queen\nVictoria*, provided the ML could print from Harcourt plates (Cerf to\nHarrison Smith, 21 April 1928). Harcourt, Brace declined on the grounds\nthat Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex*, published that year, would revive\ninterest in the earlier work (Harrison Smith to Cerf, 11 May 1928).\nStrachey’s *Eminent Victorians* was added to the series in 1933.\n\nCerf also wanted to include anthologies devoted to American poetry and\nEnglish poetry. Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry, 1671–1928: A\nComprehensive Anthology* (169.1), published early in 1928, was compiled\nfor the Modern Library. Cerf sought permission to reprint John\nDrinkwater’s *Anthology of English Verse* (Houghton Mifflin, 1924), but\nthe publisher rejected the offer (Curtis Brown to Cerf, 13 July 1928).\n\nKlopfer offered a $4,000 advance against a royalty of 12 cents a copy\nfor James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* (Klopfer to H. C. Latham,\nMacmillan, 27 November 1928). Despite subsequent offers, the book never\nappeared in the ML. Appleton declined Cerf’s offer of a $3,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy for Stephen Crane’s *Red Badge of\nCourage* (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928).\nThe ML finally secured reprint rights to Crane’s novel fourteen years\nlater.\n\nE. Clark Stillman suggested a volume of Heinrich Heine’s poems for the\nML and offered to do the translations (Stillman to ML, 15 June 1928). A\nreader suggested a volume of poetry by Alfred Noyes. Cerf replied to the\nlatter suggestion, “. . . the idea is a mighty good one, and we shall\ninvestigate it at once” (Cerf to Mrs. R. G. Pattern, 29 October 1928).\nNothing came of either suggestion.\n\n**Christmas gift box**\n\nFor the 1928 Christmas season the ML offered a boxed set titled *Three\nRenaissance Romances* consisting of three titles—Cellini,\n*Autobiography* (1927: 132), Merejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*\n(1928: 154), and Symonds, *Life of Michelangelo* *Buonarroti* (1928:\n164) in distinctive bindings and jackets. The bindings were brightly\ncolored Keratol, a treated book cloth stamped in a geometric pattern,\nwith the same gold stamping as other volumes of the period. The Cellini\nbinding was light greenish blue (172), Merejkowski was vivid orange\n(48), Symonds was light yellowish green (135). Each jacket had an inset\nillustration printed in black on colored paper; the jackets are\ndescribed in the entries for each title. Volumes in Keratol bindings\nhave spring 1928 jackets and fall 1928 lists at the end of the volumes,\nexcept for Cellini which has no list. The retail price of each set was\n$2.85. Orders came mainly from department stores. Cerf noted after the\nChristmas season that the boxed set had proved so popular that it would\nbe carried in stock regularly (Cerf to Desmond FitzGerald, 13 February\n1929). This does not appear to have been done, but the *Three\nRenaissance Romances* gift box was offered again during the 1929\nChristmas season.",

The 1972 Vintage Books edition of *The Emperor Jones,\nAnna Christie, The Hairy Ape*, which superseded the Modern Library\nedition and is printed from plates made from a new typesetting, uses the\noriginal text. The original version also appears in *Six Modern American\nPlays* (441).\n\nIn contrast, O’Neill’s *Nine Plays* (G53), published in 1941 as a ML\nGiant and printed from plates originally used by Liveright, Inc. in 1932\nand later by Random House, has the revised version of *The Emperor\nJones*. The revised version also appears in the 3-volume *Plays of\nEugene O’Neill* (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition\nwas originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951\nwhen *The Iceman Cometh* was added.\n\n*The Emperor Jones; The Straw*, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th\nbest-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928. Sales through\n1932 were as follows: 5,855 copies (1928); 2,901 copies (1929); 1,921\ncopies (1930); 1,405 copies (1931); 756 copies (1932) (Cerf to O’Neill,\n2 June 1933).\n\nThe ML paid royalties to Boni & Liveright of 10 cents a copy.\n\nO’Neill became a Random House author after the Liveright bankruptcy in\n1933. Saxe Commins, his editor at Liveright, also moved to Random House.\nIn choosing between Coward-McCann and Random House, O’Neill wrote:\n\n> Cerf . . . has drive and enthusiasm, coupled with keen shrewdness.\n> Moreover, I felt Coward was trade publisher, pure and simple—but Cerf\n> has more to his publishing than that, a love of beautiful books, an\n> appreciation for good literature, an ambition to keep his firm above\n> the level of the others, to expand only along lines of distinction.\n> That, of course, appealed strongly to me.

Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions\n> and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety.\n> Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of\n> temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils\n> its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete\n> and unabridged version.

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is\ntraditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its\ninclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R. \nH. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury\nthe ML abandoned after the first printing.\n\nThe omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of *Tristam Shandy*\ntraditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There\nis no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there\nis a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the\nbook by it . . .” (p. 281).\n\n*Tristram Shandy* was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the\nfirst six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 158.1b.

Discontinued fall 1934.\n\nCerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the\nrights to *Twelve Men*. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of\n$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October\n1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for\nroyalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&L for the\nuse of their plates. B&L received $200 for approving the ML reprint;\nthis appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was\ndeducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received\n$1,000 when the contract was signed.\n\nDreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the *New York Sun* (13\nApril 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken\n$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but\nMencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis\nto write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked *Twelve Men*\nvery much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf\nto Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928).\nCharles Merz of the *New York World* also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou\nof the *Chicago Daily News*, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought\nto be doing this himself” (p. v).\n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *Twelve Men* ranked 34th\namong the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of\n1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales\nfell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser\nfile) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies\n(1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421\ncopies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).\n\nSeveral years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that\n*Twelve Men* was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers,\nSimon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability\nto furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep\nmy works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me\nwithout a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at\nleast, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf\nexplained why *Twelve Men* had been discontinued and added, “I believe\nthat one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained\npopular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles\neach year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit,\nthereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their\nkeeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to\nDreiser, 10 April 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDreiser, *Free and Other Stories* (1924–1931) 106\n\nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932–1971) 230\n\nDreiser, *American Tragedy* (Giant, 1956–1968) G89"

Discontinued fall 1936.\n\nThe ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of\nthe title page states: “*Printed by the* <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">aquatone process</span> *by* | *Edward Stern &\nCompany, Inc.*”\n\nThere were at least two printings of *The Art of Whistler*. The\nstatement “*First Modern Library Edition* | 1928” appears to have been\nretained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition”\nstatement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first\nprinting; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such\nstatements on all printings.\n\nThe ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’\nprevious biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97).\n*The Life of James McNeill Whistler* by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and\nJoseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B.\nLippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911.\nJoseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to\nedit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the\nmanuscript on her own.\n\nKlopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the\nmanuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss\nto determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the\nauthor. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her\nhome in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his\nmid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer\nstruggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs.\nPennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the\nmanuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November\n1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).\n\nShortly after publication of *The Art of Whistler* Klopfer invited Mrs.\nPennell to edit a companion volume, *The Art of Joseph Pennell* (Klopfer\nto Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.\n\nKlopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain\nbefore he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of *The\nArt of Whistler* in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn\nnear our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we\ndon’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane,\n11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s *Lives of the Twelve Caesars*\n(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no\nillustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.\n\n***Fall***"

There were other problems as\nwell. In one letter he told Cerf, “I had worked about six hours a day\nfor a week on Rabelais . . . and then you told me the whole thing must\nbe expurgated” (Douglas to Cerf, 6 October 1927). When he finally\nsubmitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever\ndid in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).\n\nDouglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse\nRabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells\nwould say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the\nimmense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth\nor turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of\nstones. By the laws of our own age it has become necessary and\nobligatory” (pp. ix–x). Douglas’s edition was superseded in 1944 by\n*The* *Complete Works* *of Rabelais* (G66) in an unabridged translation\nby Jacques Le Clercq.\n\n*Gargantua and Pantagruel* ranked in the middle of the third quarter of\nML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942‑October\n1943.\n\nThe ML plates were used by Walter J.

(*Spring\n> 1934*)\n\nTranslation by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson originally published in U.S. by John\nLane, 1914, and from 1922 by Dodd, Mead & Co. ML edition (pp. \\[1–4\\],\n7–348) printed from a duplicate set of Lane/Dodd, Mead plates with\nrunning heads removed and original page numerals in the headline\nreplaced by smaller numerals placed closer to the text. Published\nSeptember 1928. *WR* 13 October 1928. First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nThe Dodd, Mead trade edition of *The Revolt of the Angels* was an\nattractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page\n(text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins.\nThe Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid\ntypesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a type\npage that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard\ntrim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem. \\[scan of Dodd, Mead ed.\nw ML Jacket Scans file\\]\n\nIn the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by\nphotographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the\ntype page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The\nquality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were\nhigher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf\nand Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an\noption in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were\ndeveloped in the early part of the century, but it was not until the\n1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method,\nand it was not until after World War II that it became a major book\nprinting industry. The method would have had more use in its early days\nhad it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not\nwell enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked\nlithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2nd ed., p. 136).\n\nThe Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd,\nMead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals\nwere part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page\nnumerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the\nfirst line of text, and they were set in a different font that was\nsmaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals.\nMargins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was\n⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted\nto the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The\nresult was the one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever\nproduced.\n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* sold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter.\nThe ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of\n17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings\nof 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly\nbefore the final printing. Subsequent sales were as follows: 366 copies\n(July–December 1936); 344 copies (1937); 319 copies (1938); and 256\ncopies (January–June 1939, after the ML edition was officially\ndiscontinued). The figures for July 1936–June 1939 include the resale of\ncopies returned by booksellers; sales subject to royalty payments during\nthis period totaled 753 copies.\n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* was discontinued in 1938 because of declining\nsales, shortly before the ML introduced a new and larger format designed\nby Joseph Blumenthal that could have accommodated the Dodd, Mead plates\nmore comfortably.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nFrance, *The Red Lily* (1917–1937) 7\n\nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (1917–1942) 21\n\nFrance, *Queen Pédauque* (1923–1933) 100\n\nFrance, *Thaïs* (1924–1938) 109\n\nFrance, *Penguin Island* (1933–1970; 1984– ) 253"

ML edition\n(pp. 3–296) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published December\n1928. *WR* 12 January 1929. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued\nfall 1949.\n\nML sales of *Mrs. Dalloway* totaled 61,000 copies (Kirkpatrick,\n*Virginia Woolf*, p. 26). *Mrs. Dalloway* sold 4,271 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML titles in terms of sales. *To the Lighthouse* (306) was in\nthe fourth quarter during this period with sales of 3,203 copies.\n\nLewis Miller, the RH sales manager, reviewed the jacket design that\nAngelo originally submitted and asked for revisions: “Would you try to\ndo the lettering for the title in a little simpler fashion to increase\nvisibility. Also the pinkish lettering against the white is perhaps not\nstrong enough. Could I recommend that you think in terms of a darker ink\nfor the lettering?” (Miller to Angelo, 15 March 1939).\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning postwar\ncollege market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s\nreprint contracts for *Mrs. Dalloway*, *To the Lighthouse*, and seven\nother titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis,\nKatherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,\nBrace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 1,400 copies of\n*Mrs. Dalloway* in stock. Klopfer estimated that it would take six\nmonths for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June\n1948).\n\n#### 168b.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1928 1928 Boni & Liveright, Inc., became Horace Liveright, Inc., on 28 May. Boni\nhad left the firm nearly nine years earlier, in July 1919. Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen new titles and discontinued ten titles,\nall but one of which were from the Boni & Liveright period, bringing the\ntotal number of active titles to 148. D’Annunzio, *Maidens of the Rocks*\n(1926), which Cerf and Klopfer added shortly after they took over the\nseries, was the first title for which they had been responsible to be\ndiscontinued. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated\nhere and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s\npractice of including titles projected for January publication on fall\nlists. All new titles except France, *Revolt of the Angels* (163) were\npublished in the standard format, with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in.\n(168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). The\nfirst printing had a trim size of 6⅝ x 4½ in. (167 x 108 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). Most new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type, Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2, (some\nFall titles had B or A3) and the last line of the title page as\nPUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Reprints of\nearlier titles continued to use their original ML, Inc. title pages. Imitation leather in dark green, brown, or dark blue with spine\nlettering in gold and the Bernhard torchbearer in gold on the front\ncover. Bernhard\n\n**Jackets**\n\nSpring 1928 titles were the last published in uniform typographic jacket\nB2. A redesigned typographic jacket was introduced in September and\nmodified in October. In addition to uniform typographic jackets, a\nlimited number of titles were also available in pictorial jackets. The\noption of pictorial jackets may have been inspired by the 1928 Christmas\nGift Box, which featured pictorial jackets printed in spring 1928.\nPictorial jackets are rare; the number of titles available with\npictorial jackets as well as uniform typographic jackets is unknown. Two\nexamples are reproduced in the illustrations.\n\nUniform typographic jacket C, which was completely redesigned except for\nthe torchbearer on the spine and the horizontal bands near the top and\nfoot, was introduced in September 1928 and used on only two titles,\nRabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel (162) and France, Revolt of the\nAngels (163). Both jackets were printed on pale yellow paper; series THE\nMODERN LIBRARY appeared in the lower. The paragraph of descriptive text\nthat had been used on the front panel of ML jackets since 1917 was\ndropped completely. In its place was the title in large capitals that\ncould be read easily from a distance of five or six feet, a torchbearer\nthat was nearly twice the size of the torchbearer on uniform typographic\njacket B2, and brief descriptive text in smaller type. The jacket for\nThe Revolt of the Angels stated, “One of the five of Anatole France’s\ngreatest books available in this edition”; that of Gargantua and\nPantagruel stated, “Intelligently condensed into one volume by <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">prof. donald douglas</span> of Columbia University.”\nThe colored rules did not make the books stand out on bookstore shelves,\nand uniform jacket C was replaced the following month by uniform\ntypographic jacket D.\n\nUniform typographic jacket D, introduced with the two October titles,\nSymonds, Life of Michaelangelo Buonnaroti (164) and The Philosophy of\nSchopenhauer (165), was a significant improvement. The new jackets\ndiffered from uniform typographic jacket C in two respects. The colored\nrules near the top and foot were extended to the upper and lower edges\nof the jacket, creating colored borders 7/16 inch wide which extended\nover the front and back panels, backstrip, and jacket flaps. And the\njackets were printed in different color combinations. The borders were\nprinted in deep reddish orange, moderate blue, or moderate yellowish\ngreen; the paper stock was light greenish blue, brilliant yellow, or\npale yellow. Most booksellers displayed Modern Library books together.\nThe vivid and varied colors of the jacket borders and paper stock\nsignificantly increased the visual appeal of groups of ML books\ndisplayed in book and department stores.\n\nThe Modern Library printed new uniform jackets for the entire series,\nnot just for newly published titles. First printings of Gargantua and\nPantagruel and Revolt of the Angels, originally published in uniform\ntypographic jacket C, are also found in uniform typographic jacket D.\n\nThe text on the back panel of uniform typographic jackets C and D was\nalso revised.\n\nThe upper band which indicates the author on the front panel and spine,\ncontains the following statement on the back panel:\n\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">the modern library</span>\n>\n> Books that have something to say\n>\n> to the Modern Mind\n>\n> The area between the upper and lower bands states:\n>\n> *How many* <span class=\"smallcaps\">modern library</span> *books*\n>\n> *have you read?*\n>\n> A complete list of the 150 books in The Modern Library series will be\n> found on the inside of the jacket. They are representative works by\n> modern authors of the first rank, supplemented by a group of books\n> that, although they were written centuries ago, are still *modern* in\n> the full sense of the word. How many of these books have you read? How\n> many are in your library? Handsome, durable, and inexpensive Modern\n> Library editions enable them to be secured at a fraction of their\n> usual cost. Jot down the numbers of volumes you desire on the coupon\n> below. Give it to your bookseller. If there is no bookseller near you,\n> the publisher will supply you.\n\nLike uniform jacket B2, a complete list of Modern Library titles is\nprinted inside uniform typographic jackets C and D. 95 cents.\n\n**Dating key**\n\n**(***Spring*) Dumas, *Three Musketeers* xApuleius, *Golden Ass*.\n(*Fall*) Apuleius, *Golden Ass* xDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*. Cerf expressed interest in several titles published by Doubleday, Doran,\nincluding works by Joseph Conrad (*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Youth*,\n*Chance*, or *Nigger of the Narcissus*), Aldous Huxley (*Chrome Yellow*\nor *Antic Hay*), W. Somerset Maugham (*Of Human Bondage*, *The Moon and\nSixpence*, or *The Trembling of a Leaf*), William McFee (*Captain\nMacedoine’s Daughter*, *Command*, or *Casuals of the Sea*), and Horace\nWalpole (*Fortitude*). He offered the ML’s highest royalty—12 cents a\ncopy—on any of these books (Cerf to Russell Doubleday, 25 April 1928),\nbut Doubleday, Doran was not receptive. The Modern Library was able to\ninclude seven of these titles—*Victory*, *Lord Jim*, *Antic Hay*, *Of\nHuman Bondage*, *Moon and Sixpence*, *Casuals of the Sea*, and\n*Fortitude*—in the early 1930s as a result of its purchase of the Sun\nDial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint\nsubsidiary. (See the introductory matter for 1930 for more information\non the Sun Dial Library purchase.)\n\nAnother author Cerf wanted in the ML was Ernest Hemingway. He told\nHemingway, “We are very anxious indeed to add a book of yours to our\nModern Library series” (Cerf to Hemingway, 29 October 1928). The ML was\nable to secure reprint rights to *The Sun Also Rises* and *A Farewell to\nArms* in the early 1930s; *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* was\nadded to ML Giants in 1942.\n\nWhen Cerf told Sinclair Lewis that he wanted one if his books in the\nseries, Lewis replied that the decision was up to Harcourt, Brace (Lewis\nto Cerf, 1928). The ML was able to add *Arrowsmith* in 1933 and three\nadditional titles by Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBernice Baumgarten of the literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested a ML\nedition of John Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers*, which had never appeared\nin a reprint edition (Baumgarten to Cerf, 6 March 1928). Cerf, who had\npreviously declined to reprint Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*,\nreplied, “We will not be interested in doing John Dos Passos’ ‘Three\nSoldiers’ in the Modern Library. I know the book well, and though I\nthink it is an excellent piece of work, I do not feel that Dos Passos\nquite rates the Modern Library” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 7 March 1928). Cerf\nlater changed his mind. Three books by Dos Passos were published in the\nML in the 1930s: *Three Soldiers* (1932: 248), *The* *42nd Parallel*\n(1937: 307), and *U.S.A.* (1939: G42).\n\nCerf offered Harcourt, Brace an advance of $1,800 against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for reprint rights to Lytton Strachey’s *Queen\nVictoria*, provided the ML could print from Harcourt plates (Cerf to\nHarrison Smith, 21 April 1928). Harcourt, Brace declined on the grounds\nthat Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex*, published that year, would revive\ninterest in the earlier work (Harrison Smith to Cerf, 11 May 1928).\nStrachey’s *Eminent Victorians* was added to the series in 1933.\n\nCerf also wanted to include anthologies devoted to American poetry and\nEnglish poetry. Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry, 1671–1928: A\nComprehensive Anthology* (169.1), published early in 1928, was compiled\nfor the Modern Library. Cerf sought permission to reprint John\nDrinkwater’s *Anthology of English Verse* (Houghton Mifflin, 1924), but\nthe publisher rejected the offer (Curtis Brown to Cerf, 13 July 1928).\n\nKlopfer offered a $4,000 advance against a royalty of 12 cents a copy\nfor James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* (Klopfer to H. C. Latham,\nMacmillan, 27 November 1928). Despite subsequent offers, the book never\nappeared in the ML. Appleton declined Cerf’s offer of a $3,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy for Stephen Crane’s *Red Badge of\nCourage* (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928).\nThe ML finally secured reprint rights to Crane’s novel fourteen years\nlater.\n\nE. Clark Stillman suggested a volume of Heinrich Heine’s poems for the\nML and offered to do the translations (Stillman to ML, 15 June 1928). A\nreader suggested a volume of poetry by Alfred Noyes. Cerf replied to the\nlatter suggestion, “. . . the idea is a mighty good one, and we shall\ninvestigate it at once” (Cerf to Mrs. R. G. Pattern, 29 October 1928).\nNothing came of either suggestion.\n\n**Christmas gift box**\n\nFor the 1928 Christmas season the ML offered a boxed set titled *Three\nRenaissance Romances* consisting of three titles—Cellini,\n*Autobiography* (1927: 132), Merejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*\n(1928: 154), and Symonds, *Life of Michelangelo* *Buonarroti* (1928:\n164) in distinctive bindings and jackets. The bindings were brightly\ncolored Keratol, a treated book cloth stamped in a geometric pattern,\nwith the same gold stamping as other volumes of the period. The Cellini\nbinding was light greenish blue (172), Merejkowski was vivid orange\n(48), Symonds was light yellowish green (135). Each jacket had an inset\nillustration printed in black on colored paper; the jackets are\ndescribed in the entries for each title. Volumes in Keratol bindings\nhave spring 1928 jackets and fall 1928 lists at the end of the volumes,\nexcept for Cellini which has no list. The retail price of each set was\n$2.85. Orders came mainly from department stores. Cerf noted after the\nChristmas season that the boxed set had proved so popular that it would\nbe carried in stock regularly (Cerf to Desmond FitzGerald, 13 February\n1929). This does not appear to have been done, but the *Three\nRenaissance Romances* gift box was offered again during the 1929\nChristmas season.
