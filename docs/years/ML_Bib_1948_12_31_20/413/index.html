    "For twenty-five centuries Laotse and the principles of Taoism have had an influence on Oriental thought and life second only to Confucianism. This volume of Laotse’s complete writings, including the famous Chuangtse interpretations and commentaries, appears in an entirely new translation by Lin Yutang, who also provides an Introduction and many Notes. With its companion volume in the Modern Library,The Wisdom of Confucious(No. 7), the teachings of Laotse enrich the Western mind, offering the appealing doctrines of Taoism, so rich in humor, humility and humanity. (Fall 1948)",

    "Lin Yutang received a $1,500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter (Cerf to Lin Yutang, 14 April 1948).The Wisdom of Laotsewas a companion volume toThe Wisdom ofConfucius(312) which Lin Yutang had edited for the ML in 1938, and the ML was hoping for another runaway success. Commins described the initial sale of about 5,000 copies as “a little disappointing” (Commins to Lin Yutang, 26 May 1949).",
