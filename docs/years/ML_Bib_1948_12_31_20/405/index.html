Front flap: For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought the means by which the representative writings of Alexander Pope could be brought within the compass of a single, compact volume. Now, under the supervision of Louis Kronenberger, distinguished critic and authority on the eighteenth century, the poems, essays, odes, satires, pastorals, epigrams, epitaphs and epistles have been selected for the delight of the modern reader. Here are, complete and unabridged, “The Dunciad,” “Essay on Man,” “Essay on Criticism,” “The Rape of the Lock” and a generous offering of miscellanies. (Fall 1947) Original ML collection. Published spring 1948.WR15 May 1948. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Publication was originally announced for fall 1947 but postponed to spring 1948. Cerf hoped to schedule the volume for fall 1947 to balance a list that was going to include several modern novels (Cerf to Kronenberger, 21 January 1947). Kronenberger received royalties of 5 cents a copy. John O’Hara told Commins that the title of his novelA Rage to Live(Random House, 1949) came from a line at the top of p. 150 of Pope’sSelected Works(O’Hara to Commins, “Sunday”; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton University Library). The line “And die of nothing but a Rage to live” is from Pope’sEpistle to a Lady. 405b.
