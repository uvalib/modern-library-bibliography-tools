    "Perhaps the most powerful picture of slavery in America ever painted,Uncle Tom’s Cabinis a true American classic. Unfortunately the novel is often confused with its popular dramatization, which toured the United States for some years, reaching many people who had never read the book, and which relied on a kind of melodrama and simplification of character totally alien to the original. Thus “Uncle Tom” has become a term of opprobrium for a subservient black, whereas Uncle Tom in the novel is a man who, under the most inhumane of circumstances, never loses his human dignity.",
    "Published in 1852, the book sold over 300,000 copies in a year—a number unprecedented at that time—and was credited by Lincoln himself with helping to bring about the Civil War. Interestingly enough, although it first appeared in an abolitionist paper,The National Era, it was not intended as either propaganda or an attack on the South. Indeed, it presented some of the favorable aspects of slavery while crystallizing the sentiments of the abolitionist North. It is notable, for example, that the cruel slave owner, Simon Legree, is a New Englander, while the kindly, good-tempered St. Clare is a Kentuckyan.",
