It is a psychological study which moves with relentless speed and heartbreaking truth to its inevitable end. As drama it is tense, as a case history it is painfully accurate, as a search into the depths of the alcoholic’s mind it is terrifying. Yet as a novel it has a sobriety of purpose and a steadiness of skill attained by few writers of our time. (Spring 1948)"

Nothing could make me prouder or happier, as I believe you know already (Jackson to Cerf, 17 July 1945)."
