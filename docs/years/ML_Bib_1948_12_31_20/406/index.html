    "THE LOST | WEEKEND | BY CHARLES JACKSON |And can you, by no drift of circumstance,|Get from himwhy he puts on this confusion,|Grating so harshly all his days of quiet|With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?| Hamlet, III, i. | [torchbearer D3] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | [rule]",
    "Pp. [8], [1–2] 3–244 [245–248].  [1–8]16Binding: 7-7/16 x 5 in. (188 x 125 mm); page: 7-3/16 x 4⅞ in. (182 x 122 mm).",

    "Jacket:Non-pictorial in black and deep reddish orange (36) on cream paper with title, author and series in reverse against black background, other lettering and torchbearer in deep reddish orange. Statement on front: “Five days out of a man’s life—one of the strangest, most remarkable narratives ever written.”",
    "Front flap:",
    "A merciless and absorbing story,The Lost Weekendhas become for the victim of alcoholism what De Quincey’sThe Confessions of an English Opium Eaterhas been for the drug addict. It is a psychological study which moves with relentless speed and heartbreaking truth to its inevitable end. As drama it is tense, as a case history it is painfully accurate, as a search into the depths of the alcoholic’s mind it is terrifying. Yet as a novel it has a sobriety of purpose and a steadiness of skill attained by few writers of our time. (Spring 1948)",
    "Originally published by Farrar & Rinehart, 1944. ML edition (pp. [5]–244) printed from Rinehart plates; to accommodate the plates the ML edition was 3/16 inch taller and ⅛ inch wider than the ML’s standard format. Published spring 1948.WR29 May 1948. First (and only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.",
    "Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition ofThe Lost Weekendin 1945, but the original edition was still selling well and Farrar & Rinehart ruled out any reprint edition until after Billy Wilder’s forthcoming motion picture version starring Ray Milland and Jane Wyman had run its course. After the ML’s offer had been rejected Jackson wrote Cerf:",
    "I hope you will understand . . . how disappointed I am, because it seems to me that being chosen by the Modern Library is the nearest American equivalent to “immortality,” if I may use such a fancy word. If THE LOST WEEKEND should be able to hold your interest a few years from now, I hope you will “tap” me then for your society. Nothing could make me prouder or happier, as I believe you know already (Jackson to Cerf, 17 July 1945).",
    "Cerf replied that he hoped the ML edition could be published in late 1946 or early 1947 (Cerf to Jackson, 20 July 1945). In 1946 he announced thatThe Lost Weekendwas “ticketed for a permanent place in the Modern Library, but the date is still highly uncertain” (“Trade Winds,”SRL, 2 February 1946, p. 18).",
    "Sales of the ML edition were disappointing.The Lost Weekendwas dropped from the series after two and a half years, making it one of the ML’s shortest-lived titles. The only title that had a shorter tenure was Irving Fineman’sHear, Ye Sons(1939), which lasted in the series for twenty-six months."
