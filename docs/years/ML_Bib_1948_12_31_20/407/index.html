    "To bring within the compass of a Modern Library volume of more than 650 [±700] pages the essential thought of the “Prince of Scholastics and Doctor of the Church” is a notable contribution to philosophy, religion and education. Designed to meet the needs of students and general readers alike, this book offers St. Thomas’s teachings on God, Creation, Man, Law, Grace, Habit, Virtue and kindred subjects, derived from theSumma Theologicaand theSumma Contra Gentiles. The selections and the illuminating Introduction are by Anton C. Pegis, President of The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. (Spring 1948; [Spring 1956])",
    "Jacket B:As jacket A on coated white paper with strong orange yellow (68) instead of medium gray and vivid yellowish green (129) instead of strong red. (Fall 1963)",
    "Original ML collection derived fromBasic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, edited by Anton C. Pegis (2 vols., Random House, 1945). Published spring 1948.WR5 June 1948. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.",
    "Pegis states in the Preface: “The present volume represents selections of materials, drawn entirely fromBasic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, which Random House published in 1945. . . . I have not made my selections with an eye to the opinions of specialists; I have aimed at meeting what seemed to me the needs of the college student who is a beginner in St. Thomas. Such a student will find in this book St. Thomas’ mature views of the most crucial questions of natural theology, psychology, theory of knowledge and ethics” (p. vii).",
    "Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinaswas widely adopted in Catholic colleges as a textbook for philosophy courses, and it became one of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,129 copies, making it the second best-selling title in the series and one of five ML titles with annual sales exceeding 10,000 copies. Maugham,Of Human Bondage(199) outsold Aquinas by 434 copies;Introduction to Aristotle(396) trailed Aquinas by fifteen copies. Pegis later indicated thatIntroduction to St. Thomas Aquinasconsistently sold 15,000–18,000 copies a year and had become “unexpectedly a textbook. . . . No one planned it this way, and certainly no one anticipated such an unusual eventuality. But, what is worse, theIntroductionis an improperly organized textbook since it was never edited with such a teaching purpose in view; it was simply organized as a representative collection of Thomistic readings fromBasic Writings. As a textbook, theIntroductionneeds a wider range of selections, introductions in the fields of instruction involved, notes, bibliographies and both subject and author indices” (Pegis to Klopfer, 21 June 1963).",
    "Pegis suggested a revised edition prepared specifically for the textbook market as early as 1951. Part of his concern seems to have been to secure better financial terms for himself, but no one at Random House wanted to take such a successful title out of the ML (Klopfer to Pegis, 5 December 1951). Pegis was still talking about a textbook edition in 1963. At that time he noted that the market would be expanding sharply as the baby boom generation entered Catholic colleges and proposed turningIntroduction to Aquinasinto a textbook selling at five or six dollars with a normal royalty of 10 to 15 percent of the list price. He also offered to prepare a shorter and more general volume titledThe Aquinas Papersto replaceIntroduction to Aquinasin the ML (Pegis to Klopfer, 21 June 1963).",
    "Epstein saw no point in scrapping the ML’s plates forIntroduction to Aquinas(Epstein memo to Klopfer, 14 August 1963). Pegis then suggested raising the list price from $1.95 to $2.45 and increasing his royalty to 10 percent (Pegis to Klopfer, 27 August 1963). Epstein countered with an offer of a 5 percent royalty based on a list price of $2.45—the retail price of ML books was in the process of increasing to $2.45 in any case—and Pegis accepted (Pegis to Klopfer, 10 October 1963)."
