    "The growing importance of the economics section of the Modern Library is amply confirmed in the demand for such books as Adam Smith’sThe Wealth of Nations(G32), Karl Marx’sCapital(G26), John Strachey’sThe Coming Struggle for Power(G22), Thorstein Veblen’sThe Theory of the Leisure Class(No. 63), and others.

    "Front flap rewritten:",
    "The growing interest in books on economics reflects the demand for enlightenment on means of production and modes of distribution. Knowledge of the needs and capacities of the individual and the society in which he lives are of vital concern to everyone. Such works as Adam Smith’sThe Wealth of Nations(G-32), Karl Marx’sCapital(G-26), Thorstein Veblen’sThe Theory of the Leisure Class(No. 63),The Making of Society(No. 183) and other volumes on economics and sociology make available to the general reader the widest possible range of thought on these subjects. Essential to this library of the world’s great social and economic thinkers is Henry George’sProgress and Poverty. The advocate of the single tax here analyzes the causes and effects of industrial depression and their consequences in terms of prosperity and poverty. (Fall 1956)"
