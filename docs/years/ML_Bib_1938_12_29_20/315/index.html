    "For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have wanted to include one of Dorothy Canfield’s novels in the series. They were confronted with an embarrassment of riches. The problem was solved by asking Dorothy Canfield herself to select her favorite novel. She unhesitatingly namedThe Deepening Stream. Of all her many books of fiction it best represents her unique storytelling gift. Here she brings vividly to life the drama of a young girl who grew to womanhood through love and suffering.
