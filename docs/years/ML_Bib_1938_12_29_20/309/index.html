    "No criminologist of our time has approached Edmund Pearson for his accuracy in probing into the hidden motives and mysterious circumstances of famous homicides.Studies in Murderis the book by which he is best known. Originally, it contained analyses of the weird cases of Lizzie Borden, Benjamin Nathan, Captain Nash, Mabel Page and others.
