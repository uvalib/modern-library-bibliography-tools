Cerf then wrote to Roberts himself, offering an advance of $1,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated, “In these days and times, a $1500.00 advance is a heavy one, but I feel so confident that ARUNDEL would sell like blazes in the Modern Library series that I think the advance would be earned in far less than the usual time and that, therefore, the book would sell in the Modern Library series very steadily for many years to come” (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 May 1938).

We can get all the sound run-of-the-mill titles, but it is a different problem to find another item like our Freud or Jean Christophe to head next year’s list. This brings me around once again to the question of the Bounty trilogy. If we were to offer you $5000.00 cash on signing of the contract for an edition of 50,000 copies of the trilogy, to be published in the Spring of 1939 as a Modern Library Giant at $1.25, would you be inclined to consider the proposal? The understanding would be that after 50,000 copies had been exhausted, we could not print another edition in this format without a brand new contract with you. Frankly, I think this would be a wonderful title for the Modern Library and that it would establish the authors on a higher literary plane than they have ever occupied before (Cerf to McIntyre, 7 September, 1938)."

It aimed at political order by laying the basis for it in a moral order, and it sought political harmony by trying to achieve the moral harmony in man himself. . . . Fundamentally, it was a humanist attitude, brushing aside all futile metaphysics and mysticism, interested chiefly in the essential human relationships, and not in the world of spirits or in immortality. The strongest doctrine of this particular type of humanism, which accounts for its great enduring influence, is the doctrine that ‘the measure of man is man,’ a doctrine which makes it possible for the common man to begin somewhere as a follower of Confucianism by merely following the highest instincts of his own human nature, and not by looking for perfection in a divine ideal.”"
