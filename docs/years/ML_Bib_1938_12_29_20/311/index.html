    "Genuine compassion for his vagabonds and human flotsam gives the breath of life to John Steinbeck’s novels and makes them idylls of the lower depths.Of Mice and Menis Steinbeck at his compassionate best; it is a story movingly and forcefully told and with overtones of soaring beauty. Its first success as a national best-seller and its subsequent triumph in dramatic form have helped to place John Steinbeck in the company of the first prose writers of America. (Spring 1938)",
    "Originally published by Covici, Friede, 1937, and subsequently by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [5]–186) printed from Covici, Friede/Viking plates. Published February 1938.WR5 March 1938. First printing: Not ascertained.",
    "Cerf and Klopfer arranged the ML reprint with Covici, Friede, which had been Steinbeck’s publisher since the publication of his fourth novel,Tortilla Flat, in 1935.The close working relationship between Steinbeck and his editor Pascal Covici was comparable to those between F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway with Maxwell Perkins at Charles Scribner’s Sons. Covici, Friede failed shortly afterOf Mice and Menappeared in the ML. The firm was acquired by Viking Press, Covici became a Viking editor, and Steinbeck became a Viking author. Arrangements for the second ML printing were made with Viking Press in October 1938.",
    "There were four ML printings between October 1938 and September 1942 totaling 10,000 copies. Steinbeck’s first book with Viking Press,The Grapes of Wrath, sold 430,000 copies in less than a year and was the best-selling work of fiction for 1939 (Madison, pp. 306–7; Hackett and Burke, p. 127).",
    "WhenOf Mice and Menwas published in the ML it had to compete with a 39-cent reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books. Lewis Miller, the Random House sales manager, told one of the sales representatives: “Bennett felt strongly that the book deserved a place in the Modern Library, no matter what other editions were to be had” (Miller to Rosengren, 24 January 1938).",
    "Of Mice and Mensold 7,020 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales of all four Steinbeck titles in the ML totaled 35,975 copies during this period.The Grapes of Wrathwas the only Steinbeck novel among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

    "Of Mice and Menis the beautiful and moving story of George Milton and Lennie Small, who live—like the characters inThe Grapes of Wrath—on the fringes of American society. Sustained by the hope of someday owning a farm of their own, these two itinerant laborers arrive to work on a ranch in central California. George, who is short-tempered, relies on Lennie’s great physical strength for protection and in turn tries to keep his feeble-minded friend out of trouble. But in the end, Lennie’s fundamental weakness leads to the inevitable tragedy that Steinbeck so poignantly explores in this spare, poetic novel.",
