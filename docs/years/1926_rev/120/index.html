He wrought with a rude chisel, and from no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the giant’s foot.

The ML edition was announced for May 1925 (B&L advertisement,PW, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction failed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just bought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited England in Junebut was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he wrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a short introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s “Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I would therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction within a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than four or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of $50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6 August 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After thanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your own books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an ideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September 1925)."

One result of this is that every available fact about their personalities and lives is now familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired, never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff."

The only difference is that the Travellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the first page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other Travellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a duplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement may have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925."

During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably reflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion ofWuthering Heightsas one of the first titles in Modern Library College Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for classroom use."
