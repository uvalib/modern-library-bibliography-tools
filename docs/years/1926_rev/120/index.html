    "‘WUTHERING HEIGHTS’ was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out of homely materials. The statuary found a granite block on a solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least one element of grandeur—power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the giant’s foot. CHARLOTTE BRONTË",
    "ML edition printed from duplicate plates of the edition published in 1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. Published January 1926.WR6 February 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1978.",
    "Macaulay had agreed to write an introduction toWuthering Heightswhen the ML was published by B&L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925 (B&L advertisement,PW, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction failed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just bought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited England in Junebut was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he wrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a short introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s “Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I would therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction within a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than four or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of $50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6 August 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After thanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your own books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an ideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September 1925).",
    "A slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included in the British edition ofWuthering Heightspublished in 1926 in Jonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first paragraph of the introduction concludes with the following three sentences:",
    "There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that every available fact about their personalities and lives is now familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired, never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.",
    "In the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the words, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives is now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts at all.”",
    "Except for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are printed from identical plates. The only difference is that the Travellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the first page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other Travellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a duplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement may have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.",
    "The title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay (“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.",
    "Blue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay introduction, for a 1939 printing ofWuthering Heightsin its new reprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and sold for 39 cents a copy.",
    "Sales ofWuthering Heightsduring the first six months of 1928 placed it 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably reflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion ofWuthering Heightsas one of the first titles in Modern Library College Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for classroom use.",

    "Emily Brontë’s brooding imagination evoked as thwarted and tragic a group of human creatures as ever walked the bleak moorlands or had their existence in the dark byways of life. The barren world in which their villanies [sic] flourished forms the background for deeds as weird as they are sinister and for passions as fierce as they are persistent.Wuthering Heightsis by common consent one of the most compelling novels in the English language. It is a book compact of beauty and loveliness, hate and cruelty and heartrending pathos. (Fall 1933)Note:The misspelling of “villainies” is retained on jacket flaps at least through fall 1952.",

    "ThoughWuthering Heightswas written by a woman who remained a recluse all of her life, it is one of the most powerful and passionate novels in the English language. The romantic story of the destruction caused by the frustrated love of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, set against the moors of England, creates a rare blend of violence and beauty.",

    "The Illustrated Modern Library edition ofWuthering Heights(IML 18), published in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new typesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition ofWuthering Heightshad a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only. For the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional wood engravings for the chapter heads. SinceWuthering Heightsconsists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice and one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.",
    "New plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for subsequent printings of the regular ML edition. This appears to have been the intention, since the preliminaries for the regular ML edition ofWuthering Heights, including Macaulay’s introduction, were reset to match the rest of the text. However, the original plates were used when the regular ML edition ofWuthering Heights(120.1c) was reprinted in fall 1947. No regular ML printings with the reset text have been seen prior to 120.2a, when the Illustrated Modern Library plates were used with a new introduction by Royal A. Gettmann.",
