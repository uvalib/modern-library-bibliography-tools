So I judged ‘Moll Flanders’ to be a second Bible that all true believers should study with profit and reverence. How much more to be preferred is this simple candour of Defoe’s great novel to the suggestiveness in some of our present-day writings!” —W. H.

(Fall 1933) JacketA:Uniform typographic jacket D. Front flap: Born with the most rudimentary kind of moral sense, Moll Flanders made a career of harlotry, thievery and penitence. The book of her fortunes and misfortunes, her high misdemeanors and amorous delinquencies, remains today, as it was two hundred years ago, the liveliest and most candid record of a bawd’s progress on the primrose path. The looseness of Moll’s life in folly and wickedness points the moral that the wages of sin need not be punishment and death; sometimes penitence alone redeems the most versatile sinner. (Fall 1933) Jacket B:Pictorial in grayish yellow green (122), strong orange (50) and black on coated white paper depicting a woman with parasol and a man in background with an eyeglass and walking stick; lettering in black. Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1937; signed. Front flap as jacket A. (Spring 1939) There was a fall 1939 printing of 127.1b after the ML’s larger format was introduced. Not all ML titles could be switched immediately to the new format since jacket art that was not being replaced had to be adapted to the larger format. The two printings in spring and fall 1939 were probably small ones. The fall 1940 printing described under 127.1c was probably the first in the Blumenthal format. Copies of the fall 1939 printing in the balloon cloth format have been seen with the remainder stamp of a red star on the rear endpaper. 127.1c.

Erskine offered Schorer $150 to write the introduction; Schorer accepted the invitation but asked for $250, which he indicated was more in line with the terms offered by Rinehart Editions (Erskine to Schorer, 26 January 1950; Schorer telegram to Erskine, 30 January 1950). Erskine countered with an offer of $200 which Schorer accepted. 127.2a.

(Spring 1967)Note:Bibliography revised from 127.1d. Jacket:Fujita non-pictorial jacket in black, deep purplish red (256) and strong brown (55) on coated white paper; title and author in black ornamented lettering, ornamental flourishes in deep purplish red, strong brown and black, series in strong brown, all against white background. The somewhat crowded feel of the 127.2a jacket is corrected in the 127.2b jacket which not only is ¼ inch taller but reduces the size of the lettering and decoration by a few millimeters. Front flap: Moll Flanders, published in 1772, was among the first novels to appear in English, and contributed to the development of the novel form. It relates the autobiography of its unrestrained heroine, who was born in Newgate Prison and spent parts of her life as a harlot, a wife, a thief, a convict, and finally a prosperous penitent in the American colonies. Moll is one of the great picaresque figures in literature, whose vitality and gusto remain undiminished by the passage of time. Printed from offset plates made from a new typesetting. 127.2b.  Title page with Fujita torchbearer; 7½ inch format (1969/70) Title as 127.2a through line 15; lines 16–17: [torchbearer K] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK. Pagination, collation and contents as 127.2a.

Reissueformat(1985) DANIEL DEFOE | [title in reverse within single rules in reverse all on black rectangular panel] MOLL FLANDERS | [torchbearer N] | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK Pp. [4], 1–328 [329–332].  Perfect bound. [1] woodcut illustration of a woman reclining on a couch; [2] blank; [3] title; [4] MODERN LIBRARY EDITION | November 1985; 1–328 text; [329–332] blank. Jacket:Pictorial in strong reddish brown (40) and black on kraft paper with inset woodcut illustration by Stephen Alcorn; title in reverse on strong reddish brown panel, other lettering in black. Front flap: Born with the most rudimentary kind of moral sense, Moll Flanders made a flamboyant life of prostitution, thievery and, finally, penitence. This vivid saga of a beautiful, clever woman, her high misdemeanors and delinquencies, her varied careers as a prostitute, a charming and faithful wife, a thief and convict, remains today the liveliest, most candid record of an eighteenth-century woman’s progress through the hypocritical labyrinth of her society ever recorded. This book, written by Defoe under an assumed name, so his readers would think it an accurate journal of one woman’s life, remains a picaresque novel of astonishing vitality. Printed from the original letterpress plates with Schorer introduction and Author’s Preface omitted. Published fall 1985 at $9.95. ISBN 0-394-60530-6. Discontinued fall 1991. The letterpress plates show serious signs of wear. Some of the page numerals in the headline are particularly battered. The Modern Library reverted to letterpress printing for some volumes in the reissue format (R. D. Scudellari to GBN, interview), probably to take advantage of price breaks for using idle letterpress equipment after most book printing had shifted to offset lithography.
