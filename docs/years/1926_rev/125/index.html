Text on front: This book, at once criticism and romance, is the best introduction to the works of one of the finest intellects of our time. In France and in England it created a sensation, but for every prurient mind that, distorting the book’s intent, greeted it with accusations of indecency and blasphemy, there were a dozen readers who appreciated the depth and the nobility of M. de Gourmont’s philosophy. “A Night in the Luxembourg” is for the intelligent reader of our generation what “Mademoiselle de Maupin” was for the generation of Swinburne—“a golden book of spirit and sense.” (Spring 1926) Jacket B: Uniform typographic jacket D. (Spring 1928) Originally published in U.S. by John W. Luce & Co., 1912; new bibliographical edition published by Luce, 1919. ML edition (pp. [5]–215) printed from plates of the 1919 Luce edition. Publication announced for July 1926.WR21 August 1926. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1933. Edmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical champion of the [Symbolist] movement” (Axel’s Castle, p. 22). Cerf initially offered Luce royalties of 2 cents a copy (Cerf to John W. Luce & Co., 14 October 1925). In the end the ML paid royalties of 4 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in 1928 and two additional printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and 1931.A Night in the Luxembourgwas listed in 1931 as one of the ML’s worst-selling titles (“Notes on the Modern Library,” RH box 117, Publicity folder).
