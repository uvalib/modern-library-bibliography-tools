    "POOR WHITE tells the story of the American power that dots a vast valley with cities overnight, and builds a network of industry, making quick men rich and fearful men poor. The hero works for this force although he doesn’t like or understand it. He is a dreamy, rather stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made [sic] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s” love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is fulfilled. (Fall 1925)",

    "As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a supreme position among American novelists.Poor White, likeWinesburg, Ohio(No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world celebrated. (Spring 1934)",
    "Originally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking Press, August 1925. ML edition (pp. [1]–371) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings. Published February 1926.WR13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1939.",
    "When Anderson became a B&L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed interest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and includingPoor Whitein the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April 1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s contract with B&L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately endeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in writing, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library” (contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML beforePoor Whitecould be added to the series. It is not known whether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or after the sale.",
    "For writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML books instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925). He wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to be published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to call on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long rows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little like a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city” (ML ed., p. vi).",
    "The dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was divorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request (Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication was inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).",
    "Sales ofPoor Whiteduring the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th out of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies by April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000 copies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).",
