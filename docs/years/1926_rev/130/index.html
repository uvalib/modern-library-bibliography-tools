    "“New Grub Street” is George Gissing’s book of the heart, a chronicle of characters that he knew through the intimacy of suffering shared and defeats experienced or understood. It is called back to life today because of the insistent determination of a new age to regard Gissing as a stylist second to none, a keen analyst of motives, and an extraordinary literary figure whose inexplicable hardships stir the imagination of an age surfeited with material things. (Spring 1927)",

    "For those who cherish the dream of writing and for those who read and ponder the whole mystery of the anguish and ecstasy of authorship,New Grub Streetis a book of revelation. Not only does it expose the shifts and subterfuges of meagre talents to provide marketable stuff and the devotion and sacrifice of those who consecrate themselves to the severest of arts, but it lays bare Gissing’s own fierce struggle against vulgarity and the world’s indifference. In that sense, it is a true book of the heart. (Spring 1938)",

    "Cerf initially asked H. G. Wells to write the introduction. He told Wells thatNew Grub Streetwas “long out of print in this country, and knowing your enthusiasm for the work, I am wondering whether you will add a short introduction for us.” He offered the ML’s usual $50 fee and reminded Wells thatAnn Veronicacontinued to sell very well in the series (Cerf to Wells, 13 January 1926). Wells declined, but six years later he wrote an introduction to the fine press edition ofThe Time Machinepublished by Random House.",

    "New Grub Street, one of the first exponents of Naturalism in English literature, has been described as a cross between the works of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, and is much acclaimed for its portrait of the unsuccessful literary life in 19th century London. It is the story of Edward Reardon, a novelist whose valiant and painstaking attempts to maintain the standards of his art in the face of severe financial pressure are opposed by an unsympathetic wife. In sharp contrast to Reardon is his friend Jasper Milvain, an essayist who adjusts himself with shocking ease to currently materialistic ideals. A grimly realistic look at the hardships and compromises of the modern literary world,New Grub Streetis an underground classic.",
