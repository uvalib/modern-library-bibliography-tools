However, I believe that we could not do either of these books without getting into a serious jam with Knopf, and I would do nothing about them unless we had his definite consent” (Cerf to Baumgarten, 8 June 1927).

Therefore I should not feel happy in opposing him in any matter” (Machen to Cerf, 5 July 1926).

It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays. Shaw relaxed his opposition to inexpensive reprints on one occasion toward the end of his life. In 1946 he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday."

He wrought with a rude chisel, and from no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the giant’s foot.

The statuary found a granite block on a solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how from the crag might be elicited a head, savage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least one element of grandeur—power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from no model but the vision of his meditations. With time and labour, the crag took human shape; and there it stands colossal, dark, and frowning, half statue, half rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter, almost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss clothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close to the giant’s foot.

Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼ inch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the taller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely redesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼ inch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch format. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings. The ISBN 394-60124-6 (without the initial 0) was added to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets for previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is probably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain endpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were characteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the remainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front endpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as the 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to understand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to the 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger format."

In sharp contrast to Reardon is his friend Jasper Milvain, an essayist who adjusts himself with shocking ease to currently materialistic ideals.
