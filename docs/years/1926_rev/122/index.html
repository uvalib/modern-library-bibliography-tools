Text on front: “De Profundis” and “Papers On Prison Life,” included in this volume, were, with “The Ballad of Reading Gaol,” the last writings of Oscar Wilde. The original manuscript consists of eighty close-written pages on blue stamped prison foolscap paper; it was written at intervals during the last six months of the author’s imprisonment, when courage and hope had been crushed from his soul, and his sense of grievance against Lord Alfred Douglas had been fanned to fever heat. Frank Harris’ illuminating introduction appears exclusively in the Modern Library edition of “De Profundis.” (Spring 1926) JacketB:Uniform typographic jacket D.
