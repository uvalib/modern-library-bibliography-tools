Signed: Kidd. Front flap: Among the many suggestions sent to the editors for new additions to the Modern Library, one that recurs most frequently is for the inclusion of James Fenimore Cooper’s favorite among his Leatherstocking Tales. In response to that demand and because of the revival of interest in Cooper’s works,The Pathfinderbecomes the first of his romantic adventure novels to appear in the series. This tale of Cooper’s gallant and resourceful wilderness scout mirrors faithfully the world of Indian warfare and romance of the early American frontier. (Fall 1952) Originally published by Lea & Blanchard, 1840. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1952.WR15 November 1952. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. Cerf considered including one of Cooper’s novels in the ML in 1948 with an introduction by Sterling Lanier of Harvard University. He solicited advice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos Baker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the Hampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George Stewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard Cooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated thatThe Pathfinderwould be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper (Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favoredThe Pathfinder. The response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone a decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must admit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present seems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but I can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters I have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948). Three years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and asked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf what he thought of a Giant containingThe Deerslayer,The Pilot, andSatanstoe, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite Cooper novel. In the endThe Pathfinderwas published in the regular ML. Also in the Modern Library Cooper,Leatherstocking Saga(Giant, 1966)  G107",
