    "For several years the editors of the Modern Library have sought to include a representative yet variegated collection of Franz Kafka’s short stories in the series. Now, after long negotiations, fifteen of his best tales, selected and brilliantly introduced by Philip Rahv, editor ofThe Partisan Review, are made available to the ever-expanding circle of Kafka enthusiasts. The newly recognized master of obsessive fantasy, of symbolic narrative, stark and compelling in its reality, is represented in this volume by such memorable stories as “The Metamorphosis,” “The Great Wall of China,” “The Judgment,” “In the Penal Colony,” “The Hunter Gracchus,” “The Burrow,” and nine others of equal power and inexorable fascination. (Fall 1952)",
    "Jacket B:Fujita non-pictorial jacket in vivid reddish orange (34), vivid yellow (82) and black on coated white paper with inset black rectangular panel containing title in vivid yellow and vivid reddish orange and other lettering in reverse; series in black and torchbearer in vivid yellow below panel, all against white background.",
    "Front flap:",
    "No writer in history has illuminated the dark and fantastic side of the human soul with the clarity and perception of Kafka, and this group of stories has been selected to reflect his finest and most representative work.",
    "In his brilliant introduction to this volume, Philip Rahv writes, “Kafka so compellingly arouses in us a sense of immediate relatedness, of strong even if uneasy identification . . . because of the profound quality of his feeling for the experience of human loss, estrangement, guilt and anxiety—an experience increasingly dominant in the modern age.” Indeed, Kafka speaks to today’s world with a rarely equaled immediacy and directness of expression.",
    "These selected stories comprise fifteen of Kafka’s best-known and most typical works, including “The Metamorphosis,” “In the Penal Colony,” “The Great Wall of China,” “Investigations of a Dog,” and “The New Advocate.”Note:Ellipsis in original.",
    "Original ML collection selected fromThe PenalColony, translated by Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1946) andThe Great Wall of China, translated by Willa and Edwin Muir (Schocken Books, 1948). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1952.WR11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.",
    "The negotiations that resulted in publication ofSelected Stories of Franz Kafkatook three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’ hopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty over the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to plan a collection of thirteen stories selected fromThe PenalColonyandThe Great Wall of Chinain 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken Books appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the contract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested resuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November 1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would use other translations of the two most important stories and find other material to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).",
    "Commins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and reported:",
    "The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.",
    "I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not, whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.",
    "Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.",
    "I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to Cerf, 8 December 1949)",
    "After analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins reported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken [sic] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items. There are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents which are not protected. These would require new translation, but there would not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are convinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen negotiations with Shocken [sic]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January 1950).",
    "Kurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported that Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation which were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken proposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make a selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help arrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949). Little had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months later. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision ofThe Great Wall of Chinawith additional stories, were still forthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML selection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken to Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May 1951).",
    "Cerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the Kafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could produce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken, 16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952 Random House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the publication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great Wall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It is not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus & Young guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random House’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point Schocken capitulated.",
    "The ML edition ofSelected Stories of Franz Kakfa, reprinted by arrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared three months later.",
    "The ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received $250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been ascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of 5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two printings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders; some records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the total of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate within 20,000 copies or so.",
