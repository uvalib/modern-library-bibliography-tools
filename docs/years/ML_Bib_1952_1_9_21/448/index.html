    "The modern theatre keeps a favorite place in its repertory for such eighteenth-century plays as Gay’sThe Beggar’s Opera, Goldsmith’sShe Stoops to Conquerand Sheridan’sThe Rivals. Their gaiety, wit and charm make them as enjoyable to us as the latest Broadway hits. Equally appealing, though less frequently produced nowadays, are the other five plays in this volume. All of them make superb reading and offer great rewards from the treasury of eighteenth-century drama. Professor Ricardo Quintana, Chairman of the English Department at the University of Wisconsin, contributes an informative and penetrating Introduction. (Spring 1952)",

    "Quintana received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and selecting the plays (Stein to Quintana, 27 June 1950). The volume was originally scheduled for MLCE but appeared first in the regular ML. Textual note on p. [iv]:",
    "The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first editions, exceptThe London Merchant(sixth edition, 1735),She Stoops to Conquer(fifth edition, 1773), andThe Rivals(third edition, 1776)—these exceptions being made because the later editions show changes reliably believed to have been made by the authors.",
    "A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.",
