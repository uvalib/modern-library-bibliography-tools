Signed: K [probably Fritz Kredel]. Front flap: With a serene and classic simplicity Isak Dinesen tells of life on a plantation in Kenya. By the magic of her prose and her supreme gift as a story-teller she reveals the African landscape in all its vibrant beauty. She makes the strange ways of the country and its natives part of the reader’s own discovery and experience. Isak Dinesen’s remote farm cultivated far more than its coffee crop; it became identified with a rich personality as sensitive to the primitive people and the animal life of the Ngong Hills as it was to the ideas that stirred the outside world.

Front flap: Out of Africahas perhaps brought more Western readers who have never visited that continent closer to it than any other book. With classic simplicity and a painter’s feeling for atmosphere and detail, Isak Dinesen (Baroness Karen Blixen) tells of the years she spent from 1914 to 1931 managing a coffee plantation in Kenya. Her adventures on safaris, expeditions to Nairobi, her roles as doctor to her neighbors and as hostess to strange guests, reveal a personality as sensitive to the primitive people and the animal life of the Ngong Hills as it was to the ideas that stirred the outside world. “When you have caught the rhythm of Africa,” she wrote, “you find that it is the same in all her music.” The natives, the mountains, the wildlife and trees, all were “different expressions of one idea, variations upon the same theme.” From the vast plains where the wild beasts roam to the snows of Kilimanjaro, from the foothills with the forest behind them to the dry-low country, the home of the giraffe and rhino,Out of Africais a vibrant re-creation of the beauties of the African landscape and the ways of the land and its people. Published fall 1983 at $8.95.  ISBN 0-394-60498-9. Also in the Modern Library Dinesen,Seven Gothic Tales(1939– )  320"
