    "Of the writing of books on Hollywood there has been no end. The only one that has maintained its permanence as a document and a dramatic revelation of the drives, hopes and frustrations of the film colony isWhat Makes Sammy Run?Budd Schulberg’s chronicle of the shady opportunist in the land of flickering shadows has become part of the established folklore of America. The question in his title has been incorporated into our common language and the name of Sammy Glick has become the accepted symbol for the aggressive and ruthless hustler and careerist. For the Modern Library edition ofWhat Makes Sammy Run?the author contributes a new and illuminating introduction. (Spring 1952)",
    "Originally published by Random House, 1941. ML edition (pp. [1]–303) printed from RH plates with the dedication on p. [v] changed from “For Jigge” to “For Saxe Commins.” Published spring 1952.WR5 April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.Note:Jigge was Schulberg’s daughter by his first wife.",
    "The ML paid Schulberg royalties of 6 cents a copy. Schulberg asked that the ML edition be dedicated to Commins (Schulberg to Cerf, 11 October 1951). The introduction was originally dated October 20, 1951; Commins changed the date to one closer to publication (Commins to Schulberg, 23 October 1951). The ML edition sold 11,300 copies through the end of 1955 (Commins to Alice Hackett, 15 March 1956)."
