    "From the time of Goethe to that of Kafka and Thomas Mann, the writers of the German short story have produced some of the most enduring classics of all literature. This anthology includes not only such striking examples of contemporary writing as Kafka’s “A Country Doctor” and Mann’s “Death in Venice,” but most of the classics from the grand tradition of the German short story in the nineteenth century. Two of the tales in this volume, Heinrich Mann’s “Three-Minute Novel” and Kleist’s “Earthquake in Chile,” in new translations by Professor Lange, are presented for the first time in a popular edition. (Fall 1952)",
    "Original ML anthology supersedingGreat German Short Novels and Stories, ed. Bennett A. Cerf (256). Published December 1952.WR10 January 1953. First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on 16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the entire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.",
    "Lange suggested a revision of the ML anthologyGreat German Short Novels and Storiesafter writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’sFaustwhich appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930: 200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only collection of German narrative prose in English translation that the student is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely unsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to Stein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein to Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of contents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two exceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for economic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length of the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’sImmenseeinstead of replacing it with the author’sCarsten Curator“because it has become a ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange that “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical sketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the stories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen selections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s original anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a different translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of $500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid the cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for selections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death in Venice” (see 256).",

    "From the time of Goethe to that of Kafka and Thomas Mann, the writers of the German short story have produced some of the most enduring classics of all literature. This anthology includes not only such striking examples of contemporary writing as Kafka’s “A Country Doctor” and Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice” (in the brilliant Kenneth Burke translation), it also includes classics from the grand tradition of the German short story. Among them are Goethe’s “The Sorrows of Young Werther,” Schiller’s “The Sport of Destiny,” Kleist’s “The Earthquake in Chile” (translated for this edition by Victor Lange), Brentano’s “The Story of the Just Casper and Fair Annie,” Hoffman’s “The Cremona Violin,” Heine’s “Gods in Exile,” Keller’s “The Naughty Saint Vitalis,” Hauptmann’s “Flagman Thiel,” Schnitzler’s “A Farewell,” Rilke’s “How Old Timofei Died Singing,” and Wedekind’s “The Burning of Egliswyl.”",
    "“The balance between thought and action, good and evil, hope and despair is now perhaps more precariously suspended than ever before, and it is this disturbing but revealing modern sensibility that characterizes the stories offered in this volume by an impressive company of German writers.”",
