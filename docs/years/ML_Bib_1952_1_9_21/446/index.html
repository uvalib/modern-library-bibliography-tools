Front flap: Ben Jonson considered John Donne the first among the poets of his time. That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St. Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry and a generous selection of his prose. (Spring 1952) Original ML collection based on the contents of Donne’sComplete Poetry and Selected Prose, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952.WR5 April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. The ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from Nonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein to Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The ML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore more economical to print. The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donnewas originally scheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition was postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of $250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an additional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML. Stein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows: There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever before. (Stein to Coffin, 15 May 1951) A volume of Donne’sPoetry and Prose, ed. Frank J. Warnke, finally appeared in MLCE in 1967. 446b.  Title page with Fujita torchbearer; 7½ inch format (1969/70) Title as 446a through line 7; lines 8–9: [torchbearer K] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK. Pagination as 446a.

(Spring 1967) Jacket:Enlarged version of 446a with deep red (13) instead of dark bluish green on coated white paper. Front flap: Until this century, John Donne’s poetry was excluded from the mainstream of English literature. To his friend Ben Jonson he was “first poet in the world for some things,” but “for not keeping of accent deserved hanging.” Dr. Johnson and Dryden, each a cultural arbiter of his time, shared a low opinion of Donne’s work: according to Dryden, he “affects the metaphysics . . . in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softness of love.” But in the first three decades of this century Donne was the poet, more than any other, to whom British and American poets turned for inspiration in language and sensibility. This volume contains all of Donne’s poetry and a substantial selection from his letters and sermons, with a critical and biographical introduction by Charles M. Coffin.Note:Ellipses in original. 446c.  Reissue format; offset printing (1977) Title as 446a through line 5; lines 6–7: [torchbearer M] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK. Pagination as 446a.

Front flap: In the twentieth century, John Donne has become one of the most influential and widely read of poets, for both his love poems and his sacred verse.
