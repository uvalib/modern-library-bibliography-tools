    "The text followed in this abridgement is that edited by George Birkbeck Hill, revised and enlarged by L. F. Powell, in six volumes, published by the Oxford University Press from 1934 to 1950. A few changes in punctuation have been made to meet the exigencies of abridgment.",
    "The Powell-HillJohnsonis one of the monuments of scholarship, probablythegreat edition of any English classic. The reader who wishes to read the entireLife of Johnsonis, of course, referred to this edition. We are grateful to the Oxford University Press for their gracious permission to use the Powell-Hill text in this abridgment. [The Life of Samuel Johnsoncomprises vols. 1–4 of the Powell-Hill edition; vols. 5–6 are Boswell’sJournal of a Tour to the Hebridesand Johnson’sDiary of a Journey into North Wales.]",

    "Few men in history have ever been known as intimately as Samuel Johnson. Famous in his own time for his wit and wisdom, he has had the rare good fortune to gain a posthumous extension of personality and influence over a period of more than one hundred and sixty years. James Boswell’s boast that Johnson would “be seen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived” has been borne out in the greatest biography in the English language. To give the modern reader the spirit and substance of Johnson’s life and times, Bergen Evans, Professor of English at Northwestern University, has winnowed out the obscurities and irrelevances of the full text and kept its essence. (Fall 1952)",
    "Original ML abridgment. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25 May 1952.WR7 June 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Also published in MLCE. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.",
    "The ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge Boswell’sLife of Samuel Johnson. Pottle indicated that he was badly behind schedule with Boswell’sJournalfor McGraw-Hill and added, “I have no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’sLife of Johnson. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that to abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will buy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is that the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is, that they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of Boswell’sLife of Johnsonwill continue to be for textbook use in schools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the best offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text with a good index” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951; underlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition ofThe Life of Samuel Johnson(G2) which lacked an index.",
    "Stein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was Bergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’sTristam Shandyin MLCE (1950) and was the author ofThe Natural History of Nonsense(1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis Kronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein memo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in the project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on Johnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography,Samuel Johnson(Henry Holt, 1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have written and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29 June 1951).",
    "Stein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words. “There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and there is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment of Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein to Evans, 10 July 1951).",
    "Evans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’sLife of Samuel Johnson(G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the first 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal number of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is notoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the errors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from Malone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from the definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized its use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to about half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The permission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.",
    "Evans told Stein in a long letter:",
    "I’m enthusiastic about this project. I have cut the book down to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious significance and without having to make any changes whatever except, perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to tell you what had been omitted.",
    "What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly unknown to the common reader.",
    "Evans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts, then hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing of her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no particular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go through the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to cut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I let the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson canon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had cut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its interest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from over 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text again, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000, I believe, nothing whatever of any value or significance . . . was taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it with a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were irrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either the sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and sections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves uninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some unimportant person.”",
    "He concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything like it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . No solid thought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly readable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it might have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951; underlining in original).”",
    "Evans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952. Proofreading was done at Random House.",
