    "For a wide range of haunting moods and of forms of creative expression, turn to this volume of writings by Edgar Allan Poe. At once the master of the lyric poem of incomparable magic and the short story of brilliant inventiveness, Poe has influenced untold numbers of poets and writers, and even today’s science fiction remains greatly in his debt. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also provided notes creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet, short-story writer, literary critic and essayist. Rarely, indeed, can a single volume devoted to a single author present such memorable achievements in various fields of literary effort. (Fall 1953)",
    "Jacket B:Fujita non-pictorial jacket in moderate olive green (125), moderate brown (58) and black on coated white paper; title in reverse on moderate olive green panel at top, author in large ornamental letters in moderate brown and black, other lettering in reverse on moderate brown panel at foot.",
    "Front and back flaps:",
    "Edgar Allan Poe is one of the most original writers in American letters. His artistic penetration into the heart of things is still being analyzed and discussed with increasing awareness of its depth and complexity. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also provided notes, creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet, short-story writer, literary critic and essayist. It presents a comprehensive view of the man whose influence on American as well as European literature was profound. The art of the short story in America was significantly advanced by Poe, who also shaped the development of the detective story.",
    "Poe’s ability to blend the macabre and surreal with consummate craftsmanship has remained a memorable contribution to American literature. (Spring/Fall 1968)",
    "Original ML collection supersedingThe Best Tales of Edgar Allan Poe(112). Published in MLCE June 1951 and in the regular ML fall 1953.WRnot found. First printing: Not ascertained.",
    "Mabbott received a flat fee of $250 for writing the introduction and selecting the contents. Stein sent him an additional $100 when the collection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June 1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been determined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD ARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However, it occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we have a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poemThe Sleeperon the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in the final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He suggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether (Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950).",
    "How to Write a Blackwood Articledoes not appear inThe Selected Poetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in the introduction appears to have been cut.The Sleeperis included in its final text.",
    "“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A. Harrison’sComplete Works of Edgar Allan Poeby the kind permission of the publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed from the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case ofThe Cask of Amontillado, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In one or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but preferred by most critics. Poe was a meticulous and thorough reviser of his imaginative works, and instances of unwise revision are exceptionally rare.” (“Note,” p. xvi)",
