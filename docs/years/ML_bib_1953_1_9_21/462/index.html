Front flap: Nowhere is the brilliant, brittle world of Restoration England more faithfully mirrored than in the dramas of that period. In this new volume—for the same enjoyment now that others found then—are the best plays of those colorful years. Here are not only the deeply moving tragedies of Dryden and Otway, but, more importantly perhaps, the ageless comedies of Etherege, Congreve, Wycherley and Vanbrugh—comedies that captured the fine manners, the shimmering wit and the constant intrigue of the gay aristocratic gallants and their ladies. (Spring 1953) Original ML anthology. Published fall 1953.WR19 September 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. Harris received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and selecting the plays. Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven plays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid all but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact upon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read and enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to Harris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and recommended omittingThe Beaux’ Stratagemif only six could be published. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to addThe Rehearsal(Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the number of pages required and agreed to its inclusion. Restoration PlaysandEighteenth-Century Plays(1952: 448) were conceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected the plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using the first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe that a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to Harris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to setRestoration Playsfrom first editions of all of the plays exceptThe Rehearsal, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition (Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured photostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A textual note similar to the one quoted in the entry forEighteenth-Century Playsappears on p. [iv] ofRestoration Plays: The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first editions. The sole exception isThe Rehearsal, which is based upon the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author. A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small number of imperative stage directions have been inserted. Harris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The volume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was twice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the regular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary to Harris, 5 May 1953)."
