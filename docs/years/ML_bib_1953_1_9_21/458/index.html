(Fall 1953) Jacket:Pictorial in black, vivid red (11) and brilliant yellow (83) on coated white paper with black-and-white photograph of Shaw; lettering in vivid red and brilliant yellow except series in reverse. Front flap: For many years the editors of the Modern Library sought to include in the series a representative collection of plays by Bernard Shaw. Until now all their efforts were in vain because the author was adamant in his determination that no selection from his works could be issued during his lifetime in a reprint series. Finally, by special arrangement with Bernard Shaw’s American publishers (Dodd, Mead & Co.) and his estate, we are able to fulfill the twenty-five-year hope and offer in a single volume four of the major plays, with the famous prefaces complete and unabridged. An Introduction by Louis Kronenberger matches the brilliance and perception of the Shavian plays. (Fall 1953) Original ML collection. Published fall 1953.WR24 October 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Stein prepared a list of six of Shaw’s plays that he considered desirable for a ML collection:Arms and the Man,Candida,Major Barbara,Pygmalion,Heartbreak House, andSaint Joan. The only important play omitted, he told Cerf, wasMan and Supermanwhich had a very long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final selection, including the addition ofCaesar and Cleopatra, was probably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction (Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953). It was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure permission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight control over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of his plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his opposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to publish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s,Four PlaysandSaint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion(1956: 484). The only other volume by Shaw in the ML was his early novelAn Unsocial Socialist(15), published in the series in fall 1917. Originally published in 1887, four years before the United States extended the possibility of U.S. copyright to works by foreign authors, it was in the U.S. public domain. Also in the Modern Library Shaw,An Unsocial Socialist(1917)  15 Shaw,Saint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion(1956)  484",
