    "Countless afflicted and sorrowing people from every part of the world have found solace and inspiration in this testament to the heroism of young John Gunther who died at the age of seventeen after a gallant but losing fight against the ravages of a brain tumor. The record of his brief life, so tenderly and poignantly portrayed, is the story not so much of suffering and death, but of courage and consideration and selflessness. Besides being one of the rare consolatory books in the world’s literature, it has become immeasurably influential in the campaign to combat cancer. For this edition ofDeath Be Not Proud, John Gunther writes a new and profoundly moving account of the influences this memoir has had on the fortunate as well as the sorely stricken everywhere. (Spring 1953)",

    "As John Gunther writes in his introduction, “Death Be Not Proudis a story not merely of suffering, harrowing as that suffering was, but of courage. Most readers, I have found, think of it not so much as the account of a brilliantly promising boy’s untimely death, but of plain, simple, primal courage—heroism would not be too strong a word.”",
