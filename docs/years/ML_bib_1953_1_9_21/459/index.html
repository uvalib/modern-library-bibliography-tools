    "The novel by which Robert Penn Warren compelled immediate national attention and for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 has already established itself as one of the notable books in all American fiction. His story of Willie Stark, the power-impelled, back-country demagogue, driven and corrupted by success, is a drama of many strands. Interwoven among them all is the central figure of a rogue strong and charming and ruthless enough to seduce either a close friend or an unruly mob. For intensity of action, for an unfailing ear for native colloquialism and for insight into the character and motivations of a man drunk with the compulsion to power, there is no comparable American novel. (Spring 1953)",
    "Originally published by Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1946. ML edition (pp. [1]–464) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Harcourt, Brace edition with the dedication omitted from 459a. Published 1 September 1953.WR19 September 1953. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1973/74.",
    "The Harcourt, Brace plates were too large for the ML’s format. The ML made its own set of offset plates from the Harcourt, Brace edition and paid royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf thanked Edward Hodge of Harcourt, Brace for a royalty concession that made it possible to include the book in the ML at “a cost within reason” (Cerf to Hodge, 15 January 1953). The ML edition sold well despite competition from a Bantam paperback. There were eighteen ML impressions between September 1953 and April 1971 for a total of 113,000 copies (Grimshaw,Robert Penn Warren: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1922–79, p. 38; total number of copies corrected by GBN).",
    "Warren’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared as “A Note toAll the King’s Men” (Sewanee Review61, Summer 1953, pp. 476–80) where it was identified as “An introduction to the forthcoming Modern Library edition.”",
