    "The figure of William Blake, poet and prophet, visionary and romantic, exerts a perennial fascination for all lovers of literature. Now, to join its ever-growing representation of the great English poets, the Modern Library makes available a distinguished volume of Blake’s work, including some of his illustrations, chosen by Northrop Frye of the University of Toronto. In addition to selections from the lyrics and shorter poems, from the “prophetic books” such asThe Four Zoas,MiltonandJerusalem, there is a generous section of prose which includes letters and some epigrammatic and revealing marginalia. Professor Frye’s Introduction provides a commentary which illuminates both the simplicity of the lyrics and the difficult but consistent symbolism of the prophecies. (Spring 1953)",
    "Original ML collection. Publication originally announced for spring 1953; published fall 1953.WR19 September 1953. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74; retained in MLCE.",
    "“The definitive edition is that of Geoffrey Keynes,The Writings of William Blake(3 vols., 1925), reprinted in one volume asThe Poetry and Prose of William Blake(4th ed., 1948). The present text, with some rearrangement, reproduces Keynes’s text” (p. xxx).",
    "Frye received a flat fee of $350 for writing the introduction and selecting the contents (Stein to Frye, 16 May 1952; 29 May 1952).",
    "Frye made a series of extracts fromThe Four Zoas,Milton, andJerusalem. He told Stein, “I have a strong personal repugnance to bits-and-pieces anthologizing, and do this only because I don’t at the moment see anything better to do” (Frye to Stein, 27 September 1952). So little of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get it all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the shorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early prose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they belonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia were included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye to Stein, 5 December 1952). Frye suggested the inclusion of the illustrations (Frye to Stein, 9 June 1952). The original plan was to use ten illustrations, but the number was reduced to eight so they could be bound in as a four-leaf gathering.",
