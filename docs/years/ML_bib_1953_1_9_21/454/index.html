Jacket:Pictorial in deep yellowish pink (27) and black on cream paper with decorative illustration of reclining male and female figures separated by a lyre; title in reverse, other lettering in black. Front flap: The literature of ancient Greece has had a most pervasive influence on the culture of the Western world. It has therefore long been the purpose of the editors of the Modern Library to provide general readers with the widest possible selection from the works of Homer, Pindar, Sappho and other great poets of antiquity, in the best available prose or verse translations. This volume preserves the rich heritage of Greek song and revives the legends of the great warriors and lovers who inspired them. (Fall 1952) Original ML anthology. Publication announced for fall 1952; published spring 1953.WR4 April 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969. Hadas received a flat fee of $1,000 for his editorial work and paid the cost of permissions and secretarial services out of his fee. The contract was signed 24 January 1952; the manuscript (except for the introduction) was delivered three months later. Kenneth Rexroth disliked the volume. He told the RH editor David McDowell: “Honest—that ML Greek Poets is awful. ‘Dedicated to proving the proposition that Western European literature is founded on the work of a number of vulgar sentimentalists who wrote illiterate doggerel.’ As somebody once said. Don’t these classics professors haveanytaste at all?” (Rexroth to McDowell, 1 May 1953). Sales totaled 12,984 copies by spring 1958. An internal RH memo indicated in 1968 thatThe Greek Poetscould not be shifted to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series, because of permissions problems. A decision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November 1968)."
