Jacket:Predominantly non-pictorial in light greenish gray (154) and black on coated white paper with lettering in black except “HEGEL” in title and torchbearer in reverse; decorative drawing of branches of leaves below title. Front flap: The enormous influence Hegel has exercised on modern politics and philosophy, on social science, anthropology and psychology demands an examination and evaluation of his most important works, so presented and annotated as to make them comprehensible in themselves and in their relationship to the contemporary world. The essence of Hegelian thought is offered in this volume, with the clarification of Professor Friedrich’s interpretation, so that Hegel’s conceptions of history, philosophy, logic, politics, aesthetics, law and justice are faithfully and conveniently set forth for the scholar and general reader.The Philosophy of Hegelbecomes another addition to the Modern Library program of books of the basic writings of such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Nietzsche and many others. (Fall 1953) Original ML collection. Published fall 1953.WR24 October 1953. First printing: Not ascertained. Friedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a copy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his edition ofThe Philosophy of Kant(422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14 December 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the job” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to the ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a devout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept. think of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late 1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly all of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations about its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead (Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951). Friedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of selections fromThe Philosophy of Historyand about fifty pages ofLectures on AestheticsandPhilosophy of Right and Law. The translation of the main part ofThe Philosophy of Historyis based on the John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in 1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that he was having to do more work on the translations than he originally hoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952). In the first printing the selections from the Introduction toThePhilosophy of History(460a, pp. [1]–43) are from “a translation made by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor, and published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)” (“Note,” p. [2]). Beginning with the second printing the selections from the Introduction (460b, pp. [1]–43) are “translated by Carl J. Friedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind permission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p. [2]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first printing and resetting pp. [1]–42 has not been ascertained. Friedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold reasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and gratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to Klopfer, 18 January 1960). 460b.
