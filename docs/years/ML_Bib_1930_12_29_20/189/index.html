Without abatement, it arouses the senses and numbs them, clutches at the heart and makes it beat faster, while it unfolds one of the greatest ghost stories of all time.The Lesson of the Masterportrays the inevitable penalties imposed on those who cherish a dream of perfection. It reveals Henry James as an incomparable story-teller and stylist. (Fall 1933)"

Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26 November 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to write an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March 1929)."

Broun’s introduction, dated January 1930, makes no reference toThe Lesson of the Master. The ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed publication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both works entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying royalties of 2 cents a copy."
