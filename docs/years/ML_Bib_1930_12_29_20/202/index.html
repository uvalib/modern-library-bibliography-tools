Jacket:Pictorial in strong brown (55) and black on coated white paper depicting man with hat in left profile; borders in strong brown (top) and black (foot), lettering in black. Signed: EMcKK (E. McKnight Kauffer). (Fall 1930) Originally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton (2 vols., 1909). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published October 1930.WR8 November 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. In its advertising the ML emphasized, “This book has been available only in two bulky volumes, that sold for ten dollars and over” (PW118, 16 August 1930, p. 574). Shortly after the ML edition appeared Cerf authorized Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran reprint subsidiary, to make a duplicate set of the ML’s plates for a fee of $1,000. Garden City was planning to publishThe Mediciunder its Star Dollar Books imprint (Cerf to Robert de Graff, Garden City, 30 December 1930). No evidence of a printing in Star Dollar Books or any other Doubleday imprint has been found. Charles Boni used the ML plates in 1930 for a single printing ofThe Mediciin the format the ML would adopt the following year for the new ML Giants series. Later that year Cerf and Klopfer bought the remaining stock from A. & C. Boni and sold it along with a printing ofThe Education of Henry Adamsthat they had produced in a similar format. The books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.” An illustrated edition ofThe Medici(G8), printed from plates of the regular ML edition, was published in ML Giants, 1933–49. The Mediciwas one of several titles that were omitted from a comprehensive ranking of ML sales for the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. The regular ML edition sold 3,300 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. 202b.

Front flap: The legends which have clustered about the most notable family in history are as various as the imaginations and prejudices of historians. Sinister crimes, magnificent liberalities, prodigal sponsorship of the arts, religious and orgiastic excesses have been attributed indiscriminately to the Medicis. It remained for G. F. Young to sift the proven facts from the exaggerations and to present a history so authentic and yet so colorful that its truth is more enthralling than all the fictions the centuries have allowed to accumulate around the most fabulous family of the Renaissance.
