    "Jacket:Pictorial in dark bluish green (165) and black on cream paper with stylized illustration of a face in left profile, a book, a skull, and a figure riding a lion; borders in dark bluish green, lettering in black. Signed: Loeffel. (Fall 1930)",

    "Fortitudewas one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML secured reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf told the press agent Lynn Farnol that Walpole received the highest advance against royalties that the ML had ever paid (Cerf to Farnol, 14 May 1941), but the amount was not indicated—and of course the advance would have been paid to Doubleday, Doran, which would have split it with Walpole.",
    "Cerf was unhappy with the appearance of the first printing. The plates, he told Doubleday, “are lousy, and we need some new ones” (Cerf to Robert de Graff, Garden City Pub. Co., 5 November 1930). When he sent a copy of the first printing to Walpole he apologized for its appearance and indicated that Doubleday had promised to supply new plates for subsequent printings (Cerf to Walpole, 26 November 1930).",
    "Fortitudewas in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

    "In the whole imposing list of novels written by Hugh Walpole there is none that has reached and maintained the popularity ofFortitude. The absorbing interest of its romantic story, its enthusiasm and its conviction make of it a rare phenomenon among books in an epoch of uncompromising realism. That it is Mr. Walpole’s favorite among all his novels can be readily understood. He says of it: “Fortitudeis a romance—a fairy-tale about a young man who very naively believed in almost everything.” (Fall 1934)",
    "Printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. The plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. First printing from the new plates: 5,000 copies.",
    "All subsequent ML printings were from the new plates. The second and third printings from these plates in September 1934 and April 1936 were for 2,000 copies each. Sales declined significantly by the 1960s; 1967 sales were 600 copies.",
