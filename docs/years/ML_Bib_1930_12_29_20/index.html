In 1930 it included fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy.

Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, the big New York department stores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them at sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to 60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned the idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were being offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55 percent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big account in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but Cerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J. Smalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931)."

We pay 10¢ a copy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first payment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract.

The ‘philosophy’ of Plato is clearly not a philosophy of the schools; his drama is profounder in theme and more comprehensive in range than the constricted little toys of the stage. For those who have not learned with Plato that philosophy is the love of wisdom rather than the pronouncement of truth, there is considerable mystification in a thinker whose thoughts are all suggestions, whose suggestions are often playful, and who will not, despite the attempt of more than one serious critic, be crammed into a neat and lifeless system. The reader is haunted, too, by the perturbed sense that, though these dialogues are full of endless charm as poetic and ironic drama, they are clearly more than the by-play of a gifted writer. The further one reads the more deeply does one come into the presence of the profoundest and most serious issues of human existence. What on its winning surface is the spirited conversation between Socrates and a group of attractive young Athenian aristocrats, closely read, stirs one profoundly to a consideration of the nature of good and evil, of reality, of the paramount mystery of the human soul.”\t—"
