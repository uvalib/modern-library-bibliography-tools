    "More than a record of an adventure in solitude,Wildernessis a book that re-creates the wonder and the tranquillity of an untracked world. The hand and heart and mind of a distinguished artist combine, in prose and pictures, to convey the topography and the moods, the changing vistas and the dramatic silences of the sub-Arctic region. Rockwell Kent’s text, embellished by more than fifty pictures from his pen, has the excitement of a quest that attains the nearest paradise man can hope for on earth. (Spring 1934)",
    "Originally published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1920, in a volume measuring approximately 11½ x 8 in. (280 x 200 mm). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the original introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second Preface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. [v] of the Putnam edition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in the volume. Published December 1930.WR27 December 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.",
    "The Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The announcement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition, Rockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important revisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations that appear in the six dollar edition” (PW118, 16 August 1930, p. 574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored “two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in the fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently would not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go so quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear under the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:",
    "“Guter Mond, du gehst so stille",
    "Durch die Abend Wolken hin.”",
    "The ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s smaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the Putnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by about a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all of the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the title page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam binding.",
    "The ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to Angus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized $1.49 reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was planning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not consulted about the $1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of the ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Kent bought 240 copies of the discontinued ML edition at twenty-five cents each (Kent to Cerf, 8 June 1939).",
