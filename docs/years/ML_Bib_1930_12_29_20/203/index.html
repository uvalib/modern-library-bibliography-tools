Cerf expressed the hope thatPoint Counter PointandAntic Haycould remain in the ML “for a long time to come” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939). Harper’s considered publishing the titles in full-priced editions at $2.50 and was concerned about the income it could expect from the ML editions. Unless the income was substantial, Hoyns indicated, the ML editions “might turn out to be a very unprofitable arrangement from our point of view” (Hoyns to Klopfer, 17 March 1939)."

Shortly before the meeting Klopfer wrote directly to Huxley, who was a personal friend: “Help, help, Harper’s are threatening to take POINT COUNTER POINT and ANTIC HAY away from us. These two books belong in the Modern Library and it would be a crime not to have them available in a cheaper edition. . . . Could you influence the Harper office in any way in our favor? I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can make a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a strong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive reprint, rather than just in the $2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to Huxley, 20 March 1939)."
    },
    {
      "#text": "Klopfer’s appeal appears to have been successful. Following the lunch Klopfer sent Hoyns new five-year contracts for the books. ThePoint Counter Pointcontract called for the ML to pay a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least 5,000 copies after three years."

The ML was allowed to sell out its stock on hand, which consisted of 4,400 copies (Epstein to Olson, 9 August 1965). The ML edition was out of stock by summer 1967."
