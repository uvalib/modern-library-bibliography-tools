    "Readers, critics and commentators have foundFaustinexhaustible in its new and illuminating riches. For a century and a quarter it has held its place among the world’s treasures. The variety and beauty of its plan and the depth of its implications give it the immortality for which its central character bargained with his soul. Faust remains the personification of humanity, tempted and tormented, groping toward the light. Of the fifty translations of the masterpiece, Bayard Taylor’s, in the original metres, most completely retains Goethe’s intention and spirit. (Fall 1933)",

Stein noted that he wanted to drop three items by Taylor: the preface to Part I, which dealt with problems of the translation, the introduction to Part II, which was a general commentary, and the poem “An Goethe.” He suggested that anything pertinent in Taylor’s preface and introduction should be included in Lange’s introduction (Stein to Lange, 27 January 1950).",
