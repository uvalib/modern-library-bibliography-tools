    "The irrepressible H. L. Mencken cuts loose at his favoritebêtes noireswith diabolical relish. He swings his bludgeon at matters divine and terrestrial, and, in passing, he thwacks the sit-spots of the respected and the revered, or bestows here and there an ungrudging accolade on the few who have attained the stature of titans. Prohibition, politics, pacifism, big business, beauty and birth control are among the targets for his shafts. In all,Selected Prejudicesis a bristling and mordant commentary on the variegated world we live in. (Fall 1933)",
    "Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [5]–166) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for July 1930.WR6 September 1930. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January1936.",
