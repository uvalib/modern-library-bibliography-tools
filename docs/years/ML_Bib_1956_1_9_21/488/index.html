    "THE GREEK | COMMONWEALTH | Politics and Economics | in Fifth-Century Athens | by Alfred Zimmern | Montague Burton Professor of International Relations | in the University of Oxford; Fellow and late Tutor of | New College | Die Griechen sind, wie das Genie,einfach: deshalb | sind sie die unsterblichen Lehrer. | The Greeks are like Genius, simple: that is why they are | the immortal teachers. | NIETZSCHE | [torchbearer D7] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK",

    "Front flap:",
    "The Greek Commonwealthis a vivid account of Athens during its Golden Age—the time of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes, of Pericles and Themistocles, of Herodotus and Thucydides, of Socrates and Protagoras. It was the time, too, in which art and architecture reached unsurpassed heights: the time of the Parthenon and Acropolis.",
    "In few periods of human history have so much achievement, so much creative genius, so much epochal decision been concentrated as in fifth-century Athens. No understanding of the Western heritage is complete without knowledge of this stirring hour in the history of mankind. (Fall 1956)",
    "Originally published in England by Clarendon Press, 1911; 5th ed. published by Oxford University Press, 1931. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published October 1956.WR5 November 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "The ML paid Oxford University Press royalties of 7½ cents a copy on all copies sold in the U.S. and 7½ percent of the net sums received on all copies sold at export. Stein told Cerf thatThe Greek Commonwealthwas “one of the classic works on Greek history. This is an account of Athens during the fifth century when art, poetry and drama reached their highest state. Although it is primarily a political and economic account, it seems to me to be one of the clearest pictures of Greece in its finest day” (Stein memo to Cerf, 10 June 1955). Stein also talked to Klopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford University Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered that we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’sThe Greek Commonwealthand we should like very much to include it in the Modern Library” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955).",
    "An internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with Oxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transferThe Greek Commonwealthto Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A decision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in as small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don Singer, 19 November 1968)."
