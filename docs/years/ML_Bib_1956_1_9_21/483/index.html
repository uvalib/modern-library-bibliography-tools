    "Few poets in the history of English literature were gifted with a greater range of theme and style than Tennyson. He wrote in many forms, in many moods—and in his poetry he tried to cope with a world of shaken beliefs and uncertain values. “In the essential nature of his idealism and his disillusioned melancholy, his pervading sense of irreparable loss,” writes Professor Bush in the Introduction, “he is very much our contemporary, the poet of an age of anxiety.” (Spring 1956)",
    "Original ML collection. Published spring 1956.WR17 March 1956. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.",
    "Originally published 1951 in MLCE and five years later in the regular ML. Stein offered Bush a flat fee of $250 to write the introduction and select the contents, with the manuscript due by 30 September (Stein to Bush, 28 June 1950). Bush was behind schedule on a book he was working on and replied that could not meet the September deadline (Bush to Stein, 30 June 1950). Stein was flexible, and Bush accepted on the condition that he would submit the manuscript as soon as he could (Bush to Stein, 16 July 1950). The ML paid him an additional $50 for a student assistant. The manuscript was delivered in mid-October 1950. Bush received an additional $100 whenSelected Poetry of Tennysonwas added to the regular ML (Stein to Bush, 1 March 1956).",
    "The text was set from the Cambridge Edition,The Complete Poetical Works of Tennyson,edited by W. J. Rolfe (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1898) with “a few silent corrections” (Introduction, p. xix).",
