    "Bernard Shaw has been called “the liveliest and, in many ways, the youngest intellect of the century.” This estimate is fully supported by the three “problem” plays in this volume:",

    "ANDROCLES AND THE LION, a brilliant exploration of the varieties of faith—a perennial favorite of Shaw admirers.",
    "Often disconcerting and irreverent, Shaw never fails to be thought-provoking in his charmingly witty way. The Modern Library takes pride in adding these plays to those already available inFour Plays by Bernard Shaw(ML 10). (Spring 1956)",

    "Saint Joan, Shaw’s ironic study of Joan of Arc as a woman who had to be killed because the world was not yet ready for a saint, is considered by many to be his best play and has a title role that continues to challenge leading actresses.",
    "Major Barbara, the story of the daughter of a wealthy munitions manufacturer who joins the Salvation Army to defy her father, preaches the still timely lesson that poverty is the root of all evil.",
    "Androcles and the Lionis an unexpectedly hilarious, if biting, satire on the early Christians.",
