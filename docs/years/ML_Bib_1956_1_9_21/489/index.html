JacketA:Non-pictorial on coated white paper with calligraphic lettering in strong greenish blue (169), strong red (12) and black. Front flap: These are the stories that John O’Hara likes best. Each of them reflects his unique insight into the complex, aimless, frustrated lives of his characters—the smart, the savage, the disillusioned, the bitter, the ordinary. Varied in mood, time and place, these stories show with an over-riding compassion the pathos and humor of men and women when seen with a sharp eye and heard with a keen ear. Readers already familiar with some of O’Hara’s writings—Appointment in Samarra,Ten North Frederick,A Rage to Live,Pal Joey, the stories inThe New Yorker, and others—can look forward to reading and re-reading in this book thirty-two of the finest stories by one of America’s most distinguished writers. (Fall 1956) Jacket B:Fujita non-pictorial jacket in brilliant violet (206) and vivid reddish orange (34) on coated white paper; series and Fujita “ml” symbol in vivid reddish orange at top, first four words of title in brilliant violet, inset circular panel at foot in vivid reddish orange with “John O’Hara” in brilliant violet and other lettering in reverse, all against white background and within single rule frame in brilliant violet. Front flap with first paragraph as jacket A and second paragraph as follows: “This book offers thirty-two of the finest stories by one of America’s most distinguished writers.” (Fall 1967 format) Original ML collection. Published October 1956.WR5 November 1956. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990. O’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he liked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections:The Doctor’s Son and Other Stories(Harcourt, Brace, 1935),Files on Parade(Harcourt, Brace, 1939),Pipe Night(Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1945) andHellbox(Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything fromPal Joey(Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out with Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on O’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the 32 stories in the ML collection were fromPipe NightandHellbox. O’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which concluded: Most of them [the stories] were written in the twenty years from 1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories forThe New Yorkerthan any other author. Aloofness is not one of my characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well, damn their eyes. I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection, Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli,O’Hara Concern, p. 233). The foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended deleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it (Weil, Gotshal & Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955). Cerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to persuade him to tone down his language: Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time, I promise never to mention the matter again. I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence, “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment. This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly concerned even remembers? I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and, furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. [Harold] Ross, who was Editor of the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead; [Brendan] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like. I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands, several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of your position that they will overlook the stories themselves. There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956). There is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably telephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf immediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an introduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956). There were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli,John O’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography, p. 216). 489b.
