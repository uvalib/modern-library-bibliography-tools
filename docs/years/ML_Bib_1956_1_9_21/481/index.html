    "Few writers, if indeed any, surpass Voltaire in versatility and enduring vitality. Novelist, poet, dramatist, literary critic, philosopher, historian, scientist, political essayist: Voltaire was all these—and always with brilliance of wit and lucidity of style.",
    "The most representative figure of the Age of Enlightenment, he remains after two centuries an abundant fountainhead of good sense and of memorable enjoyment to every reader. This immortal talent is richly represented in this volume, edited by Haskell M. Block of the University of Wisconsin with a stimulating introduction on the importance of Voltaire to our own times.

    "“I have attempted to provide an indication of Voltaire’s range and complexity by selecting those works which have most clearly become of a vital part of our intellectual and artistic heritage. . . . The text of this edition has been prepared in the hope of making some improvement over previous English versions. All of the selections are complete. There are no excerpts of letters or parts of chapters. . . . It is hoped that the translations in this collection will help to make a beginning toward an accurate edition of Voltaire in English. In every section of the volume I have provided new translations wherever they were necessary. I should add that the translations from Voltaire’sNotebooksare the first from that work to appear in an English edition. . . . Where older translations have been used, they have been thoroughly revised. In particular, for all of the fiction exceptCandide, I have modernized the version of Robert Bruce Boswell. The translation ofCandideis by Richard Aldington. I am especially grateful to Martyn P. Pollack for the selections from his excellent version ofThe Age of Louis XIV, and to Floyd Gray for his assistance in the translating of Voltaire’s correspondence.” (Editorial Note, pp. xxi–xxii)",

    "The highly unusual story of a young man booted from Paradise,Candideis Voltaire’s most famous novel as well as a scorching indictment of the philosophy of Liebnitz [sic], which was summed up by Voltaire in the thought: “All is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.” Candide’s tutor, the philosophic Dr. Pangloss, is the embodiment of this unlikely theory, maintaining it in spite of the most blatant evidence to the contrary. The young Candide is expelled from the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh for making love to the Baron’s daughter, Cunégonde; and thereafter he, Pangloss and Cunégonde embark on what develops into a long series of adventures. Sometimes together, usually apart, in various corners of the earth, they endure a brutal succession of the most unfair and calamitous events conceivable. Eventually they settle down together on a little farm. Candide marries Cunégonde, now grown ugly as a radish, and tells himself often, “We must cultivate our garden.”",
