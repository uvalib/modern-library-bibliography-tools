Signed: Freund Lurye. Front flap: “As time passes,” writes John Gassner, “one name among the post-Ibsen dramatists leads all the rest.” That one is Anton Chekhov, whose major plays are presented here in the remarkably sensitive and skillful translations of Stark Young. For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp and poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding, these plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Chekhov world famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most revered. (Fall 1956) Original ML collection supersedingThe Plays of Anton Tchekov, translated by Constance Garnett (193). Published October 1956.WR5 November 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1986. Young received a $900 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on all copies sold in the U.S. and 5 percent of the net sums received from all copies sold at export. He received an additional $100 for writing the introduction. A year before Chekhov’sBest Playswas published Stein had reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern Library were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer regarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the excellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,The Cherry Orchard,The Three Sisters,Uncle Vanya, andThe Sea Gull. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to Lois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights; there seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this stage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange for the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of course go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo to Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!” With the Young translation of Chekhov,Best Playsthe ML reverted to the spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript of her preface toThe Plays of Anton Tchekov(1930: 193)was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). 487b.

(Spring 1967) Jacket:Enlarged version of 487a with Fujita “ml” symbol on front and Fujita torchbearer on spine. Front flap: Chekhov’s reputation as a founder of modern drama rests on the four plays in this volume. So revolutionary were these plays in their simplicity and naturalness of form, subject, and dialogue, that to produce them required a new school of acting, and a new Russian theater. Immediately popular in Russia, Chekhov’s plays soon were produced all over Europe. So purely original that they could not be imitated, these plays, with Ibsen’s, laid to rest the outmoded forms of European theater, opening it to innovation in all areas. Today they are as popular as ever. 487c.  Reissue format (1978) Title as 487a except line 9: [torchbearer M]. Pagination as 487a.  Perfect bound.
