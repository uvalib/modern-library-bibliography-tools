    "Few areas of world literature are as little known to English-speaking readers as Spanish fiction. Yet none is more highly regarded by those who have had the opportunity to explore it. The sixteen stories selected for this volume by Angel Flores represent some of the best prose fiction of modern times and include the work of such old masters as Alarcón and Unamuno as well as the work of younger writers now living in Spain or in exile. The editors of the Modern Library are pleased to add this volume to the rich coverage of great literature now in the series. (Spring 1956)",
    "Original ML anthology. Published May 1956.WR28 May 1956. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "Flores received a flat fee of $500 for editing the volume and writing the introduction. Sales totaled 6,720 copies by spring 1958."
