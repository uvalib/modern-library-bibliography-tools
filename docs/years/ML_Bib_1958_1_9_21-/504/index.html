[6], [1–2] 3–277 [278–282].  [1–9]16 [1] half title; [2] blank; [3] title; [4]First Modern Library Edition|Copyright, 1945, 1946, 1951, by J. D. Salinger; [5] dedication; [6] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–277 text; [278–279] ML Giants list; [280–282] blank. (Fall 1958) Jacket:Non-pictorial in black and strong brown (55) on coated white paper with title and series in black and author in strong brown, all against white background. Front flap: This is the story of Holden Caulfield, a sixteen-year-old boy who, on being dropped by his prep school, decides to spend three days in New York before reporting home. The events of those three days and nights, told in the boy’s own words, form more than a dramatic story. They are the means by which Salinger skillfully portrays the thoughts and feelings of a young boy standing alone and unsure on the threshold of manhood. “Mr. Salinger’s novel,” said Lewis Vogler in theSan Francisco Chronicle, “is funny, poignant, and in its implications, profound. It is literature of a very high order.” The editors of the Modern Library are pleased to include this novel, which is already widely regarded as a twentieth-century classic. (Fall 1958) Originally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1951. ML edition (pp. [5]–277) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published October 1958.WR13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained but probably around 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64. The ML paid Little, Brown a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958 that he wanted to publishThe Catcher in the Ryeand Salinger’sNine Stories(516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already available in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at all. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups that patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8 January 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a period of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no photograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to approve the jacket copy. Printings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000 and 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962). In the following table ML sales ofCatcher in the RyeandNine Storieschart Salinger’s popularity with precision. Table: ML sales of Salinger’sCather in the RyeandNine Stories, 1958–63 Salinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts forCatcher in the RyeandNine Storiesnot be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’ termination notice forCatcher in the Ryeand indicated that the ML would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to Klopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to Salinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important books in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified a manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000 copies ofCatcher in the Ryeand over 37,000 copies ofNine Storiesand asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another three years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963). There is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in July that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no more printings ofCatcher in the Rye(Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July 1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is included in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer 1964 stock list. The ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering hope that Salinger might change his mind.Catcher in the RyeandNine Storieswere listed inPublishers’ Trade List Annualthrough 1965 and continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through 1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new titles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number ofCatcher in the Rye, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 whenFour Contemporary French Plays(598) was published as ML 90. Also in the Modern Library Salinger, Nine Stories(1959–1964)  516"
