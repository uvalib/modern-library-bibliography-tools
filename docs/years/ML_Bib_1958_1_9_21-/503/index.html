    "Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s finest writers of short stories and plays whenThe Young Lionsappeared. The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented, and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of mind.”",
    "Time has proved their judgments right, for this engrossing novel of men at war is in fact a testament of our century. It is the story of modern man in a moment of extreme ordeal, dramatically told by an acutely sensitive creative writer. The editors of the Modern Library are proud to include it as a work of distinguished and enduring achievement. (Spring 1958)",

    "WhenThe Young Lionswas published in 1948, Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s foremost short story writers and playwrights. But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short stories,” wroteThe Saturday Review. The story of three young men—a Nazi, a Jew, and an American—The Young Lionstakes place bestween [sic] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wroteThe New York Herald Tribune, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been reconfirmed many times.",
