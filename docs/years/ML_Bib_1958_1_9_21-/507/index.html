Front flap: “I hope I shall be able to confide in you completely,” Anne Frank wrote on the opening page of her diary, “as I have never been able to do in anyone before, and I hope that you will be a great support and comfort to me.” What follows is the story of an experience told with such sensitivity and warmth that no reader finishes the book without resolving to read it again. Anne Frank, her sister, and her parents, along with four others, shared a small hiding place in an old building in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation. Her vivid account of their experiences and feelings during the two fearful years before their discovery—written with rare insight, humor, and intimacy—is one of the classics of our times.
