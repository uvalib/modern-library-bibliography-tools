Knopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the Modern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason Epstein as a Random House editor.  Epstein had started Anchor Books at Doubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books pioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other publishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a brilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the publishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who also admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and difficult to work with."

Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for Modern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern Library itself."

                  "#text": "Despite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of the series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another person, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have saved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have accelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital up-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been abandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or because to do the job right would have been too expensive for the potential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of contemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s image as a series of indisputably significant books."

In the past, the Modern Library had always been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial success had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series might have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at a minimum."
