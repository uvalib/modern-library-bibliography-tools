    "Few men have been more widely read—and more misinterpreted—than Jonathan Swift. He did, it is true, call himself a misanthrope and many readers have been quick to regard him solely as a brooding, embittered critic of mankind.",
    "Actually, he was an intensely loyal, warm person in his private life and an active, ardent participant in worldly affairs, using his great satiric pen with positive effects on many controversial issues. Readers ofGulliver’s Travelsalready know that the narrative charm of that book is merely one aspect of a work infinitely rich in observation and wisdom. And the broad variety of matters that engaged Swift’s brilliantly incisive mind is fully represented in the many other masterpieces of prose and poetry in this volume. (Spring 1958)",

    "One of the unique books of world literature, GULLIVER’S TRAVELS describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship’s surgeon, first to Lilliput, a land inhabited by tiny people whose diminutive size renders all their pompous activities absurd; next to Brobdingnag, a republic of giants who are amused when Gulliver tells them about the glories of England; then to Laputa and its neighbor Lagado, peopled by quack philosophers and scientists; and finally to the land of the Houhynhnms, where horses behave with reason and control men, known as Yahoos, who behave like animals. A savage satire on man and his institutions, written with great wit and invention,Gulliver’s Travelshas captivated readers for the past two centuries. This volume also includes the three other Swift masterpieces:A Tale of a Tub,The Battle of the BooksandA Modest Proposal.",
