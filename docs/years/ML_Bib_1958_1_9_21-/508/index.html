With unsurpassed realism, he depicts their gradual moral and physical degeneration. This “fast-moving, brilliantly conceived study of unbridled brute passion,” as Professor Zulli describesCousin Bettein his Introduction, is added to the Modern Library with pride because it is without doubt one of the great books of our culture.
