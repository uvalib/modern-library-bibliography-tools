<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1958</h1>
<h2>1958</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A.
Knopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the
Modern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason
Epstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at
Doubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books
pioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other
publishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a
brilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the
publishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who
also admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and
difficult to work with.</p>
<p>Part of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an
independent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library,
which Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make
his fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after
several years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for
Modern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern
Library itself.</p>
<p>Despite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of
the series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another
person, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have
saved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have
accelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital
up-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been
abandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or
because to do the job right would have been too expensive for the
potential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of
contemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s
image as a series of indisputably significant books.</p>
<p>Epstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a
change from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the
Modern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had
always been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial
success had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series
might have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at
a minimum.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Nine titles were added and six were discontinued. Swift’s <em>Gulliver’s
Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books</em> (1931) was superseded
by Swift’s <em>Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings.</em> This brought the
list of available titles to 312.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with
the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.
The binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset
panels in black on the front cover and spine.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>

jackets: 383.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Moses Hadas suggested a ML reprint of the edition of ten plays of
Euripides that he and John Harvey McLean had translated (Dial Press,
1936), but Penguin Books and New American Library had both recently
published inexpensive new translations and Jason Epstein thought the ML
should wait (Epstein to Hadas, 14 November 1958). In the end the ML
reprinted the University of Chicago Press’s <em>Complete Greek Tragedie</em>s,
edited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore (4 vols., 1959; ML reprint,
7 volumes, 1960–63). Eric Bentley suggested a book of six Lope de Vega
plays (Bentley to Epstein, 16 November 1958). Klopfer rejected a
suggestion to publish a new edition of <em>Democracy in America</em> as a ML
Giant (Klopfer to Lerner, 13 November 1958).</p>

“With Descartes philosophy made a fresh start,” says Professor Norman
Kemp Smith in his Introduction to this book. “A new set of problems
had arisen, and it is owing to the manner in which he faced these
problems that he has been called ‘the father of modern philosophy.’”</p>
<p>In this volume of selected writings, recently translated by Professor
Smith, the reader will find all that is important and enduring in
Descartes’ philosophy. Here is all the evidence necessary to show why
Descartes is regarded as a founder of scientific method and a major
figure in the history of human thought.</p>

This thoroughly enjoyable collection is almost a biography of Damon
Runyon, the boy who grew up in the West, rode the rods, knew what the
inside of jails was like, wrote sports, reported abroad, and became
Mr. Broadway. Here are represented the wide range of his experiences
and of his writing—early Westerns and sketches of “folks back home”
with vivid titles like <em>The Wooing of Nosey Gillespie</em> and <em>At Dead
Mule Crossing</em>; or tales, like <em>The Informal Execution of Soupbone
Pew</em>, picked up in the hobo jungles. From his days as a newspaper
reporter and syndicated columnist come accounts like <em>The Main Event</em>,
sports verse like <em>A Handy Guy Like Sande</em>, and affectionate sketches
of “ordinary” people like those of Joe and Ethel Turp or My Old Man.
And finally, from Runyon’s great days as a Broadway chronicler, we
have Hot Horse Herbie, Nicely Nicely, Gentleman George and their
fantastic cronies, speaking again in these pages the peculiar
vernacular now immortalized as Runyonese. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

Few men have been more widely read—and more misinterpreted—than
Jonathan Swift. He did, it is true, call himself a misanthrope and
many readers have been quick to regard him solely as a brooding,
embittered critic of mankind.</p>
<p>Actually, he was an intensely loyal, warm person in his private life
and an active, ardent participant in worldly affairs, using his great
satiric pen with positive effects on many controversial issues.
Readers of <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> already know that the narrative charm
of that book is merely one aspect of a work infinitely rich in
observation and wisdom. And the broad variety of matters that engaged
Swift’s brilliantly incisive mind is fully represented in the many
other masterpieces of prose and poetry in this volume. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

One of the unique books of world literature, GULLIVER’S TRAVELS
describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship’s
surgeon, first to Lilliput, a land inhabited by tiny people whose
diminutive size renders all their pompous activities absurd; next to
Brobdingnag, a republic of giants who are amused when Gulliver tells
them about the glories of England; then to Laputa and its neighbor
Lagado, peopled by quack philosophers and scientists; and finally to
the land of the Houhynhnms, where horses behave with reason and
control men, known as Yahoos, who behave like animals. A savage satire
on man and his institutions, written with great wit and invention,
<em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> has captivated readers for the past two
centuries. This volume also includes the three other Swift
masterpieces: <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>, <em>The Battle of the Books</em> and <em>A
Modest Proposal</em>.</p>

Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s finest
writers of short stories and plays when <em>The Young Lions</em> appeared.
The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented,
and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent
stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the
enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be
read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of
mind.”</p>
<p>Time has proved their judgments right, for this engrossing novel of
men at war is in fact a testament of our century. It is the story of
modern man in a moment of extreme ordeal, dramatically told by an
acutely sensitive creative writer. The editors of the Modern Library
are proud to include it as a work of distinguished and enduring
achievement. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

When <em>The Young Lions</em> was published in 1948, Irwin Shaw was already
widely recognized as one of America’s foremost short story writers and
playwrights. But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical
response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He
reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense
of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short
stories,” wrote <em>The Saturday Review</em>. The story of three young men—a
Nazi, a Jew, and an American—<em>The Young Lions</em> takes place bestween
[<em>sic</em>] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross
fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wrote <em>The New York
Herald Tribune</em>, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of
American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been
reconfirmed many times.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
This is the story of Holden Caulfield, a sixteen-year-old boy who, on
being dropped by his prep school, decides to spend three days in New
York before reporting home. The events of those three days and nights,
told in the boy’s own words, form more than a dramatic story. They are
the means by which Salinger skillfully portrays the thoughts and
feelings of a young boy standing alone and unsure on the threshold of
manhood.</p>
<p>“Mr. Salinger’s novel,” said Lewis Vogler in the <em>San Francisco
Chronicle</em>, “is funny, poignant, and in its implications, profound. It
is literature of a very high order.” The editors of the Modern Library
are pleased to include this novel, which is already widely regarded as
a twentieth-century classic. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>

<p>The ML paid Little, Brown a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents
a copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958
that he wanted to publish <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> and Salinger’s <em>Nine
Stories</em> (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already
available in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at
all. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups
that patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8
January 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a
period of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no
photograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to
approve the jacket copy.</p>
<p>Printings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000
and 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and
10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962).

<p>Salinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for <em>Catcher in
the Rye</em> and <em>Nine Stories</em> not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’
termination notice for <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and indicated that the ML
would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to
Klopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to
Salinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important
books in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified
a manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000
copies of <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and over 37,000 copies of <em>Nine Stories</em>
and asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another
three years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963).</p>
<p>There is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in
July that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no
more printings of <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July
1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is
included in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer
1964 stock list.</p>
<p>The ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s
books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering
hope that Salinger might change his mind. <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and <em>Nine
Stories</em> were listed in <em>Publishers’ Trade List Annual</em> through 1965 and
continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through
1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new
titles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of <em>Catcher in
the Rye</em>, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when <em>Four
Contemporary French Plays</em> (598) was published as ML 90.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
This book is guaranteed to give you all fifty-seven varieties of
laughter—everything from the side-splitting belly-laugh to the soft
inner ripple.</p>
<p>These stories are all about Jeeves, the most fabulous gentleman’s
gentleman ever invented. From behind his inscrutable facade, the
incomparable Jeeves—confessor, savior, confidant—sagely guides the
destinies of Bertie Wooster and his friends. And when things get out
of hand, as they invariably do, it is Jeeves who tactfully assumes
control to settle matters with his customary incredible ingenuity.</p>
<p>For this edition, John W. Aldridge has written an excellent
introduction which discusses Wodehouse’s talent—a talent that
transforms all readers into devotees. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>

October 1958. <em>WR</em> 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Aldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to
Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be
making new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that
it would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to
Aldridge, 19 July 1957).</p>
<p>Wodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he
would be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in <em>Carry
On, Jeeves!</em> were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML
used most of the first Jeeves book and all of <em>Very Good, Jeeves</em>. He
also suggested updating several references in the stories and changing
the title to <em>A Gathering of Jeeves</em> (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August
1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked
Wodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that
he weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that
for Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also
asked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories.
“Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period
and . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary
confusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent
admirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title <em>Selected
Stories</em>. “The latter [<em>A Gathering of Jeeves</em>] may sound a little bit
better, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell
best when they state very clearly what the book contains, without
reaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August
1957).</p>
<p>Wodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s
introduction was written for the ML but also appeared in <em>New World
Writing</em>, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92.</p>

The writings of Immanuel Kant represent the high-water mark of modern
philosophy. Few men have had as broad and profound an influence as he
did. Josiah Royce, for example, described Kant as “the thinker upon
whom more than upon any other center, modern thought turns as upon a
fulcrum.”</p>
<p>The sheer bulk of Kant’s <em>Critique</em>—in many ways his central work—has
often deterred readers. Now, Norman Kemp Smith, in this authoritative
and new translation, provides a skillfully abridged edition from which
all minor and repetitive parts have been omitted. The editors of the
Modern Library are pleased to include it as one of the great books
that all readers will want to own. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>

Anne Frank was born in Frankfort, Germany on June 12, 1929. “As we are
Jewish, we emigrated to Holland in 1933,” Anne writes in her diary,
which she received on her thirteenth birthday. In July 1942 she and
her family were forced to take refuge with four others in a back
apartment in Amsterdam. There they remained until August 4, 1944, when
the <em>Grüne Polizei</em> made a raid on the “Secret Annexe” and all the
occupants were arrested and sent to German and Dutch concentration
camps. In March 1945, two months before the liberation of Holland,
Anne died of typhoid in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Only
her father, Otto Frank, survived, and it was he who saw that Anne’s
diary was published in 1947.</p>
<p>Written with rare insight, humor and intimacy, <em>The Diary of a Young
Girl</em> is one of the classics of our time. It has inspired a play and
has been a bestseller in almost every known language. To hundreds of

<em>Cousin Bette</em> is, in the opinion of many critics, one of Balzac’s
finest novels—if not, indeed, his finest.</p>
<p>Paris during the last century comes alive in this novel as Balzac
unfolds the dramatic story of men and women driven by greed, hatred,
lust, envy, and ambition. With unsurpassed realism, he depicts their
gradual moral and physical degeneration. This “fast-moving,
brilliantly conceived study of unbridled brute passion,” as Professor
Zulli describes <em>Cousin Bette</em> in his Introduction, is added to the
Modern Library with pride because it is without doubt one of the great
books of our culture. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1958\n\n## 1958\n\n### General\n\nIn 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A.\nKnopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the\nModern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason\nEpstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at\nDoubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books\npioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other\npublishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a\nbrilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the\npublishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who\nalso admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and\ndifficult to work with.\n\nPart of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an\nindependent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library,\nwhich Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make\nhis fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after\nseveral years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for\nModern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern\nLibrary itself.\n\nDespite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of\nthe series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another\nperson, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have\nsaved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have\naccelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital\nup-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been\nabandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or\nbecause to do the job right would have been too expensive for the\npotential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of\ncontemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s\nimage as a series of indisputably significant books.\n\nEpstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a\nchange from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the\nModern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had\nalways been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial\nsuccess had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series\nmight have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at\na minimum.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nNine titles were added and six were discontinued. Swift’s *Gulliver’s\nTravels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (1931) was superseded\nby Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings.* This brought the\nlist of available titles to 312.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine.\n\n### Price\n\n$1.65### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Descartes, *Philosophical Writings* xBalzac, *Cousin Bette*;\nGiants through G81 (=fall 1958); jackets: 380. (Fall) Balzac, *Cousin\nBette* xAuden, *Selected Poetry*; Giants through G81 (=spring 1958);\njackets: 383.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nMoses Hadas suggested a ML reprint of the edition of ten plays of\nEuripides that he and John Harvey McLean had translated (Dial Press,\n1936), but Penguin Books and New American Library had both recently\npublished inexpensive new translations and Jason Epstein thought the ML\nshould wait (Epstein to Hadas, 14 November 1958). In the end the ML\nreprinted the University of Chicago Press’s *Complete Greek Tragedie*s,\nedited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore (4 vols., 1959; ML reprint,\n7 volumes, 1960–63). Eric Bentley suggested a book of six Lope de Vega\nplays (Bentley to Epstein, 16 November 1958). Klopfer rejected a\nsuggestion to publish a new edition of *Democracy in America* as a ML\nGiant (Klopfer to Lerner, 13 November 1958).\n\n### New titles\n\nDescartes, René, *Philosophical Writings* (1958) 500\n\nRunyon, Damon, *Treasury* (1958) 501\n\nSwift, Jonathan, *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings* (1958) 502\n\nShaw, Irwin, *Young Lions* (1958) 503\n\nSalinger, J.

First printing: Not ascertained but probably\naround 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64.\n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958\nthat he wanted to publish *The Catcher in the Rye* and Salinger’s *Nine\nStories* (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already\navailable in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at\nall. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups\nthat patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8\nJanuary 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a\nperiod of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no\nphotograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to\napprove the jacket copy.\n\nPrintings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000\nand 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and\n10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962).\nIn the following table ML sales of *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* chart Salinger’s popularity with precision.\n\nTable: ML sales of Salinger’s *Cather in the Rye* and *Nine Stories*,\n1958–63\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>CATCHER IN THE RYE</td>\n<td>NINE STORIES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Year ending</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/59</td>\n<td>7,171</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/60</td>\n<td>9,915</td>\n<td>7,966</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/61</td>\n<td>9,935</td>\n<td>4,680</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/62</td>\n<td>23,963</td>\n<td>14,142</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/63</td>\n<td>14,014</td>\n<td>10,478</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>TOTAL</td>\n<td>64,998</td>\n<td>37,266</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSalinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for *Catcher in\nthe Rye* and *Nine Stories* not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’\ntermination notice for *Catcher in the Rye* and indicated that the ML\nwould have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to\nSalinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important\nbooks in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified\na manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000\ncopies of *Catcher in the Rye* and over 37,000 copies of *Nine Stories*\nand asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another\nthree years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963).\n\nThere is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in\nJuly that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no\nmore printings of *Catcher in the Rye* (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July\n1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is\nincluded in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer\n1964 stock list.\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of *Catcher in\nthe Rye*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when *Four\nContemporary French Plays* (598) was published as ML 90.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSalinger*, Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516\n\n### 505\n\n**P.

First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nAldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to\nHiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be\nmaking new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that\nit would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to\nAldridge, 19 July 1957).\n\nWodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he\nwould be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in *Carry\nOn, Jeeves!* were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML\nused most of the first Jeeves book and all of *Very Good, Jeeves*. He\nalso suggested updating several references in the stories and changing\nthe title to *A Gathering of Jeeves* (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August\n1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked\nWodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that\nhe weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that\nfor Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also\nasked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories.\n“Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period\nand . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary\nconfusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent\nadmirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title *Selected\nStories*. “The latter \\[*A Gathering of Jeeves*\\] may sound a little bit\nbetter, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell\nbest when they state very clearly what the book contains, without\nreaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August\n1957).\n\nWodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s\nintroduction was written for the ML but also appeared in *New World\nWriting*, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92.\n\n### 506\n\n**IMMANUEL KANT. CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON. 1958–1970.

  "general": "In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A.\nKnopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the\nModern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason\nEpstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at\nDoubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books\npioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other\npublishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a\nbrilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the\npublishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who\nalso admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and\ndifficult to work with.\n\nPart of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an\nindependent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library,\nwhich Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make\nhis fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after\nseveral years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for\nModern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern\nLibrary itself.\n\nDespite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of\nthe series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another\nperson, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have\nsaved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have\naccelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital\nup-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been\nabandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or\nbecause to do the job right would have been too expensive for the\npotential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of\ncontemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s\nimage as a series of indisputably significant books.\n\nEpstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a\nchange from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the\nModern Library in earlier days.

  "generalFirst": "In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A.\nKnopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the\nModern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason\nEpstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at\nDoubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books\npioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other\npublishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a\nbrilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the\npublishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who\nalso admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and\ndifficult to work with.",

(*Fall 1958*)\n\nOriginally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1951. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–277) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published October 1958.\n*WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained but probably\naround 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64.\n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958\nthat he wanted to publish *The Catcher in the Rye* and Salinger’s *Nine\nStories* (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already\navailable in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at\nall. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups\nthat patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8\nJanuary 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a\nperiod of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no\nphotograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to\napprove the jacket copy.\n\nPrintings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000\nand 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and\n10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962).\nIn the following table ML sales of *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* chart Salinger’s popularity with precision.\n\nTable: ML sales of Salinger’s *Cather in the Rye* and *Nine Stories*,\n1958–63\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>CATCHER IN THE RYE</td>\n<td>NINE STORIES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Year ending</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/59</td>\n<td>7,171</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/60</td>\n<td>9,915</td>\n<td>7,966</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/61</td>\n<td>9,935</td>\n<td>4,680</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/62</td>\n<td>23,963</td>\n<td>14,142</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/63</td>\n<td>14,014</td>\n<td>10,478</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>TOTAL</td>\n<td>64,998</td>\n<td>37,266</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSalinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for *Catcher in\nthe Rye* and *Nine Stories* not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’\ntermination notice for *Catcher in the Rye* and indicated that the ML\nwould have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to\nSalinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important\nbooks in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified\na manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000\ncopies of *Catcher in the Rye* and over 37,000 copies of *Nine Stories*\nand asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another\nthree years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963).\n\nThere is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in\nJuly that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no\nmore printings of *Catcher in the Rye* (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July\n1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is\nincluded in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer\n1964 stock list.\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of *Catcher in\nthe Rye*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when *Four\nContemporary French Plays* (598) was published as ML 90.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSalinger*, Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516"

Cerf indicated that since the ML would be\nmaking new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that\nit would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to\nAldridge, 19 July 1957).\n\nWodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he\nwould be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in *Carry\nOn, Jeeves!* were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML\nused most of the first Jeeves book and all of *Very Good, Jeeves*. He\nalso suggested updating several references in the stories and changing\nthe title to *A Gathering of Jeeves* (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August\n1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked\nWodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that\nhe weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that\nfor Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also\nasked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories.\n“Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period\nand . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary\nconfusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent\nadmirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title *Selected\nStories*. “The latter \\[*A Gathering of Jeeves*\\] may sound a little bit\nbetter, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell\nbest when they state very clearly what the book contains, without\nreaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August\n1957).\n\nWodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s\nintroduction was written for the ML but also appeared in *New World\nWriting*, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92."

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1958 1958 In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A.\nKnopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the\nModern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason\nEpstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at\nDoubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books\npioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other\npublishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a\nbrilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the\npublishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who\nalso admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and\ndifficult to work with.\n\nPart of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an\nindependent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library,\nwhich Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make\nhis fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after\nseveral years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for\nModern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern\nLibrary itself.\n\nDespite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of\nthe series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another\nperson, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have\nsaved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have\naccelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital\nup-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been\nabandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or\nbecause to do the job right would have been too expensive for the\npotential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of\ncontemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s\nimage as a series of indisputably significant books.\n\nEpstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a\nchange from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the\nModern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had\nalways been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial\nsuccess had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series\nmight have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at\na minimum. Nine titles were added and six were discontinued. Swift’s *Gulliver’s\nTravels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (1931) was superseded\nby Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings.* This brought the\nlist of available titles to 312. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine. $1.65 Moses Hadas suggested a ML reprint of the edition of ten plays of\nEuripides that he and John Harvey McLean had translated (Dial Press,\n1936), but Penguin Books and New American Library had both recently\npublished inexpensive new translations and Jason Epstein thought the ML\nshould wait (Epstein to Hadas, 14 November 1958). In the end the ML\nreprinted the University of Chicago Press’s *Complete Greek Tragedie*s,\nedited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore (4 vols., 1959; ML reprint,\n7 volumes, 1960–63). Eric Bentley suggested a book of six Lope de Vega\nplays (Bentley to Epstein, 16 November 1958). Klopfer rejected a\nsuggestion to publish a new edition of *Democracy in America* as a ML\nGiant (Klopfer to Lerner, 13 November 1958).
