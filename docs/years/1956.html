<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1956</h1>
<h2>1956</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The discussions with Allen Lane that began in 1954 about the possibility
of Random House acquiring the American branch of Penguin Books resumed
in the summer of 1956. A Random House memorandum in July outlined a
possible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American
market. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in
America, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin
obligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library
Paperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August,
Cerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on
the situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own
paper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands”
(Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at
this point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer
wrote Lane:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just
a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we
were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I’ll be
delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as
an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to
Lane, 28 August 1958).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House
expanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with
Viking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin.</p>
<p>The Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original
publishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February
1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the
Modern Library’s contract for Conrad’s <em>Victory</em> and put it into an
Anchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because <em>Victory</em>
was only five years away from entering the public domain. But other
significant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking
Press withdrew James Joyce’s <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> in
1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Ten new titles were added to the series. Seven titles were discontinued.
Tchekov, <em>Plays</em> (1930) was superseded by Chekhov <em>Best Plays</em> and
Voltaire’s <em>Candide</em> (1918) was superseded by Voltaire’s <em>Candide and
Other Writings.</em> This brought the total in the title list to 305.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with
the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.
The binding cloth was red, blue, green, or gray with lettering on inset
panels in black on the front cover and spine.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>$1.45.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Tennyson, <em>Selected Poetry</em> xHuxley, <em>Brave New World</em>; Giants
through G79; jackets: 376. (Fall) Huxley, <em>Brave New World</em> xCaesar,
<em>Gallic War</em>; Giants through G80 with G45 Lewisohn, <em>Story of American
Literature</em>; jackets: 377.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf asked Richard Watts, Jr., to edit <em>New Voices in the European
Theatre</em> as a companion volume to the 1955 anthology, <em>New Voices in the
American Theatre</em> (Cerf to Watts, 11 October 1956). Watts was interested
but the book never appeared. John W. Aldridge suggested ten possible ML
titles, including a Wodehouse reader, Ford Madox Ford’s <em>The Good
Soldier</em>, Malcolm Lowry’s <em>Under the Volcano</em>, a volume of Nathanael
West’s novels, the basic writings of Alfred North Whitehead, a Sherlock
Holmes collection in the Giants, a Giant anthology of great short
novels, and an anthology of fiction by younger postwar writers (Aldridge
to Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Stein liked the Wodehouse and great short
novels ideas and noted that Macmillan had turned down earlier proposals
for a Whitehead collection (Stein memo to Haydn, undated). Cerf thought
the Wodehouse and Whitehead collections and the great short novels and
postwar fiction anthologies had possibilities (Cerf to Aldridge, 22
August 1956). Aldridge submitted a tentative table of contents for
<em>Great American Short Novels</em>, but the only ML title that resulted from
his proposals was Wodehouse’s <em>Selected Stories</em> (1958: 505).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Rejected and neglected when published in 1886, <em>The Bostonians</em> has
now taken its place as the culminating novel of James’s middle period.
The harshness of its reception was natural. It satirized the cranks
and charlatans of the post-Civil-War era; its hero was a Southerner;
and in its portrayal of the relations of its two leading female
characters it skirted a subject then taboo—the theme of sexual
abnormality. Today the story of the contest between Olive Chancellor,
the arch-feminist, and Basil Ransome, the Southern traditionalist, as
to which shall mold and dominate the beautiful, guileless Verena
Tarrant has come to be recognized as perhaps the most enjoyable of all
the James novels. (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few writers, if indeed any, surpass Voltaire in versatility and
enduring vitality. Novelist, poet, dramatist, literary critic,
philosopher, historian, scientist, political essayist: Voltaire was
all these—and always with brilliance of wit and lucidity of style.</p>
<p>The most representative figure of the Age of Enlightenment, he remains
after two centuries an abundant fountainhead of good sense and of
memorable enjoyment to every reader. This immortal talent is richly
represented in this volume, edited by Haskell M. Block of the
University of Wisconsin with a stimulating introduction on the
importance of Voltaire to our own times. (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding Voltaire, <em>Candide</em> (1918: 46).
Published May 1956. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1956. First printing: Probably 5,000
copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. Reissued 1985.</p>
<p>“I have attempted to provide an indication of Voltaire’s range and
complexity by selecting those works which have most clearly become of a
vital part of our intellectual and artistic heritage. . . . The text of
this edition has been prepared in the hope of making some improvement
over previous English versions. All of the selections are complete.
There are no excerpts of letters or parts of chapters. . . . It is hoped
that the translations in this collection will help to make a beginning
toward an accurate edition of Voltaire in English. In every section of
the volume I have provided new translations wherever they were
necessary. I should add that the translations from Voltaire’s
<em>Notebooks</em> are the first from that work to appear in an English
edition. . . . Where older translations have been used, they have been
thoroughly revised. In particular, for all of the fiction except
<em>Candide</em>, I have modernized the version of Robert Bruce Boswell. The
translation of <em>Candide</em> is by Richard Aldington. I am especially
grateful to Martyn P. Pollack for the selections from his excellent
version of <em>The Age of Louis XIV</em>, and to Floyd Gray for his assistance
in the translating of Voltaire’s correspondence.” (Editorial Note, pp.
xxi–xxii)</p>
<p>The chapters of <em>Candide</em>, like those in the 1930 ML edition (46.2), are
set as single paragraphs, following the 1928 Random House limited
edition of <em>Candide</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The highly unusual story of a young man booted from Paradise,
<em>Candide</em> is Voltaire’s most famous novel as well as a scorching
indictment of the philosophy of Liebnitz [<em>sic</em>], which was summed
up by Voltaire in the thought: “All is for the best in this best of
all possible worlds.” Candide’s tutor, the philosophic Dr. Pangloss,
is the embodiment of this unlikely theory, maintaining it in spite of
the most blatant evidence to the contrary. The young Candide is
expelled from the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh for making love to the
Baron’s daughter, Cunégonde; and thereafter he, Pangloss and Cunégonde
embark on what develops into a long series of adventures. Sometimes
together, usually apart, in various corners of the earth, they endure
a brutal succession of the most unfair and calamitous events
conceivable. Eventually they settle down together on a little farm.
Candide marries Cunégonde, now grown ugly as a radish, and tells
himself often, “We must cultivate our garden.”</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Few areas of world literature are as little known to English-speaking
readers as Spanish fiction. Yet none is more highly regarded by those
who have had the opportunity to explore it. The sixteen stories
selected for this volume by Angel Flores represent some of the best
prose fiction of modern times and include the work of such old masters
as Alarcón and Unamuno as well as the work of younger writers now
living in Spain or in exile. The editors of the Modern Library are
pleased to add this volume to the rich coverage of great literature
now in the series. (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few poets in the history of English literature were gifted with a
greater range of theme and style than Tennyson. He wrote in many
forms, in many moods—and in his poetry he tried to cope with a world
of shaken beliefs and uncertain values. “In the essential nature of
his idealism and his disillusioned melancholy, his pervading sense of
irreparable loss,” writes Professor Bush in the Introduction, “he is
very much our contemporary, the poet of an age of anxiety.” (<em>Spring
1956</em>)</p>

on and replied that could not meet the September deadline (Bush to
Stein, 30 June 1950). Stein was flexible, and Bush accepted on the
condition that he would submit the manuscript as soon as he could (Bush
to Stein, 16 July 1950). The ML paid him an additional $50 for a student
assistant. The manuscript was delivered in mid-October 1950. Bush
received an additional $100 when <em>Selected Poetry of Tennyson</em> was added

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Bernard Shaw has been called “the liveliest and, in many ways, the
youngest intellect of the century.” This estimate is fully supported
by the three “problem” plays in this volume:</p>
<p>SAINT JOAN, a searching portrayal of Joan of Arc—one of Shaw’s
greatest successes in the theatre,</p>
<p>MAJOR BARBARA, a devastating indictment of insincere
philanthropy—regarded by some critics as one of Shaw’s finest works,</p>
<p>ANDROCLES AND THE LION, a brilliant exploration of the varieties of
faith—a perennial favorite of Shaw admirers.</p>
<p>Often disconcerting and irreverent, Shaw never fails to be
thought-provoking in his charmingly witty way. The Modern Library
takes pride in adding these plays to those already available in <em>Four
Plays by Bernard Shaw</em> (ML 10). (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
George Bernard Shaw has been hailed as the greatest British dramatist
since Shakespeare, and this volume contains three of his most highly
regarded—and most frequently revived—plays.</p>
<p><em>Saint Joan</em>, Shaw’s ironic study of Joan of Arc as a woman who had to
be killed because the world was not yet ready for a saint, is
considered by many to be his best play and has a title role that
continues to challenge leading actresses.</p>
<p><em>Major Barbara</em>, the story of the daughter of a wealthy munitions
manufacturer who joins the Salvation Army to defy her father, preaches
the still timely lesson that poverty is the root of all evil.</p>
<p><em>Androcles and the Lion</em> is an unexpectedly hilarious, if biting,
satire on the early Christians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
<em>Brave New World</em> is a brilliantly satiric novel about life six
centuries from now (in “632 After Ford”), the Utopian era in which
science has, with juggernaut indifference, triumphed. It is an era of
perfect stability, control, conformity. There are, for example, no
mothers or fathers because babies are mass-produced from chemical
solutions in laboratory bottles; children are completely conditioned
for their designated roles as adults in a precisely ordered society.
Into this incredible world comes Bernard Marx, hatched in an
excessively alcoholic prenatal solution, with ideas worthy of the
primitive twentieth century.</p>
<p>This is a shocking, fantastic novel, rich in witty entertainment and
biting comment. Its status as a classic increases steadily as what
seemed imaginary fiction becomes each day more of a reality. (<em>Fall
1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1932; rights transferred
to Harper &amp; Bros., 1938; published with Huxley’s foreword by Harper &amp;
Bros., 1946. ML edition (pp. [<em>5</em>–<em>20</em>], 1–[311]) printed from
Doubleday/Harper plates with fly title reset and page numerals removed
from foreword and last page of text. Published October 1956. <em>WR</em> 15
October 1956. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January1968.</p>
<p>The ML expressed interest in <em>Brave New World</em> several times between
1942 and 1952, but the trade edition was selling too well for Harper’s
to consider a reprint. Sales had been small when Harper’s took over
<em>Brave New World</em> from Doubleday but then increased steadily. Sales
tripled in 1939; <em>Brave New World</em> sold 100 more copies in 1941 than it
had in 1939, giving Harper’s a gross profit that year of $300; sales
through July 1942 were up 10 percent from the previous year (Henry
Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros., to Cerf, 28 August 1942). Sales remained strong
when it was reissued in September 1946 with Huxley’s foreword, with
7,500 copies in print by December (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper &amp; Bros.,
to Klopfer, 3 December 1946). In 1951 Harper’s sold nearly 2,000 copies
in the $3.00 trade edition and 7,500 copies in a 95-cent College Edition
(Rose to Cerf, 27 May 1952).</p>
<p>Harper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement
for Cerf to edit <em>Reading for Pleasure</em>, an anthology published by
Harper &amp; Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to
do this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a
piece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to
do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern
Library. Both of these books I have been pleading for in vain for years,
so when the offer came, I melted” (Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
With this volume one of the great masters of world literature is
published for the first time in the Modern Library. Long described as
the Jewish Mark Twain, Sholom Aleichem (as Alfred Kazin says in his
introduction to this book) “perhaps more than any other Jewish writer
who has ever lived, writes about Jewishness as if it were a gift, a
marvel, an unending theme of wonder and delight.” The vitality, the
laughter, the compassion in these stories are matchless. Peopled as
they are with such extraordinary characters as the lovable Tevye, the
dairyman, Menachem-Mendel, professional matchmaker, and a host of
others, they go beyond their faithful portrayal of the life of the
Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern Europe to represent, in a way
unequaled by any other writer, the Jewish soul. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“As time passes,” writes John Gassner, “one name among the post-Ibsen
dramatists leads all the rest.” That one is Anton Chekhov, whose major
plays are presented here in the remarkably sensitive and skillful
translations of Stark Young.</p>
<p>For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp and
poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding, these
plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Chekhov world
famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal
experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not
only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most
revered. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding <em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em>,
translated by Constance Garnett (193). Published October 1956. <em>WR</em> 5
November 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1986.</p>
<p>Young received a $900 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on all
copies sold in the U.S. and 5 percent of the net sums received from all
copies sold at export. He received an additional $100 for writing the
introduction. A year before Chekhov’s <em>Best Plays</em> was published Stein
had reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern
Library were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer
regarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the
excellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,
<em>The Cherry Orchard</em>, <em>The Three Sisters</em>, <em>Uncle Vanya</em>, and <em>The Sea
Gull</em>. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to
Lois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights;
there seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this
stage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange
for the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of
course go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo
to Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”</p>
<p>With the Young translation of Chekhov, <em>Best Plays</em> the ML reverted to
the spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring
1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript
of her preface to <em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em> (1930: 193) was probably
responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le
Gallienne file).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Chekhov’s reputation as a founder of modern drama rests on the four
plays in this volume. So revolutionary were these plays in their
simplicity and naturalness of form, subject, and dialogue, that to
produce them required a new school of acting, and a new Russian
theater. Immediately popular in Russia, Chekhov’s plays soon were
produced all over Europe. So purely original that they could not be
imitated, these plays, with Ibsen’s, laid to rest the outmoded forms
of European theater, opening it to innovation in all areas. Today they
are as popular as ever.</p>

<em>The Greek Commonwealth</em> is a vivid account of Athens during its

art and architecture reached unsurpassed heights: the time of the
Parthenon and Acropolis.</p>
<p>In few periods of human history have so much achievement, so much
creative genius, so much epochal decision been concentrated as in
fifth-century Athens. No understanding of the Western heritage is

mankind. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>

<p>The ML paid Oxford University Press royalties of 7½ cents a copy on all
copies sold in the U.S. and 7½ percent of the net sums received on all
copies sold at export. Stein told Cerf that <em>The Greek Commonwealth</em> was
“one of the classic works on Greek history. This is an account of Athens
during the fifth century when art, poetry and drama reached their
highest state. Although it is primarily a political and economic
account, it seems to me to be one of the clearest pictures of Greece in
its finest day” (Stein memo to Cerf, 10 June 1955). Stein also talked to
Klopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford
University Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered
that we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’s <em>The Greek
Commonwealth</em> and we should like very much to include it in the Modern
Library” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955).</p>
<p>An internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with
Oxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transfer <em>The
Greek Commonwealth</em> to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A
decision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in
as small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don
Singer, 19 November 1968).</p>

These are the stories that John O’Hara likes best. Each of them
reflects his unique insight into the complex, aimless, frustrated
lives of his characters—the smart, the savage, the disillusioned, the
bitter, the ordinary. Varied in mood, time and place, these stories
show with an over-riding compassion the pathos and humor of men and

First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990.</p>
<p>O’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he
liked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: <em>The
Doctor’s Son and Other Stories</em> (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), <em>Files on
Parade</em> (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), <em>Pipe Night</em> (Duell, Sloan and Pearce,
1945) and <em>Hellbox</em> (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything
from <em>Pal Joey</em> (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out
with Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on
O’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the
32 stories in the ML collection were from <em>Pipe Night</em> and <em>Hellbox</em>.
O’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which
concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of them [the stories] were written in the twenty years from
1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for
<em>The New Yorker</em> than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my
characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously
hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to
call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing
to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick
of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in
Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well,
damn their eyes.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years
I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the
preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But
during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was
part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and
one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection,
Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, <em>O’Hara Concern</em>, p.
233).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended
deleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it
(Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955).
Cerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to
persuade him to tone down his language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your
Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself
as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but
important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time,
I promise never to mention the matter again.</p>
<p>I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out
of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence,
“The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even
last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE
TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not
think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected
Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment.
This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a
collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short
stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant
reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly
concerned even remembers?</p>
<p>I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in
or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just
hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and,
furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New
Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. [Harold] Ross, who was Editor of
the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead;
[Brendan] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand
times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the
good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are
slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.</p>
<p>I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands,
several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of
your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.</p>
<p>There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and
that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably
telephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf
immediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an
introduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).</p>
<p>There were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, <em>John

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1956\n\n## 1956\n\n### General\n\nThe discussions with Allen Lane that began in 1954 about the possibility\nof Random House acquiring the American branch of Penguin Books resumed\nin the summer of 1956. A Random House memorandum in July outlined a\npossible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American\nmarket. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in\nAmerica, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin\nobligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library\nPaperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August,\nCerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on\nthe situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own\npaper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands”\n(Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at\nthis point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer\nwrote Lane:\n\n> Almost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just\n> a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we\n> were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I’ll be\n> delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as\n> an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to\n> Lane, 28 August 1958).\n\nBut the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House\nexpanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with\nViking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin.\n\nThe Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original\npublishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February\n1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the\nModern Library’s contract for Conrad’s *Victory* and put it into an\nAnchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because *Victory*\nwas only five years away from entering the public domain. But other\nsignificant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking\nPress withdrew James Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in\n1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nTen new titles were added to the series. Seven titles were discontinued.\nTchekov, *Plays* (1930) was superseded by Chekhov *Best Plays* and\nVoltaire’s *Candide* (1918) was superseded by Voltaire’s *Candide and\nOther Writings.* This brought the total in the title list to 305.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green, or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine.\n\n### Price\n\n$1.45.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Tennyson, *Selected Poetry* xHuxley, *Brave New World*; Giants\nthrough G79; jackets: 376. (Fall) Huxley, *Brave New World* xCaesar,\n*Gallic War*; Giants through G80 with G45 Lewisohn, *Story of American\nLiterature*; jackets: 377.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf asked Richard Watts, Jr., to edit *New Voices in the European\nTheatre* as a companion volume to the 1955 anthology, *New Voices in the\nAmerican Theatre* (Cerf to Watts, 11 October 1956). Watts was interested\nbut the book never appeared. John W. Aldridge suggested ten possible ML\ntitles, including a Wodehouse reader, Ford Madox Ford’s *The Good\nSoldier*, Malcolm Lowry’s *Under the Volcano*, a volume of Nathanael\nWest’s novels, the basic writings of Alfred North Whitehead, a Sherlock\nHolmes collection in the Giants, a Giant anthology of great short\nnovels, and an anthology of fiction by younger postwar writers (Aldridge\nto Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Stein liked the Wodehouse and great short\nnovels ideas and noted that Macmillan had turned down earlier proposals\nfor a Whitehead collection (Stein memo to Haydn, undated). Cerf thought\nthe Wodehouse and Whitehead collections and the great short novels and\npostwar fiction anthologies had possibilities (Cerf to Aldridge, 22\nAugust 1956). Aldridge submitted a tentative table of contents for\n*Great American Short Novels*, but the only ML title that resulted from\nhis proposals was Wodehouse’s *Selected Stories* (1958: 505).\n\n### New titles\n\nJames, *The Bostonians* (1956) 480\n\nVoltaire, *Candide and Other Writings* (1956) 481\n\nFlores, ed., *Great Spanish Stories* (1956) 482\n\nTennyson, *Selected Poetry* (1956) 483\n\nShaw, *Saint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956) 484\n\nHuxley, *Brave New World* (1956) 485\n\nAleichem, *Selected Stories* (1956) 486\n\nChekhov, *Best Plays* (1956) 487\n\nZimmern, *Greek Commonwealth* (1956) 488\n\nO’Hara, *Selected Short Stories* (1956) 489### Discontinued\n\nDay, *Life with Father* (1944)\n\nDu Maurier, *Peter Ibbetson* (1932)\n\nHersey, *Bell for Adano* (1946)\n\nJoyce, *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (1928)\n\nKronenberger, ed., *Anthology of Light Verse* (1935)\n\nLardner, *Collected Short Stories* (1941)\n\nMansfield, *Garden Party* (1931)\n\nTchekov, *Plays* (1930)\\*\n\nVoltaire, *Candide* (1918) 46\\*\\*\n\n\\*Superseded by Chekhov, *Best Plays* (1956: 487)\n\n\\*\\*Superseded by Voltaire, *Candide and Other Writings* (1956: 481)\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 480\n\n**HENRY JAMES.

Stein offered Bush a flat fee of $250 to write the introduction and\nselect the contents, with the manuscript due by 30 September (Stein to\nBush, 28 June 1950). Bush was behind schedule on a book he was working\non and replied that could not meet the September deadline (Bush to\nStein, 30 June 1950). Stein was flexible, and Bush accepted on the\ncondition that he would submit the manuscript as soon as he could (Bush\nto Stein, 16 July 1950). The ML paid him an additional $50 for a student\nassistant. The manuscript was delivered in mid-October 1950. Bush\nreceived an additional $100 when *Selected Poetry of Tennyson* was added\nto the regular ML (Stein to Bush, 1 March 1956).\n\nThe text was set from the Cambridge Edition, *The Complete Poetical\nWorks of Tennyson,* edited by W. J.

Discontinued 1 January1968.\n\nThe ML expressed interest in *Brave New World* several times between\n1942 and 1952, but the trade edition was selling too well for Harper’s\nto consider a reprint. Sales had been small when Harper’s took over\n*Brave New World* from Doubleday but then increased steadily. Sales\ntripled in 1939; *Brave New World* sold 100 more copies in 1941 than it\nhad in 1939, giving Harper’s a gross profit that year of $300; sales\nthrough July 1942 were up 10 percent from the previous year (Henry\nHoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 28 August 1942). Sales remained strong\nwhen it was reissued in September 1946 with Huxley’s foreword, with\n7,500 copies in print by December (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper & Bros.,\nto Klopfer, 3 December 1946). In 1951 Harper’s sold nearly 2,000 copies\nin the $3.00 trade edition and 7,500 copies in a 95-cent College Edition\n(Rose to Cerf, 27 May 1952).\n\nHarper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement\nfor Cerf to edit *Reading for Pleasure*, an anthology published by\nHarper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to\ndo this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a\npiece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to\ndo Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern\nLibrary.

He received an additional $100 for writing the\nintroduction. A year before Chekhov’s *Best Plays* was published Stein\nhad reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern\nLibrary were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer\nregarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the\nexcellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,\n*The Cherry Orchard*, *The Three Sisters*, *Uncle Vanya*, and *The Sea\nGull*. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to\nLois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights;\nthere seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this\nstage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange\nfor the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of\ncourse go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo\nto Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”\n\nWith the Young translation of Chekhov, *Best Plays* the ML reverted to\nthe spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring\n1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript\nof her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably\nresponsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le\nGallienne file).\n\n#### 487b.

Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956.\nFirst printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990.\n\nO’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he\nliked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: *The\nDoctor’s Son and Other Stories* (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), *Files on\nParade* (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), *Pipe Night* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce,\n1945) and *Hellbox* (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything\nfrom *Pal Joey* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out\nwith Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on\nO’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the\n32 stories in the ML collection were from *Pipe Night* and *Hellbox*.\nO’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which\nconcluded:\n\n> Most of them \\[the stories\\] were written in the twenty years from\n> 1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for\n> *The New Yorker* than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my\n> characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously\n> hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to\n> call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing\n> to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick\n> of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in\n> Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well,\n> damn their eyes.\n>\n> I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years\n> I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the\n> preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But\n> during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was\n> part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and\n> one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection,\n> Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, *O’Hara Concern*, p.\n> 233).\n\nThe foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended\ndeleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it\n(Weil, Gotshal & Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955).\nCerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to\npersuade him to tone down his language:\n\n> Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your\n> Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself\n> as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but\n> important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time,\n> I promise never to mention the matter again.\n>\n> I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out\n> of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence,\n> “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even\n> last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE\n> TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not\n> think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected\n> Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment.\n> This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a\n> collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short\n> stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant\n> reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly\n> concerned even remembers?\n>\n> I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in\n> or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just\n> hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and,\n> furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New\n> Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. \\[Harold\\] Ross, who was Editor of\n> the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead;\n> \\[Brendan\\] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand\n> times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the\n> good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are\n> slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.\n>\n> I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands,\n> several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of\n> your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.\n>\n> There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and\n> that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).\n\nThere is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably\ntelephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf\nimmediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an\nintroduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).\n\nThere were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, *John\nO’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography*, p. 216).\n\n#### 489b.

A Random House memorandum in July outlined a\npossible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American\nmarket. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in\nAmerica, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin\nobligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library\nPaperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August,\nCerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on\nthe situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own\npaper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands”\n(Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at\nthis point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer\nwrote Lane:\n\n> Almost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just\n> a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we\n> were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I’ll be\n> delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as\n> an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to\n> Lane, 28 August 1958).\n\nBut the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House\nexpanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with\nViking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin.\n\nThe Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original\npublishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February\n1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the\nModern Library’s contract for Conrad’s *Victory* and put it into an\nAnchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because *Victory*\nwas only five years away from entering the public domain. But other\nsignificant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking\nPress withdrew James Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in\n1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn.",
  "numberOfTitles": "Ten new titles were added to the series. Seven titles were discontinued.\nTchekov, *Plays* (1930) was superseded by Chekhov *Best Plays* and\nVoltaire’s *Candide* (1918) was superseded by Voltaire’s *Candide and\nOther Writings.* This brought the total in the title list to 305.",

Watts was interested\nbut the book never appeared. John W. Aldridge suggested ten possible ML\ntitles, including a Wodehouse reader, Ford Madox Ford’s *The Good\nSoldier*, Malcolm Lowry’s *Under the Volcano*, a volume of Nathanael\nWest’s novels, the basic writings of Alfred North Whitehead, a Sherlock\nHolmes collection in the Giants, a Giant anthology of great short\nnovels, and an anthology of fiction by younger postwar writers (Aldridge\nto Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Stein liked the Wodehouse and great short\nnovels ideas and noted that Macmillan had turned down earlier proposals\nfor a Whitehead collection (Stein memo to Haydn, undated). Cerf thought\nthe Wodehouse and Whitehead collections and the great short novels and\npostwar fiction anthologies had possibilities (Cerf to Aldridge, 22\nAugust 1956).

A year before Chekhov’s *Best Plays* was published Stein\nhad reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern\nLibrary were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer\nregarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the\nexcellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,\n*The Cherry Orchard*, *The Three Sisters*, *Uncle Vanya*, and *The Sea\nGull*. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to\nLois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights;\nthere seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this\nstage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange\nfor the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of\ncourse go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo\nto Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”\n\nWith the Young translation of Chekhov, *Best Plays* the ML reverted to\nthe spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring\n1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript\nof her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably\nresponsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le\nGallienne file).\n\n#### 487b.

It was the time, too, in which\n> art and architecture reached unsurpassed heights: the time of the\n> Parthenon and Acropolis.\n>\n> In few periods of human history have so much achievement, so much\n> creative genius, so much epochal decision been concentrated as in\n> fifth-century Athens. No understanding of the Western heritage is\n> complete without knowledge of this stirring hour in the history of\n> mankind. (*Fall 1956*)\n\nOriginally published in England by Clarendon Press, 1911; 5th ed.\npublished by Oxford University Press, 1931. ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Published October 1956. *WR* 5\nNovember 1956. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe ML paid Oxford University Press royalties of 7½ cents a copy on all\ncopies sold in the U.S. and 7½ percent of the net sums received on all\ncopies sold at export. Stein told Cerf that *The Greek Commonwealth* was\n“one of the classic works on Greek history. This is an account of Athens\nduring the fifth century when art, poetry and drama reached their\nhighest state. Although it is primarily a political and economic\naccount, it seems to me to be one of the clearest pictures of Greece in\nits finest day” (Stein memo to Cerf, 10 June 1955). Stein also talked to\nKlopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford\nUniversity Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered\nthat we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’s *The Greek\nCommonwealth* and we should like very much to include it in the Modern\nLibrary” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955).\n\nAn internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with\nOxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transfer *The\nGreek Commonwealth* to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A\ndecision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in\nas small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don\nSinger, 19 November 1968)."

Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956.\nFirst printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990.\n\nO’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he\nliked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: *The\nDoctor’s Son and Other Stories* (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), *Files on\nParade* (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), *Pipe Night* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce,\n1945) and *Hellbox* (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything\nfrom *Pal Joey* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out\nwith Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on\nO’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the\n32 stories in the ML collection were from *Pipe Night* and *Hellbox*.\nO’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which\nconcluded:\n\n> Most of them \\[the stories\\] were written in the twenty years from\n> 1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for\n> *The New Yorker* than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my\n> characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously\n> hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to\n> call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing\n> to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick\n> of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in\n> Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well,\n> damn their eyes.\n>\n> I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years\n> I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the\n> preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But\n> during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was\n> part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and\n> one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection,\n> Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, *O’Hara Concern*, p.\n> 233).\n\nThe foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended\ndeleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it\n(Weil, Gotshal & Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955).\nCerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to\npersuade him to tone down his language:\n\n> Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your\n> Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself\n> as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but\n> important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time,\n> I promise never to mention the matter again.\n>\n> I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out\n> of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence,\n> “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even\n> last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE\n> TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not\n> think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected\n> Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment.\n> This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a\n> collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short\n> stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant\n> reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly\n> concerned even remembers?\n>\n> I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in\n> or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just\n> hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and,\n> furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New\n> Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. \\[Harold\\] Ross, who was Editor of\n> the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead;\n> \\[Brendan\\] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand\n> times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the\n> good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are\n> slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.\n>\n> I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands,\n> several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of\n> your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.\n>\n> There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and\n> that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).\n\nThere is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably\ntelephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf\nimmediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an\nintroduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).\n\nThere were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, *John\nO’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography*, p. 216).\n\n#### 489b.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1956 1956 The discussions with Allen Lane that began in 1954 about the possibility\nof Random House acquiring the American branch of Penguin Books resumed\nin the summer of 1956. A Random House memorandum in July outlined a\npossible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American\nmarket. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in\nAmerica, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin\nobligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library\nPaperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August,\nCerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on\nthe situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own\npaper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands”\n(Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at\nthis point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer\nwrote Lane:\n\n> Almost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just\n> a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we\n> were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I’ll be\n> delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as\n> an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to\n> Lane, 28 August 1958).\n\nBut the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House\nexpanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with\nViking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin.\n\nThe Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original\npublishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February\n1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the\nModern Library’s contract for Conrad’s *Victory* and put it into an\nAnchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because *Victory*\nwas only five years away from entering the public domain. But other\nsignificant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking\nPress withdrew James Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in\n1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn. Ten new titles were added to the series. Seven titles were discontinued.\nTchekov, *Plays* (1930) was superseded by Chekhov *Best Plays* and\nVoltaire’s *Candide* (1918) was superseded by Voltaire’s *Candide and\nOther Writings.* This brought the total in the title list to 305. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green, or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine. $1.45. (Spring) Tennyson, *Selected Poetry* xHuxley, *Brave New World*; Giants\nthrough G79; jackets: 376. (Fall) Huxley, *Brave New World* xCaesar,\n*Gallic War*; Giants through G80 with G45 Lewisohn, *Story of American\nLiterature*; jackets: 377. Cerf asked Richard Watts, Jr., to edit *New Voices in the European\nTheatre* as a companion volume to the 1955 anthology, *New Voices in the\nAmerican Theatre* (Cerf to Watts, 11 October 1956). Watts was interested\nbut the book never appeared. John W. Aldridge suggested ten possible ML\ntitles, including a Wodehouse reader, Ford Madox Ford’s *The Good\nSoldier*, Malcolm Lowry’s *Under the Volcano*, a volume of Nathanael\nWest’s novels, the basic writings of Alfred North Whitehead, a Sherlock\nHolmes collection in the Giants, a Giant anthology of great short\nnovels, and an anthology of fiction by younger postwar writers (Aldridge\nto Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Stein liked the Wodehouse and great short\nnovels ideas and noted that Macmillan had turned down earlier proposals\nfor a Whitehead collection (Stein memo to Haydn, undated). Cerf thought\nthe Wodehouse and Whitehead collections and the great short novels and\npostwar fiction anthologies had possibilities (Cerf to Aldridge, 22\nAugust 1956). Aldridge submitted a tentative table of contents for\n*Great American Short Novels*, but the only ML title that resulted from\nhis proposals was Wodehouse’s *Selected Stories* (1958: 505). James, *The Bostonians* (1956) 480\n\nVoltaire, *Candide and Other Writings* (1956) 481\n\nFlores, ed., *Great Spanish Stories* (1956) 482\n\nTennyson, *Selected Poetry* (1956) 483\n\nShaw, *Saint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956) 484\n\nHuxley, *Brave New World* (1956) 485\n\nAleichem, *Selected Stories* (1956) 486\n\nChekhov, *Best Plays* (1956) 487\n\nZimmern, *Greek Commonwealth* (1956) 488\n\nO’Hara, *Selected Short Stories* (1956) 489 The discussions with Allen Lane that began in 1954 about the possibility\nof Random House acquiring the American branch of Penguin Books resumed\nin the summer of 1956.
