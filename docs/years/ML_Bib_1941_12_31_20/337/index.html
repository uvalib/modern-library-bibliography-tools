Adult readers of every taste and opinion turn back to these monumental novels of the Romantic School for escape [+and excitement] and solace, and new generations receive their first introduction to the world of good books by the discovery of such [+pulse-quickening] novels asThe Hunchback of Notre Dame. Young and old are rewarded by a story that stirs the heart and kindles the imagination. (Spring 1941; [Fall 1953])"

      "#text": "The anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on the first printing of Hugo’sNotre-Dame de Paris(1831) and does not include three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in December 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and Book Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation used by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and Book Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and 5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not “augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The three added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been misplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be included in the 1832 printing (Hugo,Notre-Dame de Paris, translated and edited by John Sturrock [London: Penguin Books, 2004], pp. 26–29)."

    {
      "#text": "The absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill That), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the printing press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the public expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during the world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan pagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of the human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious symbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own monument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191)."

It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. Hugo’sLes Misérables(G3) was in first quarter of ML titles at both periods."
