    "Jacket:Non-pictorial on cream paper printed in grayish yellow green (105) with title in ornamental lettering in deep orange (51), very dark green (147), and moderate greenish blue (173); subtitle and author in script lettering in very dark green and moderate greenish blue. Adapted from Ernst Reichl’s jacket for the original RH edition. The original jacket is signed “REICHL” in sans-serif capitals along the lower right margin. The reduction in size of the ML jacket is achieved by cropping the side and lower margins, resulting in the omission of his name.",
    "Front flap:",
    "When this volume first appeared in 1934 under the Random House imprint, William Saroyan’s meteoric flight across the literary skies was begun. For a book of short stories, it had an unprecedented success and was an augury of his continuing national fame. Since then William Saroyan has maintained his position among the foremost writers of America. Winner of the Drama Critics Circle award and also winner, but scorner, of the Pulitzer Prize forThe Time of Your Life, he has achieved quite as sensational a name for himself in the field of the drama as in the short story. (Spring 1941)",
    "Originally published by Random House, 1934. ML edition (pp. [vii–x], 9–270) printed from RH plates with running heads removed to accommodate the ML’s smaller format and with page numerals 7–8 removed from the table of contents, which was revised to include Saroyan’s preface to the ML edition. Published January 1941.WR25 January 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948.",
    "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapezewas one of the first trade titles published by Random House. Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to design trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the plates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such as the removal of running heads.",
    "The ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML titles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the ML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was out of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print and that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to Saroyan, 5 April 1949)."
