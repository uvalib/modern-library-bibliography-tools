Front flap: No nation has made a richer contribution to the recent literature of the theatre than Ireland. Her playwrights have brought about a renaissance of the drama in their own country and have earned the world’s admiration. The plays in this volume represent the finest flowering of the Irish genius in the drama, and include the complete texts ofThe Playboy of the Western WorldandRiders to the Seaby J. M. Synge,Juno and the Paycockby Sean O’Casey,Spreading the Newsby Lady Gregory andShadow and Substanceby Paul Vincent Carroll. George Jean Nathan provides a scintillating introduction. (Spring 1941) Original ML anthology. Published March 1941.WR15 March 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. The working title of the anthology when it was being planned wasSix Great Modern Irish Plays. Cerf wanted to include William Butler Yeats’s one-act play,Cathleen ni Houlihan. He initially offered a flat fee of $50 to include the play, then increased the offer to a $100 advance against royalties of 1 percent of the list price. Mrs. Yeats did not reply to his letters. The Synge estate granted permission to includeThe Playboy of the Western WorldandRiders to the Seafor a $200 advance against a 2 percent royalty. The Synge estate received the entire amount even though Random House, as Synge’s U.S. publisher, might have claimed half of it; the advance exceeded the total 1939 royalties for the RH edition of Synge’sComplete Works(Cerf to Denis Synge Stephens, 15 October 1940). Lady Gregory’sSpreading the Newswas obtained for a flat fee of $25. The ML edition sold 3,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the fourth quarter of ML titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952."
