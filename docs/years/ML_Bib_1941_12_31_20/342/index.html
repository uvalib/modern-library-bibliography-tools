Now, just as it had four centuries before the Christian era, Plato’s description of the ideal commonwealth has a special timeliness; it outlines a pattern of government that free men can follow with trust and conviction. This edition includes, in addition to the complete and unabridged text, the Jowett references and marginal notes. (Fall 1957)"

The most important of the Socratic dialogues, theRepublicis concerned with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But above all, theRepublicis an attempt to define “justice”; by imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers."
