    "For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have planned to include in the series the entire text of Plato’sThe Republicin the definitive Jowett version. That plan is now achieved in the fullest measure in this volume, which not only provides the complete and unabridged translation of the most famous of the Socratic dialogues, but also gives all of Jowett’s marginalia and references. Here, for student and general reader alike, is Plato’s forever timely description of the ideal commonwealth. (Fall 1941)",

    "The entire text of Plato’sThe Republicin the Benjamin Jowett translation is made available in the Modern Library series. At a time when interest in government, local and national, is of critical importance, the most famous of the Socratic dialogues offers guidance in the principles under which man can live in amity with his fellow-man. Now, just as it had four centuries before the Christian era, Plato’s description of the ideal commonwealth has a special timeliness; it outlines a pattern of government that free men can follow with trust and conviction. This edition includes, in addition to the complete and unabridged text, the Jowett references and marginal notes. (Fall 1957)",

    "No philosopher has had as profound an influence on the history of Western thought as Plato, and perhaps no one work has shaped our conception of the ideal society as much as Plato’sRepublic. The most important of the Socratic dialogues, theRepublicis concerned with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But above all, theRepublicis an attempt to define “justice”; by imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.",
