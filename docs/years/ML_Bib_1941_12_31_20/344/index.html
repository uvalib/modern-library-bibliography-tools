    "In his lifetime Ring Lardner was briefly described as a writer of humorous dialect, a baseball satirist and generally a funny fellow. This injustice to his reputation has been completely revised since his death by a new estimate of his place among the world’s great story–tellers. Now he is as much admired for his vigor and warmth and unfailing sense of the dramatic as for his irrepressible humor.The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner—thirty-five in all—represent, in John Chamberlain’s opinion, “The full measure of the talent of the man who is pre-eminently our best short story writer.” (Fall 1941)",
    "Jacket B:As jacket A except in black, vivid orange (48), light yellow (86) and gold with inset panel in black instead of vivid orange. (Fall 1944)",
    "Originally published asRound Up: The Stories of Ring W. Lardnerby Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. vii–467) printed from Scribner plates with fly title omitted. Published November 1941.WR8 November 1941. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.",
    "The ML paid Scribner’s a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had tried to get Lardner’s stories for the ML on several occasions before Scribner’s agreed to a reprint edition. He noted in spring 1941 when he requested permission to include the book in the fall, “It is a glaring omission on our list and it has been commented on so many times that I am getting tired of hearing it” (Cerf to Max Perkins, 1 May 1941). There was a second printing of 4,000 copies in March 1942 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in January 1943.",
    "The ML edition sold 7,800 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it in the first quarter of regular ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952."
