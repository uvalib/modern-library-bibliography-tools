(Spring 1941) Jacket A:Pictorial in dark red (16) and black on light grayish yellowish brown paper (79) with illustration in dark red of an American eagle with arrows and olive branch perched on a shield; lettering in black. Text on front: THE |Federalist| THE EIGHTY-FIVE ESSAYS WRITTEN BY |Alexander Hamilton·John Jay·James Madison| WHICH PERSUADED THE FOUNDING | FATHERS TO ADOPT THE CONSTITUTION | OF THE UNITED STATES. Front flap: For every American who is eager to know the fundamental principles upon which the Government of the United States was established, the first source isThe Federalist. These essays by Hamilton, Jay and Madison provided the arguments which persuaded the Founding Fathers to adopt the Constitution. They are required reading for an understanding of the ideal of representative government, now facing its most critical challenge in the one hundred and fifty years of America’s independence. By givingThe Federalistthe widest possible distribution at a cost within everybody’s purse, the Modern Library helps to explain the origins of our government to our people. (Spring 1941) Sesquicentennial Edition published by National Home Library Foundation, 1938. ML edition (pp. v–618) printed from National Home Library Foundation plates. Published January 1941.WR25 January 1941. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. The ML presented the National Home Library Foundation with a complete set of ML books in print in exchange for the free use of its plates. The first printing of the ML edition failed to acknowledge the Foundation. It included instead the following statement, adapted from the National Home Library Foundation edition: “Acknowledgment is made, with thanks, for the aid received from theCarnegie Corporation of New Yorkin making possible this edition ofThe Federalist” (p. [iv]). The ML removed the title leaf of remaining copies of the first printing and tipped in a new title leaf which acknowledged the National Home Library Foundation on the verso (338a2). The ML edition sold 7,782 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML titles. It sold 4,330 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, retaining its place in the first quarter of ML titles. 338a2.  First printing, second state (1941) Title as 338a1. Pagination as 338a1.[1]16(±2) [2–20]16[21–22]8 Contents as 338a1except pp. [iii–iv] removed and replaced by a newly printed sheet with the verso of the title page revised as follows: [iv] FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION | 1941 | The publishers are indebted to the National Home | Library Foundation for making this edition possible | and wish to thank them for the courtesy extended in | the use of their plates. | [4-line dedication]Note:The second leaf (pp. [iii–iv]) with the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation of New York (338a1) was removed from all copies in stock and replaced with a newly printed leaf with the acknowledgement to the National Home Library Foundation. Jacket A:As 338a1.Note:Some later printings on light bluish gray (191) paper. (Fall 1946) Sherman F. Mittell of the National Home Library Foundation informed Klopfer shortly after publication that the ML should have thanked the Foundation and that the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation would have to be removed. Klopfer agreed to rip the title leaf out of every copy in stock and tip in a corrected leaf with the acknowledgment, “The publishers are indebted to the National Home Library Foundation for making this edition possible and wish to thank them for the courtesy extended in the use of their plates” (Klopfer to Mittell, 27 February 1941; Mittell to Klopfer, 4 March 1941). A sizable portion of the first printing appears to have been distributed before the cancellation and replacement of the title leaf. Copies of 338a2are notably harder to find than copies of 338a1. After Mittell’s death in 1942 his widow offered to sell the National Home Library Foundation plates to the ML. Cerf offered $250, then raised his offer to $350 (Cerf to Fanny Mittell, 10 August 1942). The offer appears to have been accepted. In 1960 Jason Epstein reported that the ML paid no royalty and owned the plates free and clear but still showed practically no profit per copy (Epstein to Willard A. Lockwood, 24 May 1960). 338b.  Declaration of Independence added(1947) Title as 338a. Pp. [i–iv] v–xlv [xlvi], [1–2] 3–575 [576], [2], 577–622 [623–624].

This edition is printed by the Modern Library for the National Foundation for Education in American Citizenship, a nonprofit, nonpolitical educational organization. The printing for the National Foundation for Education in American Citizenship was undertaken as a commission and was not a ML publication. The publication statement on the verso of the title page identifying Random House as the publisher of the Modern Library is omitted, as is the manufacturing statement. The only references to the Modern Library appear on the spine of the binding and the backstrip of the jacket. The ML’s regular binding and endpapers are used."
