    "Ludwig Bemelmans | My War with the United States | Illustrated by the Author | The Modern Library | New York | [drawing of fort and cannon with turret of fort extending upward to the left of place of publication]",
    "Pp. [2], [1–8] 9–151 [152–158].  [1–10]8",
    "[1–2] blank; [1] half title; [2] blank; [3] title; [4] COPYRIGHT, 1937, BY LUDWIG BEMELMANS | FIRSTModern LibraryEDITION, 1941; [5] Contents; [6] blank; [7] fly title; [8] blank; 9–10 Foreword; 11–151 text; [152–158] blank.Note:Firststatement retained on all printings. The first printing is on thicker paper than most of the later printings, and there is no list of titles inside the jacket.",
    "Jacket:Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), moderate yellow (87) and black on cream paper with drawing of a fort and cannon in black and moderate greenish blue against moderate yellow background; lettering in black except last two words of title in moderate greenish blue outlined in black. Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition with a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot of the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML jacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the Bemelmans drawing on the title page.",
    "Front flap:",
    "What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’My War with the United Statesfulfils that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a reprint edition.",
    "Originally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. [3], [5]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published October 1941.WR4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948.",
    "The verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement, “Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway Printing Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The ML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset department before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that specialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its standard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible that Parkway subcontracted the job.",
    "There are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a ML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were printed from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset printing.",
    "The jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and the inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings of the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring 1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so they could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.",
    "The ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl Harbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings are on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to enhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset lithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of wartime paper shortages.",
    "The ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and Giant titles."
