    "Hailed for its humanity and power, this odyssey of the Okies as they took flight westward from their dust-ruined land will long remain an important social document. As a fictional account of a migration unique in American history, it will endure as a magnificent work of literature.The Grapes of Wrathis the novel by which John Steinbeck achieved his greatest fame. It is one of four of his books on the Modern Library shelf. The other three areTortilla Flat(No. 216),Of Mice and Men(No. 29) andIn Dubious Battle(No. 115). (Spring 1954)",
    "Originally published by Viking Press, 1939. ML edition (pp. [7]–619) printed from Viking plates. Published October 1941.WR4 October 1941. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1959.",
    "The Viking Press edition led the best-seller list in 1939 with sales of 300,000 copies (Hackett and Burke, p. 127). The ML paid Viking Press a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for non-exclusive reprint rights. There was a ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1942; later printings included 4,000 copies each in May 1943 and June 1944.",
    "The ML edition sold 9,495 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placingThe Grapes of Wrathin the middle of the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales declined to 3,964 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it toward the bottom of the first quarter of titles.",
    "In Chapter 30 (the last chapter) of Viking Press printings, the number of lines per page increases between the fifth printing (May 1939) and ninth printing (September 1939). The first page of Chapter 30 (p. 593) of the ninth printing has one more line than early printings; lines are shifted forward throughout the chapter, with the result that the last page of text (p. 619) has only four lines—five fewer than the fifth printing. The reason for the shift has not been determined. The plates used by the ML reflect the later configuration of Chapter 30.",
    "The ML’s reprint contract appears to have been terminated in 1958 when Viking Press publishedThe Grapes of Wrathin its quality paperback series, Compass Books. The Modern Library edition was discontinued at the end of 1959. Original publishers normally allowed the ML to sell out its existing stock when a reprint contract was terminated.",
