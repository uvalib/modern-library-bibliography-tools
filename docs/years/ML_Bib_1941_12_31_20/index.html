At a time when interest in government, local and national, is of critical importance, the most famous of the Socratic dialogues offers guidance in the principles under which man can live in amity with his fellow-man. Now, just as it had four centuries before the Christian era, Plato’s description of the ideal commonwealth has a special timeliness; it outlines a pattern of government that free men can follow with trust and conviction. This edition includes, in addition to the complete and unabridged text, the Jowett references and marginal notes. ("
