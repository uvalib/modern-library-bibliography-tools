Front flap: After centuries, the derisive phrase “It’s a Marco Polo,” to indicate a gross exaggeration, has been revised to convey the highest tribute for accuracy and veracity. The merchant-traveller from Venice was the first to cross the entire continent of Asia and to open one of the main routes to China. The record of his adventures and explorations is as fabulous as the truth. His is a travel book that time has substantiated. Readers have enjoyed it with a zest worthy of the Venetian nomad himself.
