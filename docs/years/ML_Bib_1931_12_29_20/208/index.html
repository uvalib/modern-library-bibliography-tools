Treasured as one of the greatest achievements in the literature of fiction, it retains all the vitality and contemporaneity of the eternally human. Its unrestrained commentaries on the life of the period, its ridicule of the pretensions and its tolerance of the frailties of mankind, its naturalness and its unforgettable characters, assure the permanence ofTom Jonesthrough the ages.

(Spring 1963) Jacket A:As 208.1b with front flap rewritten: Henry Fielding’s story of a foundling is now more than two hundred years old, but still it has the vitality and appeal it had for its readers in the middle of the eighteenth century. Then, with few predecessors, Fielding created his own form and brought forth a pioneer work of English fiction. Now, with countless imitators, his book is read with the kind of appreciation one reserves for a novel that understands the ageless frailties of mankind and forgives them. A book that makes pretensions ridiculous and shows tolerance for weakness is ageless.Tom Jonesis remembered with affection by readers of every variety for its complete naturalness and for its vivid characters. After two centuries the permanence of Henry Fielding’s novel is assured.

Front flap: Ever since its publication in 1749,Tom Joneshas been a classic of English literature. Unforgettable characters and episodes emerge in its pages: Tom himself—loving, high-spirited, brimming with impetuous vigor; irascible Squire Western with his dogs and drink; Sophia Western, who sees through sham with a gentle “Fie!,” and marvelously understands how to manage her prickly father; Mr. Allworthy, seeker of justice, blinded by his own good heart; Square the philosopher; Mr. Thwackum the divine; the black Blifil; and the author himself, permeating every page with kindly admonitions, scorn of hypocrisy, and admiration of the true virtue found in clarity of vision and a prudent disciplining of the spontaneous urgings of one’s own good nature. Picaresque novel, comic mock epic in prose,Tom Jonesranks in the forefront of world literature. 208.3.

Jacket:Pictorial on kraft paper in strong reddish brown (40) and black with inset woodcut illustration of Tom Jones. Designed by R. D. Scudellari; woodcut illustration by Stephen Alcorn. Front flap: An enormous, exuberant novel of appetite—for food, drink, women, experience—Tom Jonesis, according to Samuel Coleridge, one of the most nearly perfect plots in the world. A foundling, Tom, is discovered one morning by Squire Allworthy and his squarish sister Bridget and brought up as a son in their household until it is time for him to leave and seek not only his fortune but his real identity. Athletic, charismatic, generous, filled with what Fielding called “the glorious lust of doing good” but with a tendency toward dissolution, Tom Jones is one of the first characters in fiction ever to display legitimate sides of good and evil.Tom Jones, the novel is one of the first examples of the “novel of incident,” one which develops character along with plot, and a crucial influence upon the development of modern fiction. Bowers edition originally published in two volumes by Wesleyan University Press, 1975, and reprinted in one volume. ML edition (pp. [3]–982) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition with the following material omitted: dedication (“To Ruthe”), table of contents, list of plates, preface signed by Battestin and Bowers, Battestin’s introduction, fly title (a reproduction of the title page of the 1749 edition), and all appendices (chronology of important dates, select bibliography, index to the corrections, abbreviations used in the notes). The illustrations by Warren Chappell (color plates and line drawings) and the color map on the endpapers are also omitted, as is the list of plates.  Published spring 1985 at $10.95. ISBN 0-394-60519-5. The History of Tom Jones(208.3) is in the 8¼ x 5½ inch format formerly used for ML Giants. Lines 3–4 of the title page are doubly flawed: Battestin’s introduction is not included in the ML edition, and Battestin’s name is misspelled. The full-page color and black-and-white illustrations by Warren Chappell in the one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition were originally created for the Illustrated Modern Library edition ofThe History of Tom Jones(IML 5, 1943). Chappell’s black-and-white vignettes at the head of the dedication, each of the eighteen books, and the end of the Illustrated Modern Library edition are omitted; in their place the Wesleyan University Press substitutes two flourishes and a swelled rule at the head of the introduction, a swelled rule and fluerons below the heading for each book, and a drawing of a couple walking arm-in-arm at the end of the text. All of these illustrations are omitted from the ML edition, which otherwise is a photographic reproduction of pp. [3]–982 of Wesleyan University Press edition, printed by offset lithography with the type page photographically reduced in size.
