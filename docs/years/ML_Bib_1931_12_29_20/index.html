At that time the original edition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a reprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August 1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint. Cerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of the original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told Houghton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be taken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin had reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It will be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very proud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930)."

Cerf did not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the one-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin reduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s to 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for writing the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930)."

With a wealth of realistic detail, with constant access to the private records in the possession of Hadrian and with a first-hand supply of scandalous anecdote, Suetonius enriched history with his vivid portraits of the flesh and blood Caesars. The veracity and impartiality of this record of personalities and events have made it endure through the centuries. ("

Cerf suggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates (Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates, and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933)."

It seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather, and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the contract?"

Two French missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese, knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe, using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the New Mexican way of life."
