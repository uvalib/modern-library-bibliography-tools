Front flap: It is generally conceded by critics, and certainly it is staunchly maintained by hosts of readers, that Arnold Bennett’s most notable literary achievement isThe Old Wives’ Tale. This chronicle of the Five Towns and France during the Siege of Paris is a project of heroic proportions, accomplished with infinite skill, and of a scope that invites comparison with the greatest novels of the Victorian era. It is a tale of ordinary people during extraordinary times, told with an insight encountered only in the works of the masters of fiction. (Spring 1935) Originally published in U.S. by Hodder & Stoughton, 1909. New bibliographical edition with preface by Bennett published by George H. Doran Co., 1911, and subsequently by Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting that Doubleday, Doran appears to have made for the ML’s exclusive use. Published January 1931.WR14 February 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1972. Cerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four long-sought Doubleday titles—Bennett’sOld Wives’ Tale, Maugham’sOf Human Bondage(199), Walpole’sFortitude(201), and Huxley’sPoint Counter Point(203)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML had exclusive reprint rights toThe Old Wives’ Taleand paid Doubleday, Doran a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of 3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in 1933. Cerf stated in 1946 thatThe Old Wives’ Tale“remains, year in and year out, one of the most popular novels in the Modern Library” (Cerf, “Trade Winds,”SRL29, 24 August 1946, p. 18). The Old Wives’ Talewas the third best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,816 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. 207b.Title page reset (c.1940) [within single rules] [7-line title and statement of responsibility within second single-rule frame] THE | OLD | WIVES’ | TALE | BY | ARNOLD | BENNETT | [below inner frame: torchbearer D6 at right; 3-line imprint at left] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK Pagination and collation s 207a.
