(Fall 1931) Front flap: Since H. G. Wells wroteTono-Bungay, his forays into prophecy and history have made him world famous. Yet it is doubtful whether his later fame was as firmly grounded as the first spontaneous outburst of acclaim given toTono-Bungay. With its appearance, H. G. Wells forced immediate recognition as a major figure in contemporary English letters. Neither time nor all the subsequent writings of the prolific and indefatigable Mr. Wells has dimmed the sparkle and vivacity of this chronicle of chicanery and human credulity. (Fall 1933) Originally published in U.S. by Duffield & Co., 1909. ML edition (225.1, pp. [5-6], [1]–460) printed from Duffield & Green plates. Published December 1931.WR26 December 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. Cerf expressed interest inTono-Bungayin 1929 when he offered Duffield & Green a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated that the offer would stand indefinitely, and these appear to be the terms under which the ML edition was published two years later. The plates became the property of Dodd, Mead & Co. when Dodd, Mead bought Duffield & Green in 1934. By June 1936 ML printings totaled 12,000 copies and sales totaled 10,675 copies.Tono-Bungaysold 4,382 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. 225.1b.

(Spring 1959) An internal RH memo (Regina Spirito to Manny Harper, 5 May 1945) indicates that new plates were being made forTono-Bungayalong with Maugham’sOf Human Bondage(199), Buck’sThe Good Earth(266) and Maugham’sMoon and Sixpence(283). By eliminating running heads, printing more text on each page, and beginning new chapters on the same page as the ending of the preceding chapter, the total number of pages ofTono-Bungaywas reduced from 460 to 400. Although Germany surrendered to the Allies the day before Spirito’s memo was written, the war with Japan continued for another four months. Publishers were subjected to increasingly severe paper rationing during the Second World War, and the crowded typesetting is typical of many books of the period. It is not clear why the table of contents is paginated xix–xii. The new typesetting ofThe Good Earthwas also about 60 pages shorter than the earlier edition.Of Human Bondagewas only 6 pages shorter, and the new typesetting ofMoon and Sixpencewas 27 pages longer.
