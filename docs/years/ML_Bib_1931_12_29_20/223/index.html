(Fall 1931) Front flap: The novel upon which William McFee’s reputation rests most securely isCasuals of the Sea. When it appeared, twenty years ago, he was hailed, with Joseph Conrad, as one of the two greatest story-tellers of the sea. Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against the forces of nature and man’s will. (Spring 1936) Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916. ML edition printed from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new typesetting. Published November 1931.WR5 December 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954. Cerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in January 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly interested inCaptain Macedoine’s Daughter, but McFee appears to have been opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf invited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’sPurple Land(134) and indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the possibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,Casuals of the SeaandCommand, were in the Sun Dial Library, which the ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both novels, but in the end onlyCasuals of the Seawas added. Morley’s introduction toCasuals of the Seawas originally for the Lambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when there was a printing of 1,000 copies. Casuals of the Seasold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. When Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition ofCommandin 1933, Cerf responded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book, but [it] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished somewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de Graff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In 1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights inCasuals of the Seato McFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with McFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to be applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the plates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a copy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946). 223b.Title page reset (c.1940) [torchbearer E3] | [7-line title and statement of responsibility within single rules] CASUALS | OF | THE SEA | BY | WILLIAM McFEE | WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY | CHRISTOPHER MORLEY | [below frame] THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK Pp.
