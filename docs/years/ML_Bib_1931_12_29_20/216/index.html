Jacket:Uniform typographic jacket D. (Spring 1931) Front flap: André Gide combines a rich and supple imagination with a conscience that tolerates no squeamishness in the disclosure of the most personal intimacies. The unspeakable has no existence for him; his service to his own truth is constant and uncompromising. Of the thirty distinguished volumes he has published, many of them rare and unobtainable because of their revelations,The Counterfeitersis his only novel, and he has avowed in his Journal: “Without reserve, I want to pour into it everything.” The translation is complete and unexpurgated. (Spring 1936) Bussy translation originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1931.WR23 May 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1946.The CounterfeiterswithJournal of the Counterfeiterspublished spring 1962 (see 216.2). Cerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition ofThe Counterfeiters, offering a $700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a copy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a copy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was intended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf, 18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size. Knopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication date was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the following year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’sLafcadio’s Adventures, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in spring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait forThe Counterfeiters(Knopf to Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the final reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably similar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for renewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keepThe Counterfeitersin the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any spectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to Knopf, 24 October 1939). The Counterfeiterssold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and Giant sales. 216.1b.Title page reset (1941) The Counterfeiters | LES FAUX-MONNAYEURS | by André Gide |Translated from the French byDOROTHY BUSSY |Introduction byRAYMOND WEAVER | [torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at left] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | [rule] Pp.

(Spring 1962) Jacket:Pictorial in dark greenish yellow (103) and black on coated white paper with small drawing of Gide; title in black, author and series in reverse, other lettering in black. Front flap: The history of world literature during the first half of the twentieth century is now being written. Among the novels of that era a small handful seem assured of permanence. They are Thomas Mann’sThe Magic Mountain, James Joyce’sUlysses, Marcel Proust’sRemembrance of Things Past, and—without question—André Gide’sThe Counterfeiters. Dorothy Bussy’s excellent translation ofLes Faux-Monnayeurswas first published in 1927. To this edition ofThe Counterfeitershas been added the first English translation (by Justin O’Brien, well-known authority on Gide and translator of theJournals of André Gide) of the daybook kept by Gide while writing the novel. This Journal of “The Counterfeiters” (Journal des Faux-Monnayeurs) supplies a unique view into the mind of a great novelist at work. (Spring 1962) Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1951, withThe Counterfeitersprinted from plates of the 1927 Knopf edition andJournal of “The Counterfeiters”printed from a new typesetting. ML edition (pp. [5]–432) printed from Knopf plates.
