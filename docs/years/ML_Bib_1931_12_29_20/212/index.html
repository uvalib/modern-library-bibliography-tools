    "“No more savage book was ever written,” says Carl Van Doren ofGulliver’s Travels. Far from being the children’s book that simple-minded people have made it, Swift’s fierce satire burns with hatred and revenge. It is a book for adults who must perceive beyond the record of imaginary travels among pygmies and giants an account of mankind in all its silly, vicious and hypocritical posturings. Included in this volume are Swift’s bitter comediesA Tale of a TubandThe Battle of the Books. (Fall 1936)",

    "The text ofGulliver’s Travels, according to the Prefatory Note, “is substantially that of the second edition, with the corrections in Ford’s interleaved copy” (p. v).

Together with the original notes from this edition are given a few from Hawkesworth’s edition of Swift’s Works (1755–75) and from Sir Walter Scott’s (1814); these are marked respectively with the initial H and S” (p. vi).

    "At whatever ageGulliver’s Travelsmay be read, it opens new worlds to the imagination. For the child this chronicle of fabulous travels among pygmies and giants is an adventure in strange encounters and dramatic conflicts. For the adult it is a commentary and revelation on the mind and behavior of mankind in all its frauds and attempts at honesty, its fatuous and earnest struggles to live in some kind of amity and its preposterous posturings. It is fierce satire with rich meanings for every age and circumstance; it is pure fantasy and startling reality that explores and exposes the frailty of man. Included in this volume are Swift’s bitterly ironic comediesA Tale of a TubandThe Battle of the Books. (Spring 1951)",
