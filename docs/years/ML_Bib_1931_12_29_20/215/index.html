The purpose of this volume is to bring together the greatest contemporary authorities in anthropology and thereby effect a unity of thought and principle concerning the nature of primitive man. This compilation provides the lay reader with an accurate as well as an authoritative and easily comprehended outline of the most enlightened views on the general subject of anthropology.
