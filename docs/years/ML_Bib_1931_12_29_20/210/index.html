Jacket:Pictorial in moderate yellowish green (136) and black on cream paper depicting a man with pith helmet and pipe against a background of jungle foliage; borders in moderate yellowish green, lettering in black. Signed: Loederer. (Spring 1931) Front flap: Lord Jimis by all odds the most popular novel by Joseph Conrad, as well as one of the most exciting adventure stories ever written. It is the story of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity. Conrad wrote an admirer “I will have no favorites, but I do not feel grieved that you prefer ‘Lord Jim’ to all my other books. I won’t even say that ‘I fail to understand’ . . .” (Spring 1936) Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday & McClure Co., 1900. New bibliographical edition published in Doubleday, Doran & Co.’s Sun Dial Library (1928),The Malay Edition of the Works of Joseph Conrad(1929), and possibly elsewhere. ML edition (pp. [iii], [vii]–417) printed from Sun Dial Library/Malay Edition plates with decorations in the Malay Edition omitted from pp. [iii–iv] and [1–2] of ML printings. Published February 1931.WR21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74. Lord Jimwas the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. The Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included Canadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights when they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers when they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the Macmillan Co. of Canada, soldLord Jimfor five months before Blackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the transgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped sellingLord Jimin Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian sales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards” (Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to Longwell, 4 September 1931). Lord Jimsold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. Conrad’sVictory(238) sold 7,335 copies during the same period. Sales ofLord Jimtotaled 115,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad was one of the best-selling authors in the ML.Lord Jimsold 8,669 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the 11th best-selling title in the regular ML;Victorywas the 15th best-selling title.Nostromo(438), published in November 1951, appears to have lagged behind Conrad’s other titles; it did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML at this period. 210b.Title page reset (c.1940) LORD JIM | BY JOSEPH CONRAD | Introduction by j. donald adams | [torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at left] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | [rule] Pagination and collation as 210a.

Front flap as 210a. (Spring 1941) Front flap revised: Perhaps the most popular of all his novels,Lord Jimis undoubtedly Joseph Conrad’s most exciting adventure story. Its theme of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity and destroyed by his sense of lost honor is one of the most appealing in the literature of idealism. All the powers of a great descriptive artist and a thinker concerned with courage and devotion and the crises of conscience are lavished upon this tale of a man who stakes his life on a high principle and loses. “I will have no favorites,” Conrad wrote to an admirer, “but I do not feel grieved that you preferLord Jimto all my other books.” (Spring 1955) Jacket B:Non-pictorial in pale orange yellow (73) on coated white paper with lettering and decorations in deep reddish orange (36), moderate greenish blue (173) and black, with “O” in title suggesting a compass; background in pale orange yellow simulating parchment.
