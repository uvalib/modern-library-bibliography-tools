    "Katherine Mansfield’s sharp perceptions of significant detail, her vivid strokes of characterization and her ability so sensitively to merge reality with unreality give to her short stories the qualities of a remembered experience rather than those of a tale merely well told. In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for truth so evident in her life and work. (Spring 1934)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp. [5]–255) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1931.WR2 May 1931. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.",
    "Cerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint contract with Knopf in October 1929 forThe Dove’s Nest, paying a $500 advance.The Garden Partywas not considered because an inexpensive reprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML bought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to cancel the contract forThe Dove’s Nestso that the ML could include the more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947).",
    "The Garden Partyhad a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There were printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an additional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies during the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June 1938).The Garden Partysold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern Library during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
