    "The Borgian era, with all its excesses of lust and murder, its monstrous villainies and strange benevolences, is here unfolded in a tapestry of unrestrained color and animation. Frederick Baron Corvo, that unpredictable celebrant of Black Masses and practitioner of bizarre literary heresies, depicts the unbridled licence of the 15th Century with a demoniacal vision and an incandescent brilliance of metaphor.A History of the Borgiasthrows new light on the myths and legends surrounding one of the vilest and most glittering reigns of human depravity. (Spring 1934)",
    "Originally published in U.S. asChronicles of the House of Borgiaby E. P. Dutton, 1901, using sheets of the English edition.

(The ML table of contents erroneously lists appendices.) Published September 1931.WR19 September 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1960.",
    "The ML edition was the first to be set in type and printed in the U.S. Leslie’s introduction, a general study of the life and work of Frederick Rolfe, “Baron Corvo,” originally appeared as the introduction to Corvo’sIn His Own Image(Knopf, 1925) and was reprinted by arrangement with Knopf. The ML omitted several paragraphs of Leslie’s text and altered the sentence beginning, “Hadrian VIIis Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” to “Hadrian VIIwith the possible exception of the Book on the Borgias is Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” (ML, p. xxi).",
