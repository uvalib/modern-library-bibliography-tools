(Fall 1932) Front flap: Concededly the most important autobiography that has yet been written in America,The Education of Henry Adamshas exercised an enormous influence upon a generation now coming into its full maturity. An edition of one hundred copies, printed privately in 1907, had aroused profound admiration among scholars. When it was published in 1918, it immediately won and has since held an assured place among the significant works in American literature. This chronicle of a brilliant career and a constant spiritual quest is one of our great national literary treasures. (Spring 1936) Jacket B:Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), deep red (13) and gold on coated white paper with inset portrait of a young Henry Adams in deep red within a gold frame with city buildings outside frame at left and right; borders in gold, title in reverse on front panel, other lettering in deep red, all against vivid reddish orange background. Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. Front flap as jacket A. (Spring 1938) Privately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade edition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s death. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927 and reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition (pp. [v]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates. Published March 1931.WR28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1978/79. The Education of Henry Adamswas one of the first titles Cerf tried to get after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original edition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a reprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August 1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint. Cerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of the original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told Houghton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be taken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin had reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It will be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very proud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930). He offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two cents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for nonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930; Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf did not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the one-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin reduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s to 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for writing the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930). Scaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library edition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the plates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April 1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid 1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm. Later in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing ofThe Education of Henry Adamsin the format of the new ML Giants series. Around the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special printing of Young’sThe Mediciin the same format that had been made for Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of the first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the publisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.” The Education of Henry Adamswas the thirteenth best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed into the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782 copies. 211b.Title page reset (1941) THE EDUCATION | OF | HENRY ADAMS | BY HENRY ADAMS | INTRODUCTION BY | JAMES TRUSLOW ADAMS | [torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at left] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | [rule] Pp.

Front flap: “Few books have had so unexpected success asThe Education of Henry Adams. Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first published edition appeared. AlthoughThe Educationhad aroused a deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant works in American literature but among those which command a wide and steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation, the influence of the book is markedly increasing.”  — from the Introduction"
