Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s books—The Haunted Bookshopwas also in the Sun Dial Library—and settled onParnassus on Wheels. Publication was announced for August 1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so great,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to bring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML wrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new printing they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had been sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged with Lippincott."
