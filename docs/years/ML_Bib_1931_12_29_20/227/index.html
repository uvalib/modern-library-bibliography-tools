    "Merejkowski’s famous historical trilogy, collectively entitledChrist and Anti-Christ, begins with the volumeThe Death of the Gods(No. 153), continues with the biographical novel,The Romance of Leonardo Da Vinci(No. 138), and comes to a conclusion withPeter and Alexis. Each panel of this triptych is complete and self-contained, yet it links together three epochal periods of world history: the 4th century, the Renaissance and 18th century Russia.Peter and Alexisbecomes the climax of the entire work and thus one of Merejkowski’s most absorbing novels. (Fall 1935)",
    "Originally published in U.S. asThe Romance of Peter the Greatby G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1906, in a different translation. Guerney’s translation was commissioned and originally published by the ML. Publication originally announced for August 1930. Published December 1931.WRnot found.First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941.",
    "The ML edition was published more than a year after its announced publication date. Guerney (as usual) took longer than he anticipated to complete the translation, and Cerf (as usual) expressed frustration and irritation at the delay. Cerf indicated hopefully in February 1931 that the translation was almost finished and that the book should be ready around the first of May (Cerf to Crowder, 11 February 1931). Ten days later he noted, “We have had a lot of trouble having the translation of this book completed” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). A letter in June indicated, “. . . at present we do not know when it will be finished and ready for publication” (ML to John D. Rollo, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 9 June 1931).",
