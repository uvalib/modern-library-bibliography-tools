(Fall 1931)Note:The jacket art by Harold Von Schmidt is from the Knopf jacket; the ML jacket generally echoes that of the Knopf edition. Front flap: Of all the distinguished novels written by Willa Cather, none has brought her greater prestige or a wider circle of readers thanDeath Comes for the Archbishop. This historical chronicle of the apostolic mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity. Its rich humanity and its stirring account of the tenacity of a race giving way to the inevitable make it a memorable book to readers of every shade of religious conviction and literary taste. (Spring 1935) Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [5]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published September 1931.WR19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984. Willa Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to include in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright. Cerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’sMy ÁntoniaorThe Song of the Lark, offering royalties of eight cents a copy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who was then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they approached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint ofDeath Comes for the Archbishop, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint. The ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML printings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies (December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934), 5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the ML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows: 14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). After the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want any of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked Knopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of the contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock after the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf, indicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September 25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following: In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather, and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the contract? . . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936). Knopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from her point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June 1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936.DeathComesfortheArchbishopwas listed in the ML’s spring 1937 catalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to Eayrs, 28 May 1937). In 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, publishedDeath Comes for the Archbishopin its paperback series Vintage Books. 219.2.Reissueformat(1984) WILLA CATHER | [2-line title in reverse within single rules in reverse all on black rectangular panel] DEATH COMES FOR | THE ARCHBISHOP | [below panel: torchbearer N] | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK Pp.

Scudellari; woodcut illustration by Stephen Alcorn. Front flap: Widely regarded as Willa Cather’s masterpiece,Death Comes For The Archbishopis set in the mid-19th century. Two French missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese, knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe, using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the New Mexican way of life. “There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly quiet narrative. It is a severe, purely designed chalice of handbeaten silver, filled to the brim with the white essential wine of love. . . .”  —Saturday Review New bibliographical edition published by Knopf, 1945.
