(Fall 1932 jacket) Jacket:Pictorial in deep yellowish pink (27) and black on cream paper depicting a minstrel with lute; borders in deep yellowish pink, lettering in black. Signed: Loederer. (Spring 1931) Front flap: For more than five centuries Giovanni Boccaccio’sThe Decameronhas stood virtually unchallenged in its supremacy as the world’s greatest collection of tales. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Keats and many other literary immortals found in these Florentine stories a never-failing inspiration and a veritable source book for plot material. To the modern reader,The Decameronaffords undiminished stimulation and pleasure, despite the strictures and the vain attempts at suppression by hysterical censors. Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (Fall 1939) Payne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1931.WR21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a). Cerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure thatThe Decameronwould not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of occasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury Department did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its importation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A. Falk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who indicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include shocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930). The ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to John S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance ofThe Decameron, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American universities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He stated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p. xxii). Cerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously, but Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed foreword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our friend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I rather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors, might shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the title page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees. Cerf assured booksellers in an article inPWthat the Payne translation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying the sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of public morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,”PW119, 14 February 1931, p. 842). Sumner did not challenge the ML edition, butThe Decameronremained a controversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who specialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML jacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any title at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the DROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales representative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of titles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked Lewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised: “Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern maidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a stink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940). The Decameronwas the best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower than in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958. 209.1b.Title page reset (c.1940) THE | DECAMERON | OF | GIOVANNI | BOCCACCIO | TRANSLATED BY | JOHN PAYNE | [torchbearer D3 at right; 3-line imprint at left] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | [rule] Pp.

The ML began to consider a new translation ofThe Decameronin 1953 when Barry Ulanov of Barnard College submitted a six-page sample translation. Stein sent Ulanov’s sample to a number of readers but the response was generally unfavorable. Several readers suggested Frances Winwar’s translation as the best available. Stein wrote Winwar in December to express interest in using her translation (Stein to Winwar, 22 December 1953). She subsequently sent ten pages of revisions that were incorporated into the ML edition. 209.2b.
