    "Few novels of the last ten years have stirred up so much partisanship and violent controversy as Arthur Koestler’sDarkness at Noon. Its champions have proclaimed it as a penetrating study of revolutionary psychology and the compulsions which lead to the catharsis of confession; its adversaries, first to admit its overwhelming power, attack it on the ground of its political implications. Both agree that Arthur Koestler is a novelist of the foremost rank and a man with the courage of his strong and brilliant convictions. (Spring 1946)",
    "Jacket B:As jacket A except last line of front panel: “A Book-of-the-Month Club Selection”. (Spring 1951)Note:Darkness at Noonhad been a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1941. The wording of the jacket may have been revised to avoid the suggestion that it was a current selection. Front flap revised with first sentence beginning “Few modern novels have stirred up” and the following sentence added at the end: “Recent history has provided corroborating testimony to his fictional critique of the ruthlessness of modern revolutionary procedures.” (Fall 1956)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1941. ML edition (pp. [5]–267) printed from Macmillan plates. Publication scheduled for February 1946.WR16 March 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies.",
    "Kostler wroteDarkness at Noonin German while living in Paris. The sculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was Koestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris separately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once she was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication ofDarkness at Noonwith the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August 2013).",
    "Cerf initially wanted to publishDarkness at Noonin the ML in fall 1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I think it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do well with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12 January 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for fall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on the grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our relations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam, Macmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML edition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).",
    "Darkness at Noonwas the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club for June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years later, the ML jacket stated “The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection”; in the early 1950s the wording was changed to “A Book-of-the-Month Club Selection”.",
    "Darkness at Noonsold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles."
