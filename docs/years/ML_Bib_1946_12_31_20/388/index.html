    "Jacket A:Pictorial in brilliant yellow (83), strong orange (50), light grayish brown (60), and black on coated white paper with multi-color illustration at lower right of a smiling author in an easy chair with a portable typewriter resting on his outstretched legs and sheets of typescript scattered on the floor; title in reverse and other lettering in black on inset light grayish brown panel bordered in strong orange, all against brilliant yellow background.

    "The temptation to describe a book by Ogden Nash in his own light-verse style is quickly overcome by mere trial. The simple truth is that he is inimitable. He is [+original, he is] funny and he is profound; he is clever and he is surprisingly penetrating; there are always both rhyme and reason in his sensible nonsense. For this Modern Library edition, Ogden Nash has made his own selection of 165 of his most representative poems, each one a gem of humor and light-hearted wisdom. (Spring 1946; [Fall 1956])",
    "Jacket B:As jacket A in vivid red (71) instead of strong orange and grayish brown (61) instead of light grayish brown. Front flap as jacket A fall 1956. (Spring 1963)",
    "Original ML collection. Publication announced for April 1946.WR17 August 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1968, four years after Nash’sVerses from 1929 On(1964) was added to the ML.",
    "Cerf first inquired about a volume of Nash’s poems in 1943, remarking: “We are veering more and more to the classics in the Modern Library, but we have to put in an occasional modern volume to keep up appearances” (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 1 October 1943). At that time Little, Brown did not want to authorize another reprint edition of Nash’s poems. Garden City Publishing Co. was doing well with its one-dollar reprint ofThe Face Is Familiar: The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash, andThe Ogden NashPocket Bookwas scheduled to appear as a 25-cent paperback early the following year (McIntyre to Cerf, 2 October 1943). The Garden City reprint, published in 1941, eventually went through fifteen printings for a total of 172,500 copies; the Pocket Books volume had nine printings through January 1946 for a total of 765,000 copies (Crandell, pp. 58–60, 76).",
    "The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy to Little, Brown & Co. In 1957 Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown noted that the ML was still paying royalties of 10 cents a copy although the retail price had been increased several times (Thornhill to Klopfer, 17 September 1957). Royalties appear to have been increased to 12 cents a copy.",
    "The Selected Verse of Ogden Nashsold 5,332 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles."
