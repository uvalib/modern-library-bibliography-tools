Signed: VA [Valenti Angelo]. Front flap: Of the new generation of novelists, risen to prominence during the Second World War, no one stands higher than John Hersey. InA Bell for Adanohe has given the first fictional, and so far the most eloquent, American interpretation of the struggle of democracy against fascism. He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world. (Spring 1946) Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp. [1]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946.WR27 April 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956. The ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a copy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in 1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A Pocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945. Hersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in place of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar rather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins: For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began: “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.” On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two things. One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . . The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men, when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones, when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii). Commins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever to appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November 1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in the Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not “consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere else” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf edition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint editions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more than thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued. Copies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of the volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and jacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author stamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and title printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is indicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used on ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as regular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for the use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown. The ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952."
