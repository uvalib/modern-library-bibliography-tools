Jacket:Pictorial in dark yellowish green (137), vivid reddish orange (34), light yellow (86), brownish orange (54), grayish blue (186) and black on coated white paper; background in dark yellowish green with inset panel in light moderate yellow with title and author in vivid reddish orange and multi-color illustration of a boy in grayish blue pants kneeling on the ground with his arm around a brownish orange fawn. Front flap: As American a book asTom SawyerorHuckleberry Finn,The Yearlinghas achieved for itself within a few years a permanent place in our national literature. It is a novel of living characters in an unforgettable setting, with a wisdom as simple as it is tender and a charm as natural as it is winning. The story of Jody Baxter and his pet fawn is American folklore at its best.The Yearlingis a novel that stirs the heart with its understanding of boyhood and its love of life. (Fall 1946) Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1938. New bibliographical edition with illustrations by N. C.Wyeth published as “Pulitzer Prize Edition,” 1939, and in Scribner Illustrated Classics for Younger Readers, 1940. ML edition (pp. 1–400) printed from offset lithographic plates photographically reduced from the 1939 Scribner edition with illustrations omitted. Publication announced for September 1946.WR4 January 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1954. The ML paid Scribner’s royalties of 10 cents a copy on all copies sold over 30,000. The royalty on the first 30,000 copies appears to have been reduced or waived to cover the cost of making offset plates. Sales appear to have exceeded 30,000 copies since the ML paid Scribner’s royalties of $235 on sales of 2,355 copies sold after 30 October 1953 (Klopfer to Ruth Riggs, Scribner’s, 16 July 1954). The ML’s reprint contract was limited to six years. After receiving a report of sales through October 1953 and noting thatThe Yearlingwas included on the ML’s spring 1954 list, Whitney Darrow of Scribner’s reminded Cerf that the book was supposed to have been dropped from the series by October 1952 (Darrow to Cerf, 19 April 1954). Klopfer replied thatThe Yearlinghad stayed on the spring 1954 list by mistake and as a result it had not been necessary to remainder any copies. He assured Darrow that it was out of stock and would be replaced on the fall list by Aristotle’sRhetoric & Poetics(Klopfer to Darrow, 20 April 1954). The Yearlingwas not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1952–October 1953.",
