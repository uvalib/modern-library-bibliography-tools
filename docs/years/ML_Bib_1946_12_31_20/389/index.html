Publication announced for September 1946.WR16 November 1946. First printing: Not ascertained but probably 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1969/70."

The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the assumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML thatThe Wings of the Dovedid not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve large reprint sales."

The New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type. The ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s edition and made plates that were used for ML printings."

      "#text": "Four years beforeThe Wings of the Dovewas added to the ML, Cerf admitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf to Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote, “According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a motion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the Dove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make a timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report, however, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is one of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than Faulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political dissertations” (“Trade Winds,”SRL, June 20, 1942, p. 20)."
