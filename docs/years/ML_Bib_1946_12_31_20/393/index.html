    "For more than a quarter of a century Robert Frost has maintained a position of unrivaled honor among living American poets. Associated generally with New England, his works have transcended sectional limitations and have become the lyrical voice of the entire land. Not only has Robert Frost chosen 230 of his 270 published poems [±230 of his poems for this collection], but he also contributes a personal credo in the form of an Introductory Essay, “The Constant Symbol,” and a new sonnet written especially for this volume. (Fall 1946; [Spring 1955])",
    "Original ML collection published by arrangement with Henry Holt & Co. Published November 1946.WR14 December 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1963.",
    "Cerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in 1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later Robert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the year, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated that the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid for and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write an introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944). It took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the delay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan conveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include every poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of Frost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and Pocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945).The Pocket Book of Robert Frost’s Poemswas published in 1946 andThe Complete Poems of Robert Frost(Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern Library contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500 advance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract was for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless terminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.",
    "Linscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems inThe Collected Poems of Robert Frost(Holt, 1939) andA Witness Tree(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott to Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided that he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four of the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had left out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to Mr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by way of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but instead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13 December 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four poems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The Mountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter Night,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue Ribbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking with Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the contents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only “The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection. Linscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages (Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The Constant Symbol,” was also published inAtlantic Monthly(October 1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost appended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.",
    "The Poems of Robert Frostsold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.",
    "No details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been ascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt, Rinehart & Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in 1963."
