Jacket:Pictorial on cream paper in moderate brown (58), dark bluish green (165), and black, with inset illustration by Hugo Steiner-Prag of a small figure seated by a lake with mountains in the distance and three trees in the foreground, all in moderate brown with dark bluish green frame; illustration framed in dark bluish green (165), lettering in dark bluish green and black, all within black and dark bluish green rules. Front flap: For almost two hundred yearsThe Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseauhas remained unchallenged as the classic book of self-revelation. A tremendous influence on subsequent writing, it is as meaningful for our generation as it was before, during and immediately after the French Revolution. The very voice of the enlightenment, it speaks with the same eloquence for every enlightened reader today. The inclusion ofThe Confessions, complete and unabridged, in the Modern Library series fulfills a long-cherished plan of the editors. (Spring 1946)Note:The jacket illustration is credited to Steiner-Prag on the front flap; Joseph Blumenthal was responsible for the typographic design. (Spring 1946) The ML did not know the identity of the translator. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Scheduled for fall 1945; published February 1946.WR9 February 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. The Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseauwas scheduled for publication in fall 1945, and the verso of the title page of the first printing states “FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION, 1945.” However, its listing inPublishers’ Weekly’s “Weekly Record” of newly published books is in the issue for 9 February 1946, and there is a spring 1946 list of ML titles inside the first printing of the jacket. Publication may have been delayed by the wave of strikes that accompanied the return to a peacetime economy (seeNeavill, “Publishing in Wartime,”Library Trends55 [Winter 2007], p. 593; http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/slisfrp/62). Klopfer remarked later in 1946, “We are having the usual hellish time getting our books out and the situation amongst the suppliers is certainly no easier than it was at any time during the war” (Klopfer to Cerf, 14 August 1946). The ML edition was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 45,924 copies by spring 1958.",
