(Spring 1946) Jacket A:Pictorial in moderate blue (182), light yellow (86), medium gray (265), and black on coated white paper with decorative illustration of deerstalker cap, pipe and magnifying glass; lettering in reverse shaded in light yellow, medium gray, and black against black background shaded in moderate blue. Signed: PG [Paul Galdone]. Front flap: For many years the editors of the Modern Library have tried to acquire the rights of publication of the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Now, by special arrangement with the Estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, complete and unabridged in one volume and comprising twenty-three of the greatest tales to come from the pen of the master, is offered as the classic in its field. Here for your mystification and delight are “The Red-Headed League,” “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” “The Five Orange Pips” and others of equal fame and favor. (Spring 1946) ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for February 1946.WR6 July 1946. First printing: Probably 10,000 copies. Cerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about includingThe Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmesin the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and make new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a way of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 April 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred Cerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle Estate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being difficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a period of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible limitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes stories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944). Klopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with Watt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped its proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a three-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt to drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML would be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer, 4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is included in Cerf and Klopfer,Dear Donald, Dear Bennett, pp. 195–98). He also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was considering puttingThe Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmesinto the Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that, although the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years and he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at ten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed to a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five years. Vincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the ML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I would rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of the American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty corrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was published without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a first printing of 10,000 copies. The ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placingThe Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmeshigh in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. 387b.
