    "Beethoven, the man and the creator, emerges in all his humanity and genius from the pages of this book. The events of his life and the circumstances under which he wrote his majestic music are presented with the purpose of giving the general reader a faithful portrait. In addition, more than one hundred of the works are analyzed so that the concertgoer, phonograph enthusiast and the radio listener will have program notes, with appraisals and interpretations. The author, John N. Burk, is the historian of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. (Fall 1946)",
    "Originally published by Random House, 1943. ML edition (pp. v–483) printed from RH plates with frontispiece portrait of Beethoven omitted. Publication announced for November 1946.WR14 December 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "Burk was a music historian affiliated with the Boston Symphony. His program notes about works being performed were included in the printed programs, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on Boston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’sClara Schumann: A Romantic Biographyin 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf and Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins suggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and one-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works (Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by Random House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML edition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter.",
    "The Life and Works of Beethovenwas not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. It sold about 2,000 copies a year in the mid-1950s; Cerf reported in 1960 that it sold “only moderately well” (Cerf to Selden Rodman, 8 June 1960).",
    "Burk indicated that his typescript was almost exactly 100,000 words and that his first choice of someone to write an introduction was Aaron Copeland, with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony, as another possibility (Burk to Commins, 13 July 1942 and 27 November 1942; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library). In the end the book was published without an introduction.",

    "Jacket: As jacket A.(Fall 1954)",
    "The list of phonograph records consisted of 78 rpm recordings and was woefully out of date by 1954, six years after the introduction of the long-playing record (LP). Burk suggested deleting the list, and Commins indicated that it would be removed from subsequent printings (Burk to Commins, 10 July 1954; Commins to Burk, 22 July 1954).",
