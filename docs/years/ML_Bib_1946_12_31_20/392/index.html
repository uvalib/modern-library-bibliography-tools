The author, John N. Burk, is the historian of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. (Fall 1946)"

His program notes about works being performed were included in the printed programs, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on Boston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’sClara Schumann: A Romantic Biographyin 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf and Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins suggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and one-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works (Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by Random House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML edition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000 copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter."
