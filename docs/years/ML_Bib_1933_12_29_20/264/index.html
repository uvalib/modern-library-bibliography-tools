    "Remembrance of Things Pastis the general title for the seven magnificent novels of Marcel Proust. One by one, the independent parts are being made available for Modern Library readers, all in the masterful translations of C. K. Scott Moncrieff. . . .The Guermantes Wayis the third of the series. These novels should be read in their proper order, that their subtlety and depth may be savored to the full. (Fall 1933)",
    "Originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Thomas Seltzer, 1925; reprinted 1928 by Albert & Charles Boni. ML edition (pp. [7–9], 1–428; 1–395) printed from Seltzer/Boni plates in one volume with part titles added and headings “Part I” and “Part II” added to the table of contents. Published December 1933.WR23 December 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "Fifteen months after the ML edition ofWithin a Budding Grove(194) was published Cerf wrote to Albert Boni about addingThe Guermantes Wayto the series in fall 1931 or spring 1932 (Cerf to Boni, 17 April 1931). Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set ofRemembrance of Things Pastwould be undermined if individual volumes appeared in the ML too rapidly. Cerf approached him again a few months later with an offer that he hoped would entice Boni to release the work for publication in spring 1932. He offered an advance of $1,500 payable immediately, or $2,000 with half paid on signing and the balance on publication, against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Boni, 3 July 1931). The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year and specified that the ML edition could not be published before October 1933. The ML paid Boni a $1,500 advance with $750 payable on signing (Cerf to Boni, 23 November 1932).",
    "Swann’s Way(166) was the only Proust title to achieve consistently good sales in the ML.The Guermantes Waysold 1,997 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth worst-selling title. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
