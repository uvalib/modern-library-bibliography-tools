    "In her introduction to her sister’s novel,Wuthering Heights, Charlotte Brontë wrote: “The writer who possesses the creative gift owns something that strangely wills and works for itself.” This observation has an especial application to her ownJane Eyre, for it emphasizes the reasons for the vitality and individuality of one of the most highly cherished treasures in our literature. Since it is partially autobiographical, the poignancy ofJane Eyreis linked to the deathless interest and the heart rending pathos of the lives of the Brontës. (Fall 1933)",
    "ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published August 1933.WR2 September 1933. First printing: Not ascertained.",
    "Jane Eyrewas the first ML book to include descriptive text about the work on the jacket flap. Descriptive text about each ML title appeared on the front panel of the jacket from May 1917 through spring 1928. For the next five years (fall 1928–July 1933) ML jackets included information about the series as a whole on the front flap but nothing specifically about individual works. Saxe Commins, who joined Random House as editor in July 1933, wrote the flap text forJane Eyreand subsequently published ML titles. As jackets of older ML titles were reprinted, he provided flap text about those works as well.",
    "Sales ofJane Eyreincreased substantially during the Second World War. There were nineteen printings between 1933 and early 1944 for a total of 37,000 copies. Of these, 10,453 copies were sold during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placingJane Eyrein the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, just above Thackeray’sVanity Fair. It sold 3,502 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it near the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.Vanity Fair, with sales of 5,390 copies, retained a solid position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.",

    "The ML reset the text for the Illustrated ML (IML 8) and subsequently used the plates for regular ML printings. The full page illustrations in Illustrated Modern Library printings are omitted, but two of Edward A. Wilson’s drawings are retained—the decorative vignette of two birds at the beginning of the Preface (p. v) and the illustration of a barren tree at the head of Chapter One (p. 3).",
    "The first word or two of each chapter is set in Lilith, a decorated typeface designed by Lucian Bernhard in 1930. Hutchings describes it as a “twentieth century parody of Victorian decorated typefaces” and “a pastiche of some or the more notable design features of the 1840–50 decade. The collared main-strokes to the capitals, bifurcated terminals, horizontal hatching, and formalized shadow effect are characteristic of the period, although the swash forms of the capitals and the inclusion of lower-case were then exceptional” (Manual of Decorated Typefaces, p. 54).",
