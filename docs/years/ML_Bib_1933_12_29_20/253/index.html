    "Jacket:Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173) and black on light gray paper depicting two penguins on a jagged mound of ice; borders in moderate greenish blue, lettering in black with title highlighted in moderate greenish blue. (Fall 1932)",
    "A. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co., 1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American branch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made from a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published January 1933.WR4 February 1933. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.",
    "The original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format. For its edition of France’sRevolt of the Angels(163), published in 1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off the running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the headline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was one of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf considered doing the same forPenguin Island(Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4 November 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The result was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages shorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.",
    "The ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the translator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years after the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of the title page of 253c, published in 1984.",
    "The ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s (an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939) but picked up in the 1940s.Penguin Islandsold 4,876 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
    "The publication ofPenguin Islandbrought the number of France’s works in the ML to five.The QueenPédauquewas discontinued at the end of 1933; by the end of 1942Penguin Islandwas the only title by France in the series.",

    "First published in 1908, and widely regarded as his masterpiece,Penguin Islandis Anatole France’s most searching and satirical novel. A humorous critique of customs and laws, rituals and rites, its subject is human nature, but its characters are penguins in the mythical land of Penguinia. The story of the strutting penguins and their virtues and vices is not merely a burlesque allegory of French history, it is a satire of the history of mankind. With gentle yet biting irony, France challenges the Spencerian belief in the ultimate perfectability [sic] of man, though his irony reveals his sympathy for man’s weaknesses and his need for social institutions.",
