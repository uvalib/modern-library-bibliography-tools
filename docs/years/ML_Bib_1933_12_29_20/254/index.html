    "On one question, at least, critics and readers of Sinclair Lewis’s works are likely to agree—Arrowsmithis his greatest novel. In it the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature has created a gallery of characters which, it is safe to predict, will remain unforgettable for generations. Leora, the indomitable comrade and wife; Gottlieb, the incorruptible scientist; Sondelius, the crusader against plagues; and Arrowsmith, the doctor in whom a holy flame is kindled—\tthese are characters who give to the novel its immense power and its blazing indignation. (Spring 1936)",
    "Originally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1925. ML edition (254.1, pp. [iii], 1–448) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February 1933.WR4 March 1933. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1952.",
    "The ML edition (254.1a) was larger than the standard 6½ x 4¼ inch format so that it could be printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Publication of the ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film version starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the appearance of Lewis’s new novelAnn Vickers.The ML urged booksellers to feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement,PW, 14 January 1933, p. 98).",
    "The ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset & Dunlap, which also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace plates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the original Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier & Son.",
    "Arrowsmithsold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, makingArrowsmiththe thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153 copies ahead of Hemingway,A Farewell to Arms.",
    "Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college market. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts forArrowsmith, Lewis’sBabbitt, and seven other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML’s contract forArrowsmithhad four years to run. Harcourt, Braceconfirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the firm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to Klopfer, 28 April 1952).",

    "Printed from Harcourt, Brace plates made from a new typesetting. The plates were also used for the Harcourt, Brace “Text Edition” (1945), edited by Barbara Grace Spayd with extensive preliminary and back matter that not included in ML printings. Beginning in 1952, shortly after the ML edition was discontinued, Harcourt, Brace used the plates for printings in Harbrace Modern Classics.",
    "The type page in the new edition is taller and wider than the original Harcourt, Brace typesetting used for 254.1 and consists of two fewer lines, resulting in a more open, less densely packed page. In ML printings this is achieved at the cost of significantly narrower margins. The inside margins are about 7 mm each, and the top margin is a mere 6 mm. The lack of a headline in the new typesetting makes the narrow top margin in ML printings particularly noticeable; the transfer of page numerals from the headline to the foot of the page compensates visually for the slightly narrower margin at the foot. The new plates were better suited to the larger format of Harbrace Modern Classics.",
