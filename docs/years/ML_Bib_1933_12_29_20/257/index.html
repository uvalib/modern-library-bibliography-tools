    "To Pierre Louÿs, as it was to the Greeks, love is the most virtuous of human sentiments. His famous story of the courtesan of Alexandria is as unashamedly voluptuous as it is true to the period of antiquity in which it transpires. WhenAphroditefirst appeared a storm of wrath was whipped up by the guardians of morality. TodayAphroditeis accepted by discriminating readers on its own merits as a novel of sensual beauty, written in a rapturous prose, without shame and without sin. (Spring 1939)",
