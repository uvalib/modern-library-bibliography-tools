(Fall 1933) Front flap: The anthologist does not live who can compile a collection of short stories and avoid loud protests for his omissions. In the field of the German short story the choice is so wide that an inclusion of all favorites would make a volume of encyclopedic bulk. This anthology puts forth a comprehensive group of short novels and tales, selected primarily because they are representative of the main currents of German literature and those great national figures—Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Zweig and others—who made it the world’s heritage. (Fall 1934) Original ML anthology. Published April 1933.WR29 April 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 byGreat German Short Novels and Stories, ed. Victor Lange (451). Thomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology of German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February 1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed responsibility for the anthology: It was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a considerable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He expressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract was duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still roaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled. At long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German authors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with the job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to gather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and exercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to the publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the wastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii) Hitler came to power shortly beforeGreat German Short Novels and Storieswas published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the volume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf, 17 April 1933). WhenGreat German Short Novels and Storieswas being planned Cerf contacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’sDeath in Venice, offering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a Thomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been published in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf had published Kenneth Burke’s translation ofDeath in Veniceas a separate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T. Lowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the out-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against royalties of 3 cents a copy for its use. Great German Short Novels and Storiessold 4,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. 256b.
