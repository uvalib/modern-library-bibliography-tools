(Spring 1933) Front flap: Now that Becky Sharp, the heroine ofVanity Fair, is to step forth upon the screen, new interest in Thackeray’s masterpiece has been aroused. By bringing to the public the unforgettable experience of reading such a novel, the Modern Library fulfills a function of incalculable value. To be able to offerVanity Fair, with Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches, in one complete and reasonably priced volume of 784 pages, is a publishing venture of which we may be pardonably proud. (Spring 1935) Bibliographical edition originally published in Britain by Thomas Nelson & Sons in its New Century Library and probably other formats, c. 1900. ML edition (258.1) printed from Nelson plates. Published June 1933.WR1 July 1933. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1970.

During the same period Dickens’sDavid Copperfield(269) sold 8,685 copies and Thackeray’sHistory of Henry Esmond(297) sold 4,409 copies.Vanity Fairsold 5,390 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles—and still ahead ofDavid Copperfieldwhich sold 4,798 copies. 258.1b.

Jacket:As 258.1b. Front flap rewritten: As story aloneVanity Fairis read and cherished by each new generation with increased absorption and admiration. One hundred years after its first publication it still retains its original vitality and makes the world in which Becky Sharp and its many other memorable characters lived as meaningful as our own. Few, if any, novels in English give so comprehensive a picture of the structure of its society, ranging from the aristocracy, the gentry, the merchants, the military, the colonials and the bohemians to the lowly and the impecunious.Vanity Fairis a panoramic novel that makes a startling commentary on its own times and customs with wit and audacity and perception. It is one of the imperishable classics of English fiction. This volume is embellished by Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches. (Spring 1951) Front flap rewritten: When it was written over one hundred years ago, Thackeray describedVanity Fairas “a novel without a hero.” If it did lack a central protagonist, his great work more than compensated for this deliberate omission with a gallery of memorable characters now known and beloved by readers of every shade of taste and opinion. To be able to issueVanity Fair, with Thackeray’s own pen and pencil sketches, in a single volume of 784 [sic] pages, complete and unabridged, fulfills the first aim of the Modern Library: to make available the greatest book treasures of the past and present in a convenient and inexpensive form. (Fall 1954) Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Early in 1950 Stein contacted Gordon S. Ray, chairman of the English department at the University of Illinois and the preeminent Thackeray scholar in the United States, to see if he would be willing to write an introduction to the MLCE edition ofVanity Fairinstead of Thackeray’sHistory of Henry Esmond(297) as previously arranged. Stein described the conversation in a memo to Haas: What came back over the telephone wire was a very blistering attack upon our edition of VANITY FAIR. He said that he uses the edition in his classes with reluctance and that he always apologizes to them for having to use it. His principal points of complaint are: 1) Our edition is not based on the final text. 2) Our edition does not include Thackeray’s own preface to the book. 3) Our edition is full of typographic errors. 4) We do not reproduce Thackeray’s own illustrations. I am checking into the text of VANITY FAIR to find out exactly what is involved in producing a completely satisfactory book and will let you know within a few days what I turn up. Next Friday Ray will be in town and I have an appointment with him. Naturally I hope that I can at that time assure him that we will put out a completely satisfactory edition. At the moment the principal inexpensive editions of VANITY FAIR that are available are Modern Library, Everyman’s Library, and Great Illustrated Classics (Dodd, Mead, $2.50). Neither Harper nor Rinehart has an edition of VANITY FAIR available right now, but Rinehart does have one in preparation. It seems imperative therefore that we have our edition of VANITY FAIR in improved form available this fall (Stein memo to Haas, 10 February 1950). Ray indicated that the 1864 edition with revisions by Thackeray should be followed. Stein believed that the text of the 1933 ML edition followed Thackeray’s original text as published in parts, 1847–48. At first he hoped that the existing plates could be used for the new ML edition. He told Ray, “Naturally I don’t want our text to be one which does not have scholarly approval. I don’t know yet whether a collation or a resetting is our solution but we will do one or the other to bring the text completely in line with the 1864 version. Because of production costs I am not sure yet that the illustrations, vignettes and initial letters can be included in as moderately priced a book as we plan to have” (Stein to Ray, 28 March 1950). In the end the ML reset the text (Stein to Ray, 20 June 1950) and included eight of Thackeray’s illustrations along with facsimiles of the title page of the first edition and the wrapper of one of the original monthly parts. Earlier ML printings (258.1) included the two facsimiles and three of Thackeray’s illustrations. Ray appears to have declined Stein’s suggestion that he write an introduction toVanity Fairinstead ofHistory of Henry Esmond, and Stein offered Joseph Warren Beach $200 to write the introduction. Beach replied that he would take on the assignment for $500 but later agreed to accept the amount offered (Stein to Beach, 25 January 1950; Beach to Stein, 27 January 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 27 February 1950). The ML’s goal, Stein told Beach, was to produce “an inviting edition that can be enjoyed by the American student as a novel as readable today as it was a century ago” (Stein to Beach, 23 May 1950). The Note on the Text stated: The present Modern Library edition ofVanity Fairis based on the 1864 edition, which represents the final revisions made by Thackeray, and is preferable to earlier editions as representing what Thackeray considered improvements. Certain obvious misprints in the earlier and later editions have been corrected. In the case of certain doubtful readings we have followed the Oxford edition ofVanity Fairedited by Saintsbury in 1908, but we have not always accepted Saintsbury’s emendations. A few of Thackeray’s own full-page illustrations, of which there were some forty in all, have been included—enough to give a notion of the quaint visual aids offered the reader of what Thackeray called “these histories in their gaudy yellow covers”; but considerations of expense make it impossible to include the still more numerous sketches at the head of each chapter or set into the text.
