    "“Three Lives,” says the Saturday Review, “stands as a massive doorpost in the entrance to the latest and best in American literature.” The book has had a curious history. Readers who were baffled by Gertrude Stein’s later work were afraid to tackle it. Twice it was allowed to go out of print altogether. Each time, however, enthusiastic admirers created sufficient demand to warrant new printings. The emphatic success of Miss Stein’s autobiography must finally win for this splendid book the wide audience that is its due. (Fall 1933)",
    "Originally published by Grafton Press, 1909. Reprinted by Albert & Charles Boni, 1927. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–279) printed from Grafton/Boni plates. Published September 1933.WR7 October 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941.",
    "After Harcourt, Brace & Co. published Stein’sAutobiography of Alice B. Toklasin 1933, Carl Van Vechten suggested that the ML bring out some of Stein’s earlier work. Cerf cabled Stein in Paris about a ML edition ofThreeLives(Cerf,At Random, p. 101). RH subsequently became Stein’s regular publisher, and a warm friendship developed between Cerf and Stein.",
    "The ML acquired the plates and full publishing rights toThree Lives, and Van Vechten wrote a new introduction for the ML edition. Cerf informed Stein a month after publication that “the book is proving to be a tremendous success for us. It is causing more comment than any new Modern Library title in the past two years. The firm of R. H. Macy & Co., which has probably the largest book department in the world today, has bought the astonishing number of 1300 copies of this little book since publication day less than a month ago. The total sale to date is over 4500 copies” (Cerf to Stein, 23 October 1933).",
    "Sales appear to have dropped off in the later 1930s, andThree Liveswas discontinued at the end of 1940. Cerf persuaded James Laughlin of New Directions to addThree Livesto their New Classics series in 1941. New Directions used the ML’s plates, including Van Vechten’s introduction, and paid the ML a $250 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf told Stein that she would receive $125 (her half of the advance) from the New Directions edition in the next year alone (Cerf to Stein, 17 September 1941).",
