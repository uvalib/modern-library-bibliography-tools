    "With the publication ofEminent Victoriansin 1918, the art of biography was given a new impetus. The astonishing brilliance of Lytton Strachey’s portraits illuminated the hidden facets of his subjects as well as the motives and tendencies of the era in which they lived. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s graphic and vivacious methods, and the present-day enthusiasm for biographical literature is directly traceable to his innovating technique. Strachey himself consideredEminent Victorianshis finest work. (Fall 1933)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1918; publishing rights and plates subsequently acquired by Harcourt, Brace & Co. ML edition printed from Harcourt, Brace plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1933.WR9 December 1933. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "Harcourt, Brace acquired the rights toEminent Victoriansafter publishing Strachey’sQueen Victoria(1921) andElizabeth and Essex(1928). When Cerf expressed interest in a Strachey title for the ML, Alfred Harcourt replied that neitherQueen VictorianorElizabeth and Essexwould be available since the firm wanted to promote them as textbooks after a reprint contracts held by Blue Ribbon Books expired. He indicated that the ML could haveEminent Victoriansin June 1933 when the Star Dollar Books edition published by Garden City Publishing Co. would be exhausted (Harcourt to Cerf, 27 September 1932). The following April he reported that the Star edition was out of print and thatEminent Victorianswas available whenever the ML wanted it (Harcourt to Cerf, 21 April 1933). The original plates were too large for the ML’s format and Harcourt, Brace made new plates for the ML edition, for which the ML was billed $500. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy.",
    "Eminent Victorianssold 2,967 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

    "Before the publication ofEminent Victoriansthe art of biography had fallen into a decline that made of most lives a journeyman’s compilation of volumes commemorating the dead. To the task of putting an end to this kind of literary abomination, Lytton Strachey brought many special qualifications. Of these, the most notable were his acute sense of the past, a scholarship both accurate and spirited, and a vivid style. Modern biographers quickly adopted Lytton Strachey’s graphic and vitalizing methods, and the current enthusiasm for works of biography is directly traceable to his innovations. By unanimous consentEminent Victoriansis his most noteworthy book. In it he evaluates the lives and times of Cardinal Manning, Florence Nightingale, Dr. Thomas Arnold of Rugby and General Charles George (Chinese) Gordon. (Spring 1959)",
