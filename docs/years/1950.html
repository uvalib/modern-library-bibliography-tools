<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1950</h1>
<h2>1950</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library
College Editions. All of the early titles were taken from the regular
Modern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold
initially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular
Modern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they
were issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward
the academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a
distinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new
series had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath
Brooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson,
Royal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray,
Mark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and
Morton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in
regular Modern Library printings as well.</p>
<p>Many of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken
over the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often
than not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met.
In contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College
Editions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They
were, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was
beginning to eat into the Modern Library’s college market with their
regular Modern Library series.</p>
<p>That series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart &amp; Co. in late
1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics
aimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to
seventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound
volumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were
well-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics.</p>
<p>The Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess
Stein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions
from the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore
orders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and
Illinois.</p>
<p>The Random House juvenile department, already well established with such
authors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to
the firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched
in 1950.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Nine new titles were added and four discontinued in the regular ML
series, bringing the total titles to 276. There were an additional 74
titles in the Giants. The Modern Library College Editions launched with
41 titles of non-royalty-bearing works.</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph
Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created
the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making
electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format
was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth
linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray
cloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a
contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Each printing of a
given title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset
panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s
torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the
spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the
colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was
stamped in gold.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>$1.25.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) James, <em>Washington Square</em> xAlcott, <em>Little Women</em>; Giants
through G74; jackets: 347. (Fall) Alcott, <em>Little Women</em> xCicero, <em>Basic
Works</em>; Giants through G75 with G57 Brooks, <em>Flowering of New England</em>;
jackets: 348.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Gordon S. Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot’s
<em>Middlemarch</em> for ML College Editions and offered to write an
introduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six
months later: “You will find all the contemporary English critics like
Leavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf’s
opinion about <em>Middlemarch</em> as the great novel of the 19th Century. It
is back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will
be a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and
World’s Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by
the time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who
have anticipated the change in critical estimate” (Haight to Stein, 15
June 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML’s new paperback series, Modern
Library College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published
at the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, “There are some
titles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far
are assured top sellers, while <em>Middlemarch</em>, although rated high
critically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as,
say, <em>Anna Karenina</em>. . . . The status of <em>Middlemarch</em> on our list here
is simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at
least break even on <em>Middlemarch</em> we will include it” (Stein to Haight,
20 June 1950). <em>Middlemarch</em> (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984.</p>
<p>Jess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph
Conrad’s <em>Nostromo</em> and <em>The Nigger of the Narcissus</em>, Theodore
Dreiser’s <em>An American Tragedy</em>, George Eliot’s <em>Adam Bede</em>, Oliver
Goldsmith’s <em>Vicar of Wakefield</em>, three works by Henry James (<em>Daisy
Miller</em>, <em>The American</em>, and <em>The Golden Bowl</em>), Franz Kafka’s <em>The
Castle</em>, Jack London’s <em>Call of the Wild</em>, Lucretius’s <em>On the Nature of
Things</em>, Frank Norris’s <em>The Pit</em>, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s <em>Quo Vadis</em>,
Ignazio Silone’s <em>Bread and Wine</em>, Edmund Spenser’s <em>Faerie Queen</em>,
Henri Stendhal’s <em>Charterhouse of Parma</em>, Mark Twain’s <em>Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn</em>, Edith Wharton’s <em>Ethan Frome</em>, Owen Wister’s <em>The
Virginian</em>, and Emile Zola’s <em>Germinal</em> (Stein to Cerf, 10 October
1950). The following titles on Stein’s list were published in the
regular series or ML Giants: Conrad, <em>Nostromo</em> (1951: 438); Dreiser,
<em>An American Tragedy</em> (1950: G89); Goldsmith, <em>Vicar of Wakefield and
Other Writings</em> (1955: 476); Kafka, <em>The Castle</em> (1969: 610); and
Spenser, <em>Selected Poetry</em> (1964: G104). Twain’s <em>Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn</em> was available as part of a ML Giant that included
<em>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as
a volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein’s list were former
ML titles that had been discontinued: James, <em>Daisy Miller; An
International Episode</em> (1918: 60) and Stendhal, <em>Charterhouse of Parma</em>
(1937: 298).</p>
<p>Somerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James’s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology">Principles
of
Psychology</a>y</em>
(Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume
of Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to
Stein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been
enthusiastic about the proposal.</p>

new series, and <em>Flowering Judas</em> was restored to the ML in spring 1953.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Freud’s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious
can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in
the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory,
represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through
them inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to
interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche has
opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in
the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the
world of dreams, Sigmund Freud has created a transformation in our
generation’s thinking. <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> is here offered,
complete and unabridged, in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who
for almost forty years had been the translator and standard-bearer of
Freudian theories in America. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brill translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co.,
1913. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published spring 1950. <em>WR</em> 25 March 1950. First printing: 10,000
copies.</p>
<p>The text follows that of <em>The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud</em> (1938:
G37), where most of the first chapter of <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>
is omitted. The Giant includes the following Editor’s Note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the first chapter of this work is nothing but an introduction to
the book proper, it was deemed best for the purposes of this
collection of Freud’s basic writings to omit most of it and to give
only those parts that are in any way pertinent to the themes under
later consideration. For it is of no particular interest or value to
the general reader to know everything held by the ancients and moderns
concerning the phenomena of dreams, up to the appearance of the first
German edition of this work in 1900. (p. 185)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Editor’s Note is followed by three paragraphs headed, “<em>The author
summarizes these views as follows.</em>” The regular ML edition omits both
the Editor’s Note and this heading. The three summary paragraphs of the
regular ML edition begin in the middle of p. 5 with no indication that
anything has been omitted. In most editions of <em>The Interpretation of
Dreams</em> the first chapter occupies about 95 pages. In the regular ML
text it occupies five pages.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Issued on the one hundredth anniversary of William Wordsworth’s death,
this volume is both commemorative and representative. It bears
testimony to the continuing vitality of one of the greatest of
England’s imaginative, romantic poets. In its more than 700 pages are
to be found all that the modern reader can demand. Here included are
the “Descriptive Sketches,” “Lyrical Ballads,” tales, sonnets, odes,
pastorals, “The Prelude,” “Ecclesiastical Sonnets” and a wide
selection of long and short miscellaneous verse. Mark Van Doren, poet,
essayist and teacher, has made a generous yet discriminating selection
from the vast body of writing achieved by Wordsworth during the almost
fifty years he devoted to poetry. Mr. Van Doren’s Introduction is an
illuminating critical interpretation of the poet and his work.

<p>The two-page “Bibliography of Wordsworth” consisting of Works by
Wordsworth and Criticism and Bibliography originally appeared in MLCE
(1950) and in the regular ML in 1951. Stein decided before the first
printing of the regular ML edition appeared that he wanted to include
Wordsworth’s <em>Selected Poetry</em> in MLCE. He offered Van Doren an
additional $50 to prepare a bibliography, which was a standard feature
of the College Editions (Stein to Van Doren, 23 February 1950). The
second printing of the regular ML edition used the MLCE text and appears
to have been published by the end of 1951. The earliest printing
examined dates from spring 1954.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Since 1881, when it was first published, <em>Washington Square</em> has had
three incarnations. In its original form, it was the novel by which
Henry James won world-wide recognition in his early maturity. As a
play, under the title <em>The Heiress</em>, its glowing story held thousands
of theatre-goers under its spell. Finally, as a motion picture, under
its new title, the novel once again gave evidence of its vitality and
popularity to a new mass audience. Now <em>Washington Square</em> takes an
honored place in the Modern Library with three other famous works by
Henry James: <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>, No. 169, <em>The Wings of the
Dove</em>, No. 244, and <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, No. 107. Clifton Fadiman
contributes an illuminating and perceptive Introduction for this
distinguished addition to the series. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In his revealing introduction written specially for this edition, W.
Somerset Maugham expresses his own preference among all the novels in
his long and distinguished career. He says: “I am willing enough to
agree with common opinion that <em>Of Human Bondage</em> is my best work. It
is the kind of book that an author can only write once. After all, he
has only one life. But the book I like best is <em>Cakes and Ale</em>.” The
same distinction has been made by countless enthusiastic readers. They
consider <em>Of Human Bondage</em> Maugham’s masterpiece. But the novel they
take to their hearts for its candor and warmth and humor is <em>Cakes and
Ale</em>.</p>
<p>The third Maugham novel in the Modern Library (<em>Of Human Bondage</em>, No.
176, and <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em>, No. 27, are the other two), is
introduced into the series with the author’s own version of the
controversies and conjectures aroused by this withering but
affectionate satire. (<em>Spring 1950</em>)</p>

wider black panel at right; “L” of title in black on yellow panel with

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In the judgment of the foremost literary men of the world, William
Faulkner stands pre-eminent among living American novelists. These
critics may differ in their preference of any one of his fifteen
novels over any other, but all are in agreement that <em>Light in August</em>
is one of the finest among his major works. For its vitality, its
scope, its imagination and, above all, its compassion, it is more than
a novelist’s achievement; it is an experience in which the reader
becomes a deeply involved participant. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except in brilliant yellow (83) and black only.
Yellowish gray shading omitted from title, “By” in black instead of
yellowish gray, “INTRODUCTION BY” in reverse instead of yellowish gray;
other lettering on black panel as jacket A. Front flap reset with the
following revisions in the second sentence: “fifteen” omitted, “finest”
changed to “most distinguished”. (<em>Fall 1955; Fall 1962</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1932. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950.
<em>WR</em> 30 September 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies.</p>
<p>Random House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith
and Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML was <em>Sanctuary</em>
(233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of
Faulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles
were added until 1946, when <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em>
(394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. The publication of that volume, together with <em>The Portable
Faulkner</em>, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few
months earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a
major American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature
in 1949. The Modern Library edition of <em>Light in August</em>, published four
years after <em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em>, became the third
Faulkner volume in the series.</p>
<p>The ML reset <em>Light in August</em> because Smith and Haas had not made
plates. All four Smith and Haas printings had been from standing type
which had since been melted. The only previous reprint edition of <em>Light
in August</em>, published by New Directions in its Modern Readers series in
1947, was photographically reproduced from the Smith and Haas edition
and printed by offset lithography.</p>
<p>In addition to the first printing of 7,500 copies, printings of 429.1a
were as follows: 5,000 copies (1951), 5,000 copies (1952), 5,000 copies
(1953), 5,000 copies (1954), two printings of 5,000 copies each (1955),
5,000 copies (1956), three printings of 5,000 copies each (1957), four
printings of 5,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 10,000 copies (1959), 10,000
copies (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each
(1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of
binding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing
(there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the
period 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
First published in October, 1932, <em>Light in August</em> was the seventh of
Faulkner’s novels to appear. Unquestionably one of his masterworks, it
has always stood near or at the top of any critic’s attempted listing
of the author’s works in the order of their excellence or importance;
and it will continue to be one of the most widely read, studied, and
written about novels of this century. (<em>Spring 1963</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from ML
printings of <em>Sanctuary</em> and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> was dated 14 November
1962 (RHC box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to
Faulkner’s <em>Light in August</em> was also dropped around this time.
Introductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML
began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper.
The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for <em>Light in
August</em> in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner
titles in white uniform jackets. Four, including <em>Light in August</em>, were
existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four
titles—<em>Selected Short Stories</em>, <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, <em>A Fable</em>, and
<em>Pylon</em> —were new to the ML. Two, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay
Dying</em>, had previously been combined in a single ML volume.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The enormous influence of Samuel Richardson on the English novel has
persisted for more than two centuries. His analysis of sentiment, his
rich imaginative power, his insight into character, particularly
feminine character, and his infinitely patient observation of the
behavior and relationships of the people in his created world—these
are the elements for which he is regarded as the <em>first</em> of our
novelists. The overwhelming length of his masterpiece, *Clarissa—*over
2,000 pages in its unabridged form—has frightened away all too many
readers. Under the skillful and perceptive editorship of John Angus
Burrell of Columbia University, the substance and spirit of this great
novel are retained and its prolixities and excesses are trimmed away
to make a volume of over 800 lively pages. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Fujita pictorial jacket on coated white paper with inset
illustration in vivid purplish red (254) and black of a woman wearing a
bonnet tied below her chin, with “Modern Library Book” in reverse and
Fujita “ml” symbol in black at foot of illustration; “Clarissa” in deep
purplish red (256) and other lettering in black above inset
illustration. Front flap as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1967 format</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML abridgment. Published fall 1950. <em>WR</em> 9 December 1950. First
printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Burrell received a flat fee of $1,000 for his editorial work and
introduction. Cerf asked for a book of no more than 600 pages with the
manuscript to be delivered by 1 February 1950. He told Burrell: “This
provision of size should mean that our condensation will be somewhat
longer—and I know it will be better—than any other condensation now in
existence” (Cerf to Burrell, 4 November 1949). The published volume
exceeded the anticipated length by 200 pages.</p>
<p>Random House announced the forthcoming ML edition as <em>Clarissa Harlowe</em>.
Burrell wrote to emphasize that the correct title was <em>Clarissa, or, The
History of a Young Lady</em> (Burrell to Cerf and Commins, 23 February
1950). Commins wanted to use <em>Clarissa Harlowe</em> on the jacket. He argued
that <em>Clarissa</em> was not enough to identify the book, that the full title
was too long, and that everyone knew it by the incorrect title (Commins,
undated memo to Klopfer). In the end the full title <em>Clarissa or The
History of a Young Lady</em> was used on the title page but the running
heads record the title as THE HISTORY OF [verso pages] CLARISSA HARLOW
[recto pages]. The front panel of jacket A reads <em>Clarissa</em> | THE
HISTORY OF | CLARISSA HARLOWE, THE FIRST AND | ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS |
HEROINES OF THE ENGLISH NOVEL.</p>
<p>The front panel of jacket B records the title as Clarissa | or The
History of a Young Lady.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Louisa May Alcott’s hope that <em>Little Women</em> would become “the most
tattered, dog-eared, best-loved book in the library” has been more
than fulfilled through the decades following its publication in 1868.
Generation after generation, young people and their elders have read
and reread the adventures of the March family, admired Jo’s daring,
wept when Beth died and sighed sympathetically over Meg’s and Amy’s
romantic adventures. Those who remember their youth and want to renew
it keep a special place in their hearts for this nostalgic tale of a
vanished time and spirit in American life. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published
fall 1950. <em>WR</em> 30 September 1950. First printing: 6,000 copies.
Discontinued fall 1955.</p>
<p><em>Little Women</em> with illustrations by Albert de Mee Jousset was
originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library
in fall 1947. Jousset received $2,000 for the artwork, which included
color illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings
ranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on
pages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly
before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the
Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both
<em>Little Women</em> and Parkman’s <em>Oregon Trail</em>, the other Illustrated
Modern Library title announced for fall 1947.</p>
<p>At this point the type for <em>Little Women</em> was in galleys (the text was
set from the edition published in Grosset &amp; Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior
Library), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed,
and all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two
years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish <em>Little Women</em>
in the regular ML without color illustrations. <em>The Oregon Trail</em> (423)
was also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket
of <em>Little Women</em> is unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color
illustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library.</p>
<p>The ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second
printing in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The point of controversy, in 1864, between Charles Kingsley and John
Henry Newman is now only incidental to what it produced. Out of it
came one of the most influential religious autobiographies of Western
literature, the <em>Apologia Pro Vita Sua</em>. It is far more than a
vigorous defense of religious adherence; it is an affirmation of faith
and conviction, a projection of a magnetic and powerful personality
and a dynamic account of spiritual conversion. Anton C. Pegis, the
renowned Thomist scholar and distinguished Catholic philosopher,
provides an illuminating and perceptive introduction for Cardinal
Newman’s masterpiece. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>

<p>Cerf initially asked Jacques Maritain, whom Commins had suggested as a
long shot, to write an introduction to <em>Apologia Pro Vita Sua</em> (Cerf to
Maritain, 16 September 1949). Maritain either declined or did not reply.
Cerf then turned to Pegis, who had worked with Random House and the ML
in the past. At Commins’s request Pegis secured a nihil obstat and
imprimatur on his introduction. Commins sent Pegis a copy of the
original 1864 edition to mark for composition purposes (Commins to
Pegis, 10 April 1950). Pegis initially hoped to include Newman’s
corrections from the 1865 edition but decided to use the original text
accompanied by the correspondence with Charles Kingsley (pp. 373–90) and
Kingsley’s pamphlet, <em>What, Then, Does Dr. Newman Mean?</em> (pp. 391–430).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Fifty years have passed since <em>Kim</em> enchanted the world with its
insight into Indian life. Since then there have been countless books
which described and interpreted that teeming land, but none has
supplanted Rudyard Kipling’s radiant picture, with its people of high
and low caste, in the hearts of readers, old and young. As a tale of
picaresque adventure, as a pageant and as a social document, <em>Kim</em> is
a classic in its own field. It is storytelling at its best, with all
the vitality and color and appeal it first offered at the turn of the
century. (<em>Fall 1950</em>)</p>

<p>Cerf first tried to include <em>Kim</em> in the ML in 1931, perhaps as a
replacement for Kipling’s <em>Three Soldiers</em> (3) which had been
discontinued several weeks earlier, but Doubleday, Doran was not ready
to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17 February 1931). He
asked again the following year (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December
1932) with the same result. At that point he appears to have given up.
The idea of including a book by Kipling resurfaced in 1949; a week later
he decided it should be <em>Kim</em> (Cerf to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 9
November 1949 and 15 November 1949). This time Doubleday was willing to
grant reprint rights.</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Since its publication in 1901, <em>Kim</em> has enchanted readers young and
old with its insight into Indian life. As a tale of picaresque
adventure, as a pageant and as a social document, <em>Kim</em> is a classic
in its field. It is storytelling at its best, with all the vitality
and color and appeal it first offered at the turn of the century.</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1950\n\n## 1950\n\n### General\n\nIn 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library\nCollege Editions. All of the early titles were taken from the regular\nModern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold\ninitially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular\nModern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they\nwere issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward\nthe academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a\ndistinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new\nseries had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath\nBrooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson,\nRoyal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray,\nMark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and\nMorton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in\nregular Modern Library printings as well.\n\nMany of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken\nover the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often\nthan not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met.\nIn contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College\nEditions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They\nwere, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was\nbeginning to eat into the Modern Library’s college market with their\nregular Modern Library series.\n\nThat series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart & Co. in late\n1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics\naimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to\nseventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound\nvolumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were\nwell-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics.\n\nThe Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess\nStein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions\nfrom the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore\norders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and\nIllinois.\n\nThe Random House juvenile department, already well established with such\nauthors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to\nthe firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched\nin 1950.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nNine new titles were added and four discontinued in the regular ML\nseries, bringing the total titles to 276. There were an additional 74\ntitles in the Giants. The Modern Library College Editions launched with\n41 titles of non-royalty-bearing works.\n\n### Title page\n\nModern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer.\n\n### Binding\n\nThe binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a\ncontrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Each printing of a\ngiven title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset\npanels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was\nstamped in gold.\n\n### Price\n\n$1.25.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) James, *Washington Square* xAlcott, *Little Women*; Giants\nthrough G74; jackets: 347. (Fall) Alcott, *Little Women* xCicero, *Basic\nWorks*; Giants through G75 with G57 Brooks, *Flowering of New England*;\njackets: 348.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nGordon S. Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot’s\n*Middlemarch* for ML College Editions and offered to write an\nintroduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six\nmonths later: “You will find all the contemporary English critics like\nLeavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf’s\nopinion about *Middlemarch* as the great novel of the 19th Century. It\nis back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will\nbe a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and\nWorld’s Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by\nthe time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who\nhave anticipated the change in critical estimate” (Haight to Stein, 15\nJune 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML’s new paperback series, Modern\nLibrary College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published\nat the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, “There are some\ntitles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far\nare assured top sellers, while *Middlemarch*, although rated high\ncritically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as,\nsay, *Anna Karenina*. . . . The status of *Middlemarch* on our list here\nis simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at\nleast break even on *Middlemarch* we will include it” (Stein to Haight,\n20 June 1950). *Middlemarch* (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984.\n\nJess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph\nConrad’s *Nostromo* and *The Nigger of the Narcissus*, Theodore\nDreiser’s *An American Tragedy*, George Eliot’s *Adam Bede*, Oliver\nGoldsmith’s *Vicar of Wakefield*, three works by Henry James (*Daisy\nMiller*, *The American*, and *The Golden Bowl*), Franz Kafka’s *The\nCastle*, Jack London’s *Call of the Wild*, Lucretius’s *On the Nature of\nThings*, Frank Norris’s *The Pit*, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s *Quo Vadis*,\nIgnazio Silone’s *Bread and Wine*, Edmund Spenser’s *Faerie Queen*,\nHenri Stendhal’s *Charterhouse of Parma*, Mark Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn*, Edith Wharton’s *Ethan Frome*, Owen Wister’s *The\nVirginian*, and Emile Zola’s *Germinal* (Stein to Cerf, 10 October\n1950). The following titles on Stein’s list were published in the\nregular series or ML Giants: Conrad, *Nostromo* (1951: 438); Dreiser,\n*An American Tragedy* (1950: G89); Goldsmith, *Vicar of Wakefield and\nOther Writings* (1955: 476); Kafka, *The Castle* (1969: 610); and\nSpenser, *Selected Poetry* (1964: G104). Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn* was available as part of a ML Giant that included\n*Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as\na volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein’s list were former\nML titles that had been discontinued: James, *Daisy Miller; An\nInternational Episode* (1918: 60) and Stendhal, *Charterhouse of Parma*\n(1937: 298).\n\nSomerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James’s *[Principles\nof\nPsychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology)y*\n(Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume\nof Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to\nStein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been\nenthusiastic about the proposal.\n\n### New titles\n\nFreud, *Interpretation of Dreams* (1950) 425\n\nWordsworth, *Selected Poetry* (1950) 426\n\nJames, *Washington Square* (1950) 427\n\nMaugham, *Cakes and Ale* (1950) 428\n\nFaulkner, *Light in August* (1950) 429\n\nRichardson, *Clarissa* (1950) 430\n\nAlcott, *Little Women* (1950) 431\n\nNewman, *Apologia pro Vita Sua* (1950) 432\n\nKipling, *Kim* (1950) 433### Discontinued\n\nHémon, *Maria* *Chapdelaine* (1934)\n\nPearson, *Studies in Murder* (1938)\n\nPorter, *Flowering Judas* (1940)\\*\n\nTomlinson, *Sea and the Jungle* (1928)\n\n\\**Flowering Judas* was withdrawn from the ML by Harcourt, Brace & Co.\nso it could be added to their own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace\nModern Classics, launched in 1948.

(*Fall 1950*)\n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A except in brilliant yellow (83) and black only.\nYellowish gray shading omitted from title, “By” in black instead of\nyellowish gray, “INTRODUCTION BY” in reverse instead of yellowish gray;\nother lettering on black panel as jacket A. Front flap reset with the\nfollowing revisions in the second sentence: “fifteen” omitted, “finest”\nchanged to “most distinguished”. (*Fall 1955; Fall 1962*)\n\nOriginally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1932. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950.\n*WR* 30 September 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies.\n\nRandom House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith\nand Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML was *Sanctuary*\n(233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of\nFaulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles\nwere added until 1946, when *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*\n(394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. The publication of that volume, together with *The Portable\nFaulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few\nmonths earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a\nmajor American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature\nin 1949. The Modern Library edition of *Light in August*, published four\nyears after *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*, became the third\nFaulkner volume in the series.\n\nThe ML reset *Light in August* because Smith and Haas had not made\nplates. All four Smith and Haas printings had been from standing type\nwhich had since been melted. The only previous reprint edition of *Light\nin August*, published by New Directions in its Modern Readers series in\n1947, was photographically reproduced from the Smith and Haas edition\nand printed by offset lithography.\n\nIn addition to the first printing of 7,500 copies, printings of 429.1a\nwere as follows: 5,000 copies (1951), 5,000 copies (1952), 5,000 copies\n(1953), 5,000 copies (1954), two printings of 5,000 copies each (1955),\n5,000 copies (1956), three printings of 5,000 copies each (1957), four\nprintings of 5,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 10,000 copies (1959), 10,000\ncopies (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each\n(1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of\nbinding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing\n(there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the\nperiod 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so.\n\n#### 429.1b.

The introduction to\nFaulkner’s *Light in August* was also dropped around this time.\nIntroductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML\nbegan to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper.\nThe earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in\nAugust* in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner\ntitles in white uniform jackets. Four, including *Light in August*, were\nexisting ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four\ntitles—*Selected Short Stories*, *Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and\n*Pylon* —were new to the ML.

The overwhelming length of his masterpiece, *Clarissa—*over\n> 2,000 pages in its unabridged form—has frightened away all too many\n> readers. Under the skillful and perceptive editorship of John Angus\n> Burrell of Columbia University, the substance and spirit of this great\n> novel are retained and its prolixities and excesses are trimmed away\n> to make a volume of over 800 lively pages.

Cerf asked for a book of no more than 600 pages with the\nmanuscript to be delivered by 1 February 1950. He told Burrell: “This\nprovision of size should mean that our condensation will be somewhat\nlonger—and I know it will be better—than any other condensation now in\nexistence” (Cerf to Burrell, 4 November 1949). The published volume\nexceeded the anticipated length by 200 pages.\n\nRandom House announced the forthcoming ML edition as *Clarissa Harlowe*.\nBurrell wrote to emphasize that the correct title was *Clarissa, or, The\nHistory of a Young Lady* (Burrell to Cerf and Commins, 23 February\n1950). Commins wanted to use *Clarissa Harlowe* on the jacket. He argued\nthat *Clarissa* was not enough to identify the book, that the full title\nwas too long, and that everyone knew it by the incorrect title (Commins,\nundated memo to Klopfer). In the end the full title *Clarissa or The\nHistory of a Young Lady* was used on the title page but the running\nheads record the title as THE HISTORY OF \\[verso pages\\] CLARISSA HARLOW\n\\[recto pages\\]. The front panel of jacket A reads *Clarissa* | THE\nHISTORY OF | CLARISSA HARLOWE, THE FIRST AND | ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS |\nHEROINES OF THE ENGLISH NOVEL.\n\nThe front panel of jacket B records the title as Clarissa | or The\nHistory of a Young Lady.\n\n### 431\n\n**LOUISA MAY ALCOTT.

First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1955.\n\n*Little Women* with illustrations by Albert de Mee Jousset was\noriginally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library\nin fall 1947. Jousset received $2,000 for the artwork, which included\ncolor illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings\nranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on\npages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly\nbefore escalating production costs forced the suspension of the\nIllustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both\n*Little Women* and Parkman’s *Oregon Trail*, the other Illustrated\nModern Library title announced for fall 1947.\n\nAt this point the type for *Little Women* was in galleys (the text was\nset from the edition published in Grosset & Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior\nLibrary), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed,\nand all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two\nyears until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *Little Women*\nin the regular ML without color illustrations. *The Oregon Trail* (423)\nwas also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket\nof *Little Women* is unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color\nillustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library.\n\nThe ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second\nprinting in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued.\n\n### 432\n\n**JOHN HENRY NEWMAN. APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA. 1950–1970. (ML 113)**\n\n#### 432.

Maritain either declined or did not reply.\nCerf then turned to Pegis, who had worked with Random House and the ML\nin the past. At Commins’s request Pegis secured a nihil obstat and\nimprimatur on his introduction. Commins sent Pegis a copy of the\noriginal 1864 edition to mark for composition purposes (Commins to\nPegis, 10 April 1950). Pegis initially hoped to include Newman’s\ncorrections from the 1865 edition but decided to use the original text\naccompanied by the correspondence with Charles Kingsley (pp. 373–90) and\nKingsley’s pamphlet, *What, Then, Does Dr. Newman Mean?* (pp. 391–430).\n\n### 433\n\n**RUDYARD KIPLING.

  "general": "In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library\nCollege Editions. All of the early titles were taken from the regular\nModern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold\ninitially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular\nModern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they\nwere issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward\nthe academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a\ndistinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new\nseries had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath\nBrooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson,\nRoyal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray,\nMark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and\nMorton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in\nregular Modern Library printings as well.\n\nMany of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken\nover the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often\nthan not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met.\nIn contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College\nEditions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They\nwere, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was\nbeginning to eat into the Modern Library’s college market with their\nregular Modern Library series.\n\nThat series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart & Co. in late\n1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics\naimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to\nseventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound\nvolumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were\nwell-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics.\n\nThe Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess\nStein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions\nfrom the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore\norders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and\nIllinois.\n\nThe Random House juvenile department, already well established with such\nauthors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to\nthe firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched\nin 1950.",
  "numberOfTitles": "Nine new titles were added and four discontinued in the regular ML\nseries, bringing the total titles to 276. There were an additional 74\ntitles in the Giants. The Modern Library College Editions launched with\n41 titles of non-royalty-bearing works.",
  "titlePage": "Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer.",
  "binding": "The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a\ncontrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Each printing of a\ngiven title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset\npanels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was\nstamped in gold.",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Gordon S. Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot’s\n*Middlemarch* for ML College Editions and offered to write an\nintroduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six\nmonths later: “You will find all the contemporary English critics like\nLeavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf’s\nopinion about *Middlemarch* as the great novel of the 19th Century. It\nis back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will\nbe a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and\nWorld’s Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by\nthe time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who\nhave anticipated the change in critical estimate” (Haight to Stein, 15\nJune 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML’s new paperback series, Modern\nLibrary College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published\nat the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, “There are some\ntitles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far\nare assured top sellers, while *Middlemarch*, although rated high\ncritically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as,\nsay, *Anna Karenina*. . . . The status of *Middlemarch* on our list here\nis simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at\nleast break even on *Middlemarch* we will include it” (Stein to Haight,\n20 June 1950). *Middlemarch* (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984.\n\nJess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph\nConrad’s *Nostromo* and *The Nigger of the Narcissus*, Theodore\nDreiser’s *An American Tragedy*, George Eliot’s *Adam Bede*, Oliver\nGoldsmith’s *Vicar of Wakefield*, three works by Henry James (*Daisy\nMiller*, *The American*, and *The Golden Bowl*), Franz Kafka’s *The\nCastle*, Jack London’s *Call of the Wild*, Lucretius’s *On the Nature of\nThings*, Frank Norris’s *The Pit*, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s *Quo Vadis*,\nIgnazio Silone’s *Bread and Wine*, Edmund Spenser’s *Faerie Queen*,\nHenri Stendhal’s *Charterhouse of Parma*, Mark Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn*, Edith Wharton’s *Ethan Frome*, Owen Wister’s *The\nVirginian*, and Emile Zola’s *Germinal* (Stein to Cerf, 10 October\n1950). The following titles on Stein’s list were published in the\nregular series or ML Giants: Conrad, *Nostromo* (1951: 438); Dreiser,\n*An American Tragedy* (1950: G89); Goldsmith, *Vicar of Wakefield and\nOther Writings* (1955: 476); Kafka, *The Castle* (1969: 610); and\nSpenser, *Selected Poetry* (1964: G104). Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn* was available as part of a ML Giant that included\n*Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as\na volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein’s list were former\nML titles that had been discontinued: James, *Daisy Miller; An\nInternational Episode* (1918: 60) and Stendhal, *Charterhouse of Parma*\n(1937: 298).\n\nSomerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James’s *[Principles\nof\nPsychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology)y*\n(Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume\nof Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to\nStein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been\nenthusiastic about the proposal.",

First printing: 7,500 copies.\n\nRandom House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith\nand Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML was *Sanctuary*\n(233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of\nFaulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles\nwere added until 1946, when *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*\n(394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. The publication of that volume, together with *The Portable\nFaulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few\nmonths earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a\nmajor American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature\nin 1949. The Modern Library edition of *Light in August*, published four\nyears after *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*, became the third\nFaulkner volume in the series.\n\nThe ML reset *Light in August* because Smith and Haas had not made\nplates. All four Smith and Haas printings had been from standing type\nwhich had since been melted. The only previous reprint edition of *Light\nin August*, published by New Directions in its Modern Readers series in\n1947, was photographically reproduced from the Smith and Haas edition\nand printed by offset lithography.\n\nIn addition to the first printing of 7,500 copies, printings of 429.1a\nwere as follows: 5,000 copies (1951), 5,000 copies (1952), 5,000 copies\n(1953), 5,000 copies (1954), two printings of 5,000 copies each (1955),\n5,000 copies (1956), three printings of 5,000 copies each (1957), four\nprintings of 5,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 10,000 copies (1959), 10,000\ncopies (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each\n(1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of\nbinding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing\n(there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the\nperiod 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so.\n\n#### 429.1b.

The overwhelming length of his masterpiece, *Clarissa—*over\n> 2,000 pages in its unabridged form—has frightened away all too many\n> readers. Under the skillful and perceptive editorship of John Angus\n> Burrell of Columbia University, the substance and spirit of this great\n> novel are retained and its prolixities and excesses are trimmed away\n> to make a volume of over 800 lively pages.

Cerf asked for a book of no more than 600 pages with the\nmanuscript to be delivered by 1 February 1950. He told Burrell: “This\nprovision of size should mean that our condensation will be somewhat\nlonger—and I know it will be better—than any other condensation now in\nexistence” (Cerf to Burrell, 4 November 1949). The published volume\nexceeded the anticipated length by 200 pages.\n\nRandom House announced the forthcoming ML edition as *Clarissa Harlowe*.\nBurrell wrote to emphasize that the correct title was *Clarissa, or, The\nHistory of a Young Lady* (Burrell to Cerf and Commins, 23 February\n1950). Commins wanted to use *Clarissa Harlowe* on the jacket. He argued\nthat *Clarissa* was not enough to identify the book, that the full title\nwas too long, and that everyone knew it by the incorrect title (Commins,\nundated memo to Klopfer). In the end the full title *Clarissa or The\nHistory of a Young Lady* was used on the title page but the running\nheads record the title as THE HISTORY OF \\[verso pages\\] CLARISSA HARLOW\n\\[recto pages\\]. The front panel of jacket A reads *Clarissa* | THE\nHISTORY OF | CLARISSA HARLOWE, THE FIRST AND | ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS |\nHEROINES OF THE ENGLISH NOVEL.\n\nThe front panel of jacket B records the title as Clarissa | or The\nHistory of a Young Lady."

The line drawings\nranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on\npages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly\nbefore escalating production costs forced the suspension of the\nIllustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both\n*Little Women* and Parkman’s *Oregon Trail*, the other Illustrated\nModern Library title announced for fall 1947.\n\nAt this point the type for *Little Women* was in galleys (the text was\nset from the edition published in Grosset & Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior\nLibrary), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed,\nand all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two\nyears until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *Little Women*\nin the regular ML without color illustrations. *The Oregon Trail* (423)\nwas also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket\nof *Little Women* is unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color\nillustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library.\n\nThe ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1950 1950 In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library\nCollege Editions. All of the early titles were taken from the regular\nModern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold\ninitially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular\nModern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they\nwere issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward\nthe academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a\ndistinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new\nseries had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath\nBrooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson,\nRoyal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray,\nMark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and\nMorton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in\nregular Modern Library printings as well.\n\nMany of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken\nover the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often\nthan not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met.\nIn contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College\nEditions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They\nwere, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was\nbeginning to eat into the Modern Library’s college market with their\nregular Modern Library series.\n\nThat series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart & Co. in late\n1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics\naimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to\nseventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound\nvolumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were\nwell-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics.\n\nThe Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess\nStein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions\nfrom the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore\norders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and\nIllinois.\n\nThe Random House juvenile department, already well established with such\nauthors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to\nthe firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched\nin 1950. Nine new titles were added and four discontinued in the regular ML\nseries, bringing the total titles to 276. There were an additional 74\ntitles in the Giants. The Modern Library College Editions launched with\n41 titles of non-royalty-bearing works. Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph\nBlumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created\nthe title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making\nelectrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth\nlinen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray\ncloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a\ncontrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Each printing of a\ngiven title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset\npanels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s\ntorchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the\nspine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the\ncolored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was\nstamped in gold. $1.25. (Spring) James, *Washington Square* xAlcott, *Little Women*; Giants\nthrough G74; jackets: 347. (Fall) Alcott, *Little Women* xCicero, *Basic\nWorks*; Giants through G75 with G57 Brooks, *Flowering of New England*;\njackets: 348. Gordon S. Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot’s\n*Middlemarch* for ML College Editions and offered to write an\nintroduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six\nmonths later: “You will find all the contemporary English critics like\nLeavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf’s\nopinion about *Middlemarch* as the great novel of the 19th Century. It\nis back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will\nbe a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and\nWorld’s Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by\nthe time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who\nhave anticipated the change in critical estimate” (Haight to Stein, 15\nJune 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML’s new paperback series, Modern\nLibrary College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published\nat the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, “There are some\ntitles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far\nare assured top sellers, while *Middlemarch*, although rated high\ncritically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as,\nsay, *Anna Karenina*. . . . The status of *Middlemarch* on our list here\nis simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at\nleast break even on *Middlemarch* we will include it” (Stein to Haight,\n20 June 1950). *Middlemarch* (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984.\n\nJess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph\nConrad’s *Nostromo* and *The Nigger of the Narcissus*, Theodore\nDreiser’s *An American Tragedy*, George Eliot’s *Adam Bede*, Oliver\nGoldsmith’s *Vicar of Wakefield*, three works by Henry James (*Daisy\nMiller*, *The American*, and *The Golden Bowl*), Franz Kafka’s *The\nCastle*, Jack London’s *Call of the Wild*, Lucretius’s *On the Nature of\nThings*, Frank Norris’s *The Pit*, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s *Quo Vadis*,\nIgnazio Silone’s *Bread and Wine*, Edmund Spenser’s *Faerie Queen*,\nHenri Stendhal’s *Charterhouse of Parma*, Mark Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn*, Edith Wharton’s *Ethan Frome*, Owen Wister’s *The\nVirginian*, and Emile Zola’s *Germinal* (Stein to Cerf, 10 October\n1950). The following titles on Stein’s list were published in the\nregular series or ML Giants: Conrad, *Nostromo* (1951: 438); Dreiser,\n*An American Tragedy* (1950: G89); Goldsmith, *Vicar of Wakefield and\nOther Writings* (1955: 476); Kafka, *The Castle* (1969: 610); and\nSpenser, *Selected Poetry* (1964: G104). Twain’s *Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn* was available as part of a ML Giant that included\n*Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as\na volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein’s list were former\nML titles that had been discontinued: James, *Daisy Miller; An\nInternational Episode* (1918: 60) and Stendhal, *Charterhouse of Parma*\n(1937: 298).\n\nSomerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James’s *[Principles\nof\nPsychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology)y*\n(Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume\nof Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to\nStein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been\nenthusiastic about the proposal. Freud, *Interpretation of Dreams* (1950) 425\n\nWordsworth, *Selected Poetry* (1950) 426\n\nJames, *Washington Square* (1950) 427\n\nMaugham, *Cakes and Ale* (1950) 428\n\nFaulkner, *Light in August* (1950) 429\n\nRichardson, *Clarissa* (1950) 430\n\nAlcott, *Little Women* (1950) 431\n\nNewman, *Apologia pro Vita Sua* (1950) 432\n\nKipling, *Kim* (1950) 433 In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library\nCollege Editions.
