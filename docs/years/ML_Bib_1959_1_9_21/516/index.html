Chances are that you will be in on a conversation, one so fresh and immediate that you will seem to be hearing, not reading it. You have entered the world of J. D. Salinger, and you will continue reading until you have finished all nine stories. Who are these extraordinary people, these grave and knowing children, what is happening to them, what are they revealing about past events, about themselves, about their dealings with each other and the world? The author does not tell you directly but you find out for yourself from their every word, gesture, and act."

In 1963 Salinger asked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the entry forThe Catcher in the Rye(1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the president of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal notice that termination of theNine Storiescontract would become effective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand."

Perhaps there was a lingering hope that Salinger might change his mind.Catcher in the RyeandNine Storieswere listed inPublishers’ Trade List Annualthrough 1965 and continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through 1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new titles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number ofNine Stories, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 whenRenaissance Philosophy, vol. 2: The Transalpine Thinkers(1969: 611) was published as ML 301."
