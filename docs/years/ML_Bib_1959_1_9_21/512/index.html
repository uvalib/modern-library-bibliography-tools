Jacket:Pictorial in deep purplish red (256), strong bluish green (160), light bluish green (163) and black on coated white paper with lettering in black and deep purplish red; illustration at foot of wire hangers with hooks overlapping deep purplish red bar and garments in strong bluish green and light bluish green, all against white background. Front flap: Few modern writers share the remarkable talent of Jerome Weidman—a talent for telling a story with brightly-lit realism, for depicting characters with extraordinary sharpness and insight, and for inciting the reader to agree or disagree (vehemently in either case) with his viewpoint. Among the best of Weidman’s novels isI Can Get It For You Wholesale, the story of Harry Bogen, who climbs ruthlessly to power and wealth without concern for those he uses or hurts. This novel, commended by theNew York Timesas “racy, fresh and continuously interesting,” is one that all readers will want to know and that none will ever forget. (Spring 1959) Originally published by Simon and Schuster, 1937. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1959.WR23 February 1959. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. The ML paid royalties of 8 cents a copy. Bernice Baumgarten, Weidman’s agent, suggestedI Can Get It for You Wholesalefor the ML in 1954. Cerf replied that the idea worth serious consideration (Cerf to Baumgarten, 9 November 1954). Weidman’s novel was added to the ML four years and several months later."
