Front flap: One evening, in the year 1546, Giorgio Vasari, a Florentine painter and architect, was dining in Rome with the celebrated Cardinal Farnese. The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.” Four years laterLives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architectswas published in Florence. The time and the man had come together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian Renaissance. Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (Fall 1959) ML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London by the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959.WR19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Linscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He originally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs. Jonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the DeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser translation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000 words.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the manuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s worth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates” (Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume DeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the U.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of pictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable moralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential Vasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to change the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has been done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a building it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American readers” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957). Linscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he thought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and an expensive illustrated edition by S & S [Simon and Schuster] with disgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print. Instead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff, inaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly accurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).",
