He is too important to us to take a chance” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set of proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of uncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the Penguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7 July 1958)."

They are so scattered it is difficult to obtain the more important parts.” Fadiman commented, “Not as crazy as it sounds—the Jung cult is fairly large, the name better and better known, and the Bollingen translations are good and easily buyable from Kurt [Wolff, the founder of Pantheon Books]” (Fadiman to Klopfer, 13 April 1956). Klopfer replied, “We have been negotiating with the Bollingen people for months, and expect to have a title in the Modern Library in 1957” (Klopfer to Fadiman, 20 April 1956)."

Linscott abridged the 10-volume DeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the U.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of pictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable moralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential Vasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to change the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has been done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a building it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American readers” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957)."

Instead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff, inaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly accurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957)."
