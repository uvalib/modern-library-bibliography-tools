    "This anthology covers the whole of Kierkegaard’s literary career. The selections range from the terse epigrams of theJournalthrough the famous “Diary of the Seducer” and the “Banquet” scene, in which S. K. reveals his great lyric and dramatic gifts, on to the philosophical and psychological works of his maturity. These are climaxed by the beautiful and moving religious discourses which accompany them; finally there is the biting satire of hisAttack upon“Christendom.”",
    "This is emphatically not a collection of “snippets,” but the cream of Kierkegaard, each selection interesting and intelligible in itself, and all ranking among his most important work. As theNew York Herald Tribunecommented, Mr. Bretall “has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what such remarks should be.” (Fall 1959)",

    "The ML paid Princeton University Press a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.A Kierkegaard Anthologyhad sold steadily in its Princeton University Press edition and seems to have done well in the ML. There was an unusually large ML printing of 22,200 copies in 1962.",
