<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1929</h1>
<h2>1929</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>With a few exceptions such as Villon, <em>Poems</em> (55) and <em>Passages from
the Diary of Samuel Pepys</em> (89), the Boni &amp; Liveright series remained
true to its name and limited its scope to modern works. Cerf and Klopfer
increased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added
Defoe, <em>Moll Flanders</em> (127) in 1926 and <em>The Autobiography of Benvenuto
Cellini</em> (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928
when Apuleius, <em>Golden Ass</em> (167), Sterne, <em>Tristram Shandy</em> (158), and
Rabelais, <em>Gargantua and Pantagruel</em> (162) were added. Five ML titles
published in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, <em>Satyricon</em> (156),
Smollett, <em>Expedition of Humphry Clinker</em> (159), Chaucer, <em>Canterbury
Tales</em> (161), and Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> (166) and <em>Odyssey</em> (167). Several of
these works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York
Society for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them
in the eyes of the shallowest modernist.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer were interested in publishing older classics besides
those that appealed specifically to modernist readers, but they
questioned whether the Modern Library was the appropriate vehicle for
them. Responding to a list of suggestions for the ML in 1928, Klopfer
commented, “The one that intrigues me most is the ‘Selected Poems of
John Donne’, although I am not sure that he would fit into the <em>Modern</em>
Library” (Klopfer to John W. Gassner, 22 March 1928).</p>
<p>For a time they contemplated starting a separate series of older
classics along the lines of Everyman’s Library. They scoured the lists
of Everyman’s Library, Loeb Classical Library, and the “100 Best Books”
for potential titles. The lists they compiled consisted mainly of
standard works of classical and English literature, together with those
of the Renaissance and, to a lesser extent, French literature. After
considering various names for the series, they seem to have settled
tentatively on the name Seven Seas Library; that at least is the name
that appears most often in penciled memos from this period. Other names
included Phoenix Library, Salamander Library, Pantheon Library, Mercury
Library, and Random House Classics.</p>
<p>Another possibility they considered was taking over an existing series
of standard classics. In 1929 Cerf wrote to J. M. Dent &amp; Co., the
English publishers of Everyman’s Library, offering to distribute the
series in the United States. American distribution of the series had
been handled since its inception by E. P. Dutton Co. The relationship
between the two firms was very close, and Dent had no interest in
changing American distribution of the series (Cerf to Hugh R. Dent, 12
December 1929; Dent to Cerf, 1 January 1930). Cerf’s inquiry may have
contributed to the soured relations between Dutton and the Modern
Library that persisted for many years.</p>
<p>In the end Cerf and Klopfer decided not to start a separate series of
older classics. Many of the works listed as potential titles for the
Seven Seas Library eventually found their way into the Modern Library.</p>
<p>Another change in scope was that the Modern Library gradually lost its
European orientation and became a series with neither European nor
American authors seemingly outweighing the other. Signs of increased
interest in American authors appeared soon after Cerf and Klopfer bought
the series. A 1926 advertisement featuring photographs of Modern Library
authors showed four Americans—Walt Whitman, Sherwood Anderson, James
Branch Cabell, and Eugene O’Neill—and one European, Anatole France (ML
advertisement, <em>New York Herald Tribune Books</em>, 7 November 1926). The
Modern Library catalogue for 1927, announcing publication of <em>The
Scarlet Letter</em>, stated: “The addition of this splendid novel is
consistent with the avowed intention of the publishers to include in the
Modern Library as many American authors as possible” (ML catalogue,
Spring-Summer 1927).</p>
<p>American authors were added regularly to the ML after 1925. No year went
by without the publication of works by Americans, but the balance was
not tipped suddenly in their favor. Of the twelve titles published in
1926, three were by Americans: Anderson, <em>Poor White</em> (121), Melville,
<em>Moby-Dick</em> (124), and Lewisohn, <em>Up Stream</em> (128). The greatest
concentration of Americans added to the series before 1930 came in 1927,
when six out of nineteen new titles were by American authors.</p>
<p>As with the inclusion of older classics, the new emphasis on American
works did not become abundantly clear until the 1930s. The stock market
crash of October 1929 ended seven years of prosperity, but the ML
entered the Depression in a strong position. As Cerf wrote in 1929, “The
Modern Library is no longer an experiment; it has become an institution
in the book world. . . . These ubiquitous books . . . at one time or
another have penetrated into nearly every American home and into the
libraries of many readers in other countries” (“The Modern Library,”
<em>Publishers’ Weekly</em>, 9 February 1929, p. 657; published anonymously but
written by Cerf).</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen titles, bringing the total number of
active titles to 167. No titles were discontinued. Minor discrepancies
between the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML
jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles
projected for January publication on fall lists.</p>
<p><strong>Format and printing</strong></p>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding
measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼
in. (164 x 107 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type and the last line of the title page as
PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Adler’s title
page was used with two different torchbearers. The six titles published
January–March had <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/B.webp'>torchbearer B</uvalib-modal-image-button>; the thirteen titles published
April-December reverted to Lucian Bernhard’s <uvalib-modal-image-button alt=' ' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>The imitation leather bindings used since 1917 had never been altogether
satisfactory. Castor oil used in manufacturing the imitation leather
caused the bindings to emit a fishy odor in warm weather. Cerf and
Klopfer began to think seriously about abandoning the imitation leather
bindings in 1928. After experimenting with various binding cloths, they
discovered a natural finish balloon cloth manufactured by the Siegbert
Book Cloth Corporation that seemed to meet their requirements. They
prepared samples of the new binding, with semi-flexible covers, and
showed them to several leading booksellers and department store buyers.
The response was favorable, and they decided to go ahead.</p>
<p>The balloon cloth binding was officially introduced with the Modern
Library’s January 1929 publications, Conrad Aiken’s <em>American Poetry
1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology</em> (169) and Gustave Flaubert’s
<em>Salammbô</em> (170). The old spine and cover design continued to be used
through March, but this was a temporary expedient. Shortly after they
decided to substitute balloon cloth for imitation leather, Cerf and
Klopfer asked Rockwell Kent, who had created the Random House device in
1927, to make a “simple . . . but characteristic Kentian design for the
back-strip” (Cerf to Kent, 11 December 1928). Kent more than fulfilled
his commission. He not only drew a striking new spine for Modern Library
book, but redesigned the torchbearer and created new endpapers as well.</p>
<p>Kent began with the idea of putting the torchbearer at the base of the
spine, but decided that the figure was too attenuated for the space
available. Still, he felt that the torch idea should be kept and wanted
to use a sizable spot of gold to make the spine distinctive. His first
solution was a design incorporating a candle. To Klopfer he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After, I assure you, making more designs for that book-back than there
are published works in the Modern Library; after considering and
rejecting innumerable pictorial designs, nudes, phallic symbols, and
so forth, as either inappropriate to book covers or indigestible to
middle western and New England patrons of your publications; I have
conceived and executed the somewhat trite, but I feel appropriate,
device which I enclose, and if you feel that in employing a candle as
part of it I have gone as far in suggestion as may be permitted,
please realize that I have shown some restraint in not making that
candle of the horrid dipped variety, so much in vogue in modern days
(Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The candle was never used. Cerf had warned Kent that the balloon cloth
would not take readily every kind of design, and the candle may have
been too detailed to be stamped clearly. At that point Kent decided that
nothing could be done with the original design and discarded it.</p>
<p>Three weeks later he sent in an entirely new design. The new design, he
noted, “should not only work out better in stamping but . . . in every
way pleases me more” (Kent to Klopfer, 16 February 1929). Intended for
the base of the spine, it consisted of an elegantly styled grape vine
with intertwined branches, leaves, and bunches of grapes. Beneath the
roots of the vine the words “Modern Library” were lettered in sans-serif
capitals. Kent recommended that the lettering for the title and author
at the head of the spine be drawn by hand. “You can get much more
satisfactory spacing in that way,” he wrote. “There are innumerable
professional letterers, any of whom can do this every month for you,
promptly and at little cost” (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929). The ML
does not appear to have adopted this suggestion.</p>
<p>For the front cover of the binding Kent redrew Bernhard’s torchbearer.
He thought Bernhard’s figure was “good in design, but too grotesque to
be in keeping with the serious nature of the Modern Library.” Kent drew
a more graceful, floating figure, with the torch, instead of being held
aloft, carried in front of the runner with the flare trailing over the
runner’s head. He omitted the words “Modern Library” which had encircled
Bernhard’s figure on the grounds that it was sufficient to have them on
the spine. He also made two other changes in the figure. Bernhard’s
figure faced left, toward the spine. Kent thought this a violation of
common sense and precedent in book design and turned it around. He also
altered its sex. Bernhard’s figure was assumed to be feminine; around
the Modern Library office it was known as “a dame running away from
Bennett Cerf.” Kent made his version neuter. “I defy you to discover the
figure’s sex,” he told Klopfer. “That’s modern enough for you” (ibid).</p>
<p>Kent’s binding design was introduced with <em>The Cabala</em> by Thornton
Wilder, the Modern Library’s April 1929 title. Bernhard’s torchbearer
was not completely superseded by Kent’s figure. It never again appeared
on the binding or endpaper, but it continued to be used on Modern
Library title pages and on many of the jackets.</p>
<p>Kent’s work for the Modern Library was a remarkable achievement in book
design. The combination of smooth balloon cloth and Kent’s spine and
front cover designs produced what were perhaps the handsomest volumes
the Modern Library ever published. Unfortunately, Kent’s design appears
to have been overly ambitious for books that retailed at ninety-five
cents. The extra gold it required increased the Modern Library’s binding
costs by half a cent per copy. That half cent doomed the design, and it
was used in its complete form for less than two years.</p>
<p>The balloon cloth bindings were available in four colors: red, blue,
green, and brown. The Modern Library published each title simultaneously
in all four bindings.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Two endpaper designs were used in 1929. Lucian Bernhard’s endpaper
printed in light yellowish brown remained in use through March. A new
endpaper designed by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April in
conjunction with his new binding. Copies of the first printing of
Thornton Wilder, <em>The Cabala</em> (175), which was published in April but
probably printed in March, exist with both endpapers. The paste-down and
free endpapers both featured Kent’s torchbearer at the center,
surrounded by a pattern of open books and the initials “ml”. The
conjunct endpapers were identical except that the two torchbearers faced
each other. For the first year Kent’s endpapers were available in four
different colors—light grayish red (18), dark yellowish pink (30), light
reddish brown (42), and pale green (149)—and were color coordinated with
the balloon cloth bindings. Red bindings had light grayish red
endpapers, blue and green bindings had pale green endpapers, and brown
bindings had dark yellowish pink or light reddish brown endpapers.</p>
<p>Beginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were printed in moderate
orange (53) and were used with all four binding colors. Moderate orange
endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930
through spring 1939, except for John Reed, <em>Ten Days That Shook the
World</em> (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the
larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that
fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper, with the central panels
with Kent’s torchbearer unchanged but with the surrounding pattern of
open books and the initials “ml” extended to fill the larger space, was
introduced in spring 1940.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>All 1929 titles except <em>The Memoirs of Casanova</em> (185) were originally
published in uniform typographic jacket D. The Casanova jacket has an
inset illustration of Casanova in left profile holding a candlestick in
one hand and opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle
casts a shadow of a satyr on the door. <em>The Memoirs of Casanova</em> appears
to be the first ML title to have been published initially in a pictorial
jacket without the option of a uniform typographic jacket.</p>
<p>An unknown number of ML titles were available in optional pictorial
jackets as well as the uniform typographic jacket.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p><em>Dating keys:</em> (Spring) Dostoyevsky, <em>Brothers Karamazov</em> xChaucer,
<em>Canterbury Tales</em>. (Fall) Chaucer, <em>Canterbury Tales</em> xHemingway, <em>Sun
Also Rises</em>.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>,
with sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929
best-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of
$5,000 to $10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in
the ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre,
Little, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of <em>All Quiet on the
Western Front</em> was published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, which distributed its
hardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast,
ML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and
the book departments of major department stores.</p>
<p>In another long shot, Cerf offered a $6,000 advance against royalties of
12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to
Lowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his
copyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive
reprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s
death, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.</p>
<p>Cerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford’s novel <em>The Honorable
Peter Stirling</em>, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset
&amp; Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset &amp;
Dunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book
(Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley
anthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11
December 1929).</p>
<p>Hendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, <em>Tolerance</em> (Boni &amp;
Liveright, 1925), noting that it was “the sort of book to appeal to the
free-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor”
(Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press
suggested André Tridon’s <em>Psychoanalysis</em>, originally published by B. W.
Huebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both
suggestions were rejected.</p>
<p>Several months after Edmond Rostand’s <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> (174)
appeared in the ML, Duffield &amp; Co. inquired if the ML would be
interested in Rostand’s later play <em>Chantecler</em> or Paul Verlaines’s
<em>Poems</em>. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in <em>The
History of Mr. Polly</em> by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24
October 1929).</p>
<p>Albert Mordell sent his book, <em>The Erotic Motive in Literature</em> (Boni &amp;
Liveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no
place in the ML because its “appeal is special, and many statements that
would have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today” (Cerf to
Mordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell’s book revived in the
1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier
Books and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several
translations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and
the first decade of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas gift boxes</strong></p>
<p>The ML produced three Christmas gift boxes in 1929. Each set consisted
of three ML titles in a slipcase. The books had specially designed
pictorial jackets and were advertised as “specially boxed and bound in
gay colors, with picture jackets” (ML ad, <em>PW</em> 116, 21 September 1929,
p. 1265). <em>Three Great French Romances</em> and <em>Three Great Modern Novels</em>
were new; <em>Three Great Renaissance Romances</em> was first offered as a
Christmas gift box in 1928. The Keratol bindings used in 1928 were
replaced by colored balloon cloth which the ML had introduced as its
standard binding earlier in the year. The pictorial jackets used for
<em>Three Great French Romances</em> and <em>Three Great Renaissance Romances</em>
were later adapted for use on regular ML printings. Hynd’s pictorial
jackets for the <em>Three Great Modern Novels</em> gift box were exceptional
examples of expressionist graphics but may have been too edgy for the
ML’s mainstream audience. Their use was limited to the 1929 gift box;
they were never adapted for use on copies of the books sold separately.
The retail price of each set was $2.85. The 1929 gift boxes were the
last, though unsold boxes continued to be listed in ML catalogs. The
three sets were:</p>
<p>1. <em>Three Great French Romances</em>: Zola, <em>Nana</em>; Gautier, <em>Mademoiselle
de Maupin</em>; Flaubert, <em>Madame Bovary</em>.</p>
<p>2. <em>Three Great Renaissance Romances:</em> Cellini, <em>Autobiography</em>;
Merejkowski, <em>Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em>; Symonds, <em>Life of

Conrad Aiken was guided in his selections for this volume by the

the poetry of older countries. With this conviction firmly in mind, he
could afford to eliminate some of the stodgy old bards and make place
for the refreshing and vital work of the poets who have arisen during

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br>
In revising this volume, Conrad Aiken was guided in his selections by
the principle that American poetry has reached the maturity and
dignity of the poetry of older countries. With this conviction in
mind, he could eliminate some of the stand-bys of older anthologies
and make place for the refreshing and vital work of the poets who have
arisen in the quarter of a century between the two world wars. This
anthology offers the work of the best American poets from the time of
the Revolution to the present day. (<em>Spring 1945</em>) <em>Note:</em> Front flap
reset in sans serif type from the flap text of 169.1a. It is not known
if the reversion to the earlier text was deliberate or accidental.

<p>Published February 1945. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1978/79. <em>Note:</em> The copyright date is 1944,
but publication of <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry</em> appears
to have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper
shortages.</p>
<p><em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> also comprised the
American portion of the ML Giant, <em>An Anthology of Famous English and
American Poetry</em> (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s
insistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra
Pound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was
later returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf
ignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve
omitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been
“overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include
a single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was
focused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any
suggestion of purging Pound from <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American
Poetry</em> or <em>Twentieth-Century American Poetry</em> (137.2), both of which
were published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s
poems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the
1947 printing (see G68).</p>
<p>Since the regular ML edition of <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American
Poetry</em> (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from
different type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two
formats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of
the two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of
the Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books
are printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point
size. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the
headline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type
pages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the
Giant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page,
but there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the
regular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries,
indexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular
edition and 420 pages in the Giant.</p>
<p><em>American Poetry 1671</em>–<em>1928</em> and <em>A Comprehensive Anthology of American
Poetry</em> do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee
Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American
poet. These and other African American poets had been represented in <em>An
Anthology of American Negro Literature</em> (183), edited by V. F. Calverton
and published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s
anthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time <em>A
Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry</em> appeared in 1945. The
revised edition of <em>An Anthology of American Negro Literature</em> (372),
edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and
1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies”
edited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice
M. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of
Calverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have
occurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets
from his anthology.</p>

<p>Cerf invited Will Durant to write an introduction to <em>Salammbô</em> after
Durant’s publishers, Richard L. Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster, told him
that Durant was an enthusiastic admirer of the work. Durant insisted on
a fee of $100, twice what the ML usually paid, and then submitted a
general essay on Flaubert. Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to
me much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much
too much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo.
And what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story”
(Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to
Durant, 10 September 1928). Durant indicated that he didn’t have time to
make changes, and the ML published <em>Salammbô</em> without an introduction.</p>
<p>Four years after <em>Salammbô</em> was discontinued, James T. Farrell suggested
Flaubert’s <em>Sentimental</em> <em>Education</em> for the ML (Farrell to Cerf, 1
February 1939). Cerf responded, “I am sorry to say that I see little
point in adding another Flaubert title to the Modern Library at this
time. We had to drop out both SALAMMBO and THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY
because of complete lack of demand, and even MADAME BOVARY doesn’t sell
one-quarter of what it did ten and fifteen years ago” (Cerf to Farrell,
2 February 1939).</p>

<p><em>Binding and endpaper variants:</em> The new binding design created by
Rockwell Kent was introduced in April 1929, but Kent tested his design
on copies of the first printing of <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, which was
scheduled for publication in February. <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> first
appeared with Bernhard endpapers in balloon cloth binding A with spine
lettering set from type. Copies of the first printing are also found in
balloon cloth binding with Kent’s grapevine design on the spine, his
torchbearer in gold on the front panel, and the title and author on the
spine stamped from lettering drawn by hand rather than set from metal
type. There is also an intermediate stage between binding A and binding
B1 which incorporates all elements of Kent’s design except hand
lettering on the spine. Later printings appeared in balloon cloth
bindings B2, with Kent’s torchbearer blind stamped on the front panel.
The ML appears to have rejected Kent’s recommendation to employ
letterers to create title and author statements for the binding spines
of subsequent titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Friedrich Nietzsche paid Fyodor Dostoyevsky the supreme compliment of
acknowledging him his teacher, for he learned from the Russian that
even a great criminal could be a great man. Dostoyevsky’s
understanding of every exaltation and humiliation of the human spirit,
his profound tenderness and compassion, his intensity and
psychological clairvoyance are nowhere so completely realized as in
<em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. Here the mystic and the realist at last come
into accord and give to the world this crowning achievement of
Dostoyevsky’s tormented and almost fabulous life. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Garnett translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co.,
1912. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.
Published February 1929. <em>WR</em> 23 March 1929. First printing: 20,000.
Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Klopfer inquired about the possibility of printing the ML edition from
Macmillan plates but was informed that the Macmillan Co. in New York
used printed sheets imported from England (Klopfer to George P. Brett,
Jr., Macmillan, 31 October 1928; Harold S. Latham, Macmillan, to
Klopfer, 9 November 1928). Cerf and Klopfer decided to assume the cost
of original composition and announced that the ML edition was the first
to be printed in the United States. Other publishers, they noted,
“always imported it from England rather than undergo the great expense
of making a new set of plates for so lengthy a book” (ML circular, RH
box 133, Advertising 1929 folder 2). At 988 pages <em>The Brothers
Karamazov</em> was longest book the ML had published up to that time.</p>
<p><em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> sold about 30,000 copies in its first
two-and-a-half years in the ML (Cerf to Robert Linscott, 9 October
1931). It ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. In the
early 1950s (November 1951–October 1952) it was the twelfth best-selling
title in the ML; the Giant edition (G34) ranked in the second quarter of
ML titles.</p>
<p><em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> was one of four works to be published in the
regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included in
all three series were Cervantes, <em>Don Quixote</em> (1930: 197), Giant (1934:
G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Fielding, <em>History of Tom Jones</em> (1931:
208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943: IML 5); and Whitman, <em>Poems</em>
(1921: 94.1), title changed to <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1929), <em>Leaves of

<p>Among the great novels of the world, <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> stands
preeminent. It captures and conveys the highest exaltation and the
deepest humiliation of the human spirit; it probes the soul and
reveals, with profound psychological clairvoyance, the plight of man
in search for some truth about himself. In Fyodor Dostoyevsky the
mystic and the realist at last come into accord, and by his compassion
and understanding he creates one of the enduring novels in Russian and
world literature. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published with Slonim’s introduction in MLCE, 1950. Other

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Among the great novels of the world, <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> stands
preeminent. It captures and conveys the highest exaltation and the
deepest humiliation of the human spirit; it proves the soul and
reveals, with profound psychological clairvoyance, the plight of man
in search for some truth about himself. In Fyodor Dostoyevsky the
mystic and the realist at last come into accord, and by his compassion
and understanding he creates one of the enduring novels in Russian and
world literature.</p>

The problems of abnormal psychology are as manifold as the problems of
modern life. To understand the origins and manifestations of the
psychoses that afflict us, we must come to a better comprehension of
the biological and social factors involved. This handbook gives an
all–inclusive view of the interrelationship of mental diseases to the
forces in modern life which cause them. Here eminent authorities speak
in non–technical terms for the layman, that he may better understand
the causes and consequences of a maladjusted mental equipment.

<p>Cerf asked Everett Dean Martin of the New School for Social Research in
1926 if there was any chance of including his book <em>Psychology: What It
Has to Teach You about Yourself and Your World</em> (W. W. Norton, 1924) in
the ML. If not, he asked whether Martin would be interested in compiling
an anthology on psychology as a companion to <em>An Outline of
Psychoanalysis</em> (108). Martin replied negatively to both (Cerf to
Martin, 21 September 1926; Martin to Cerf, 28 September 1926).</p>
<p>Cerf turned next to Gardner Murphy, who received royalties of 5 cents a
copy.</p>
<p><em>An Outline of Abnormal Psychology</em> sold 1,634 copies during the first
six months of 1930 and 1,113 copies during the first six months of the
following year. It ranked low in the second quarter of ML titles in
terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It did
not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during
1951–52.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Abnormality, as Hippocrates suggested centuries ago, is essentially a
matter of defect or of exaggeration, and so the line between what is
normal behavior and what is abnormal behavior is a thin, shifting one.
In the study of the range of human variability lies a key to
sympathetic understanding of those who suffer the tragedy of a sick,
disturbed mind. In such study, too, lies a key to a greater capacity
to understand one’s own emotional and social growth and thus to cope
more skillfully with the endless problems, crises, and frustrations of
everyday living. In this book, eminent authorities, using
non-technical language, introduce the layman to the scope and the new
horizons of abnormal psychology. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Revised edition published fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 16 October 1954. First
printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Murphy wrote Cerf in 1953 that a revision of <em>An Outline of Abnormal
Psychology</em> was badly needed. He indicated that he had recently reviewed
the selections in the 1929 edition and that in almost every instance it
would be possible to select a superior example to represent current
research and practice. He noted that he would need a collaborator who
was familiar with fields in which he was not up-to-date (Murphy to Cerf,
14 January 1953).</p>
<p>Stein replied four months later that the ML was planning revisions of
several titles, including <em>An Outline of Abnormal Psychology</em>. He
suggested that Murphy engage a collaborator for a flat fee of $300,
which would be paid as an advance against Murphy’s royalties, and
indicated that the ML would pay up to $300 for permissions. The royalty
rate was to remain at 5 cents a copy (Stein to Murphy, 15 May 1953).
Murphy thought that $500 should be the minimum fee for a collaborator
but believed that permissions would be less than $300. Stein agreed to
the $500 collaborator’s fee and reduced the permissions budget to $200
(Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953; Stein to Murphy, 29 May 1953). Murphy
selected Bachrach as his collaborator. Bachrach made the preliminary
selection of contents, and Murphy wrote a new introduction. The revised
edition contained completely new material.</p>
<p>The American Institute of Graphic Arts selected <em>An Outline of Abnormal
Psychology</em> as one of the fifty best books of 1954 (<em>Fifty Books of the
Year 1954: Catalog of the Thirty-third Annual Exhibition</em> [New York:
American Institute of Graphic Arts, 1955], p. 34). The book was

historical romance woven around Julian the Apostate, the first Roman

paganism and Christianity provide Merejkowski with setting and theme

unerring swordsman, this understudy knight of chivalry and

Edmond Rostand’s swaggering drama, all its poetical extravagance and

</blockquote>
<p>Hooker translation originally published by Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1923. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March
1929. <em>WR</em> 27 April 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1973/74.</p>
<p>The Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the
text and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of
10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new
plates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first
30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a $3,400 advance in December 1928
against royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.</p>
<p>In 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of <em>Cyrano de
Bergerac</em> at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the
president of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed
concern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but
he acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely
putting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your
mind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at
high schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have
proposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on
your own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18
June 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).</p>
<p><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during
the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth
best-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October
1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose
Ferrer.</p>

<p>Jacques Le Clercq, whose translations of Rabelais’s <em>Gargantua and
Pantagruel</em> (G66) and Dumas’s <em>Three Musketeers</em> (153.2) were published
in the ML in 1944 and 1950, indicated in 1953 that he was working a
rhymed verse translation of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> and inquired if the ML
would be interested in it. He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is
superb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though
a perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was
inherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider
changing the translation, which had “established itself as standard for
many college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953;
Commins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton
University Library). Le Clercq’s translation of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>
does not appear to have been published.</p>
<p>By 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML
edition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep <em>Cyrano</em> in
the series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt
accept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new
plates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time
Holt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C.
Edwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May
1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the
mid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.</p>

<p><em>Format: The Cabala</em> was the first ML title published in balloon cloth
binding B. Copies with the statement “First Modern Library Edition |
1929” have been seen with the Bernhard endpaper, which was used through
March 1929, the month in which the first printing was probably made, and
also the Kent endpaper, which began to be used in April, the month in
which <em>The Cabala</em> was published. The earliest copies sold were almost
certainly those in the Bernhard endpaper. Copies examined in jacket B
have the Kent endpaper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The sensational success of <em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</em> obscured for a
time the fine lustre of Thornton Wilder’s earlier work, <em>The Cabala</em>.
But critics and an enthusiastic minority of readers clung to their
preference for the calm and suave classicism of the Italian tale in
the Henry James tradition. The restraint and the mystical implications
of <em>The Cabala</em>, the imaginative subtlety with which it is endowed,
the firmness of its characterizations, its wit and irony, give it a
place of eminence among contemporary novels. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Albert &amp; Charles Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp.
[iii], [3]–230) printed from Boni plates. The heading of the
contents page of Boni printings was changed from <em>The Cabala</em> to
<em>Contents</em> at some point between the sixth printing (January 1928) and
the tenth printing (August 1928); ML printings use the second version of
the contents page. Published April 1929. <em>WR</em> 11 May 1929. First
printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1937.</p>
<p>Cerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know
that you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote,
“particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an
introduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to
send it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is
going to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford
to buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be
made up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words
stating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in
this edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double
the ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the
last moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an
introduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March
1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the
end of March.</p>
<p><em>The Cabala</em> sold well during its first two or three years in the
series. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and
another printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in
the RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Abbey Classics edition with Scott Moncrieff introduction originally
published in U.S. by Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1923, using sheets of the
English edition. ML edition (pp. v–238) follows the text of the Abbey
Classics edition with the substitution of modern typesetting conventions
for Burnaby’s 17th-century practice of capitalizing nouns within
sentences. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for May 1929. <em>WR</em> 13 July 1929. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.</p>
<p><em>The Satyricon</em> was written during the reign of Nero. The Burnaby
translation, originally published in 1694, was the first in English.
Burnaby included supplements to the text, later shown to be spurious,
that had been “discovered” in 1688. The first page of the ML text is
headed: THE SATYRICON | OF PETRONIUS | <em>THE SATYR OF</em> | <em>TITUS PETRONIUS
ARBITER</em> | <em>With its Fragments, recover’d at Buda, 1688</em>. (p. 1).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 2,015 copies during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943, making it one of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles.
It did not rank among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
From the time Honoré de Balzac pronounced Stendhal’s preeminence among
the novelists of France until today, the author of <em>The Red and the
Black</em> has retained and spread his influence among writers of every
nationality. His story of Julien Sorel is incomparably the most astute
and penetrating study of middle-class mores in all fiction. It is, in
addition, a relentless dissection of the hypocrisy and opportunism of
as unconscionable an upstart as ever violated the Seventh and other
Commandments in order to get on in the world. (<em>Spring 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes
by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1926. ML edition (pp. v–[288]; v–[352]) printed
from B&amp;L plates. Published June 1929. <em>WR</em> 13 July 1929. First printing:
4,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissue format, 1984.</p>
<p>The ML hyphenates the translator’s name as Scott-Moncrieff on the 177a
title page and omits the hyphen in 177b‑e. Boni &amp; Liveright was also
inconsistent in its multi-volume <em>Works of Stendhal</em>, hyphenating the
translator’s name on the title page of <em>The Red and the Black</em> and
omitting the hyphen on the title page of <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em> and
the jackets of both works.</p>
<p>The ML paid Liveright royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Red and the Black</em> ranked high in the fourth quarter of ML titles
in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It
rose to the first quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period
November 1951–October 1952. The dramatic increase in sales may reflect
use of <em>The Red and the Black</em> in college literature courses after the
Second World War, when enrollments increased dramatically as large
numbers of veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill to earn college
degrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
“True passion,” Stendhal wrote, “never thinks of anything but itself.”
Based on an actual incident that Stendhal read about in the <em>Gazette
des Tribunaux</em> in 1827, <em>The Red and the Black</em> is a brilliant
psychological portrait of passion, opportunism and political intrigue
set in 19th-century Restoration France. It is the story of Julien
Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose
prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless
egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the
calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent
Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are
intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The
contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict
between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp
in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois
mores and French society, <em>The Red and the Black</em> established Stendhal
as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.</p>

The glory that was Greece is nowhere so luminously reflected as in the
mirror of her drama. Through the masks of tragedy and comedy, nobility
and villainy, and all the duality of the human spirit, the life of man
glows to passion and grows dim. Pity and terror in Æschylus, serene
detachment in Sophocles, burning fervor for justice in Euripides and
the robust intellectual comedy of Aristophanes—these qualities remain
the message and the meaning of Greek drama. It is a heritage from
antiquity that the modern spirit needs. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The rogues’ gallery of scoundrels and lusty wenches that gave flavor
to <em>Roderick Random</em> and <em>Peregrine Pickle</em> is matched by as humorous
an array of delightful and cantankerous characters in <em>Humphry
Clinker</em>. Here, too, are the caustic turns of speech, the sardonic wit
and the acute powers of observation that have made Smollett’s books a
plunder house for English writers during almost two centuries. And
here, above all, is Smollett in a genial and mellow mood, but candid
and outspoken, with the healthy frankness of the eighteenth century.
(<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>

<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published

<p>Cerf wanted to include a volume of Machen’s stories in the ML and
proposed the idea to him when he visited London in summer 1926. <em>The
Hill of Dreams</em> and <em>The House of Souls</em> were in the U.S. public domain,
but Machen, who badly needed the money a ML edition would bring, felt he
could approve the proposal only if Alfred A. Knopf, his American
publisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached
Knopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He
told Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an
introduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s
usual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf
to Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that <em>Humphry Clinker</em>, “the
work of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he
thought that <em>Roderick Random</em> was “more characteristically Smollett:
rough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin
with. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with
his order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April
1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he
wrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.</p>
<p><em>Humphry Clinker</em> ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of
sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank
among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month
period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
The rogues’ gallery of ruffians and lusty wenches that gave so much
color to <em>Roderick Random</em> and <em>Peregrine Pickle</em> is matched by an
array of cantankerous characters in <em>Humphry Clinker</em>. Here, in the
last of his novels as in the others, are the wit and wisdom, the acute
powers of observation, and the sharp turn of phrase that characterize
all of Tobias Smollett’s work. Here is Smollett, grown tolerant of
human frailty after having screamed against it in <em>Roderick Random</em>,
now writing in the mellow, satiric vein of amiable elderly people in
whom there is a hard core of eccentricity. <em>Humphry Clinker</em>, now
almost two hundred years old, still retains the freshness and the
vigor of the best of the eighteenth-century novels. (<em>Spring 1955</em>)</p>

To classify <em>The Dance of Life</em> as a book of philosophy, as a
spiritual autobiography or even as a book of personal affirmations
does it scant justice. It is all of these and more. It is a book of
aspiration, of growth and of revelation, written by a man who has
partaken of life and contributed to its wisdom, grace and idealism.
<em>The Dance of Life</em> may be considered the crowning achievement of
Havelock Ellis’s life; it epitomizes his spirit and his work. (<em>Spring
1938</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1923. ML edition
printed from Houghton Mifflin plates made from a new typesetting.
Published September 1929. <em>WR</em> 26 October 1929. First printing: 15,000
copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.</p>
<p>In addition to the ML printing, the new plates were used for 1929
printings in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library and the Book League of
America. A revised index keyed to the new typesetting appears in ML and
Book League of America printings but not the Riverside Library printing,
which ends on p. 342, the last page of text. The Book League of America
contents page lists the index while the ML’s doesn’t. Ellis’s new
foreword is unique to ML printings.</p>
<p>The ML paid Houghton Mifflin an undetermined advance against royalties
on the first 50,000 copies. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies
in March 1931; printings reached 50,000 copies by October 1945.</p>
<p><em>The Dance of Life</em> ranked in the 3rd quarter of ML titles in terms of

For centuries commentators have sought a particular attribute by which
Chaucer earned the title of “the father of English poetry.” Now the
secret of his genius no longer lies merely in his incomparable
narrative powers, nor in his technical mastery. His unfailing vitality
and his myriad attachments to reality and imagination reveal the true
scope of the man and the poet. The Modern Library edition of <em>The
Canterbury Tales</em> makes his masterpiece available to scholar and
general reader alike in its most authoritative version. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:</p>
<p>The path of Lilly Czepanek’s destiny was made radiant and tragic by her
own beauty. Her life was consecrated to love. As it was with Shulamite,
who inspired Solomon’s Song of Songs, so love had set a seal upon
Lilly’s heart. All the denials of poverty, the violences of lechery and
the longings of her own dream world only made her more desirable in the
eyes of men. Hermann Sudermann’s novel of a woman who walked in sin is a
romance in the cause of love beyond purity. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
<p>Seltzer translation originally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1909, and
after 1925 by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [3]–640) printed from
Huebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title.
Published October 1929. <em>WR</em> 23 November 1929. First printing: 8,000
copies. Discontinued 1 January 1942.</p>
<p>ML printings do not identify the translator. Huebsch and Viking
printings attribute the translation to Thomas Seltzer, but it was
actually by his wife Adele Seltzer, who wanted to publicize her
husband’s name. Thomas Seltzer’s contribution was typing the manuscript
that was submitted to Huebsch (Levin, <em>Dare to Be Different</em>, pp. 85,
269).</p>
<p>The ML paid Viking royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were three
additional printings of 2,000 copies each between April 1930 and April
1931 and five known printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1932
and April 1941.</p>
<p>Sudermann’s novel was read more widely in the early decades of the 20th
century than it is today. Jackets of early ML printings of <em>Madame
Bovary</em> (25.1) state on the front panel: “Today there are two more
novels that are likely to be classed with [<em>Madame Bovary</em>] . . .
Tolstoy’s ‘Anna Karenina’ and Sudermann’s ‘Song of Songs.’” (see 25.1a).</p>

<p>Text on front:</p>
<p>A comprehensive anthology that presents a striking picture of the
intellectual development of the American negro. The volume contains
short stories, significant excerpts from novels, essays, spirituals,
poetry, and blues, and includes contributions by Booker T. Washington,
Walter White, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Eric Walrond, Countee Cullen,
and many others. (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published October 1929. <em>WR</em> 23 November 1929.
First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1944 by a revised edition
edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins (372).</p>
<p>When W. C. Handy authorized the inclusion of five blues he had
copyrighted, he stipulated that copyright notices were to be printed on
the same pages as the lyrics. Calverton acknowledged Handy generously in
the preface but neglected to include the individual copyright notices.
Handy or his representative contacted the ML shortly after publication,
insisting that the agreement be honored. Klopfer contacted the ML’s
legal counsel about the matter (Klopfer to Edwin A. Falk, 27 November
1929). He subsequently wrote to H. Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders,
informing them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected
sheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s
truckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s
stock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,”
he stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly
printed” (Klopfer to Miss J. A. Lanning, H. Wolff Estate, 26 December
1929). The corrected state of the first printing is described under
183a<sub>2</sub><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Calverton’s <em>Anthology of American Negro Literature</em> sold 3,243 copies
during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it near
the top of the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.</p>
<p>Calverton’s anthology was superseded in 1944 by a new edition edited by
Sylvestre C. Watkins (372). Watkins omitted poetry and other material.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Negro achievement in the arts has kept pace with a change in
intellectual conviction. Injustice and discrimination have proven a
challenge, and that challenge is being answered with the literature
produced by the colored race during the last decade. This anthology
gives a comprehensive picture of the struggle of a people to affirm
its own genius. It is representative of a new consciousness; it gives
evidence of a determination to end the admission of inferiority and to
begin to assert the unique and durable qualities of a race. (<em>Fall

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “Mr. Van
Vechten’s most popular novel introduces a continuous procession of
restless modern sophisticates—artists, writers, actors, and the like.
They are drawn from life, and indeed, many of them appear under their
own names.” (<em>Fall 1929</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–247) printed from Knopf plates. Published November 1929. <em>WR</em> 21
December 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.</p>
<p>James Crowder, the ML’s midwestern sales representative, suggested the
inclusion of <em>Peter Whiffle</em> (Crowder to Cerf, 21 December 1928). At
this time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering
resentment over the ML edition of <em>Green Mansions</em> (90). However, Cerf
had become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying
to put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928).
Relations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929
luncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a $1,000 advance
against royalties of 10 cents a copy for <em>Peter Whiffle</em>. He also
offered to pay Van Vechten $100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an
introduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated
that he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van
Vechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf
turned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929). <em>Peter
Whiffle</em> was the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the
ML.</p>
<p>There was a second printing of 1,000 copies in August 1932.</p>

full-sized edition with illustrations by Victor Candell was published by
Garden City later that year under the imprint Sun Dial Press.</p>

The pursuit of women and adventure was the principal activity of

When old age tempered his passions, he retired to write the
recollections of his youthful escapades. The manuscript which has come
down to us from the eighteenth century in various condensations has
delighted those readers who cultivate an interest in accounts of
forbidden pleasures. It has also brought a little discomfort to the
prudish-minded. This edition includes some of the most vivid

<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none
is in greater favor than Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> and its companion volume,
<em>The Odyssey</em> (No. 167). The immortal epic of the wrath of Achilles
and the siege of Troy is as vivid to the contemporary reader as it
must have been to Homer’s first enraptured listeners seven centuries
before the Christian era, and as it has remained through the ages in
its various renderings. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation was chosen
upon the urgent advice of the leading authorities in England and
America. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lang-Leaf-Myers translation originally published in U.S. by the
Macmillan Co., 1883. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published December 1929. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing:
Not ascertained. Superseded fall 1964 by Rees translation (186.2).</p>
<p>The ML originally planned to use the 17th-century translations of George
Chapman for its editions of Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. Advance
advertising referred to the Chapman translations, as did fall 1929
catalogs and ML lists—including the lists inside first printings of the
Homer jackets. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of <em>The Iliad</em> and the
Butcher and Lang translation of <em>The Odyssey</em> were substituted at the
last moment on the advice of several college professors. “We discovered
that we could sell five times as many books in the new translation as we
could have had we used the Chapman, since the Lang, Leaf, and Myers one
is used in almost all of the colleges” (Cerf to George M. McKanday,
Macmillan Co. of Canada, 25 November 1930).</p>
<p>The Prefatory Note (p. [<em>5</em>]) indicates that Books I–IX were
translated by Leaf, X–XVI by Lang, and XVII–XXIV by Myers, but that the
whole was revised by all three translators.</p>
<p>The ML hoped to use Macmillan plates, but Macmillan had to secure
approval from its parent firm in London and was unable to make a solid
offer until the end of October. By that time the ML had begun
composition so that the books could be published in December.</p>
<p><em>The Iliad</em> ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles
during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and rose into the lower
part of the first quarter during the 12-month period November
1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 122,292 copies by spring 1958.</p>

<p>Highet received $300 for his introductions to <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The
Odyssey</em> (Stein to Highet, 26 January 1950). The first section of the
introductions (“The World of the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>”) is common
to both volumes, as is the bibliography. Highet’s introductions were
also included in printings of <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em> in Modern
Library College Editions, which were introduced in fall 1950. Most of
the introductions written for MLCE appeared first in that series and
were subsequently added to regular ML printings.</p>
<p>The Prefatory Note and the poems on pp. [<em>6</em>] and [465] of 186.1a–b

<p>Myers’s name was misspelled on the reset title page. Highet pointed out
the error shortly after publication (Highet to Crary, 8 September 1950).
There is a memo in the RH Papers ordering the correction on the MLCE
title page. The title page of the regular ML edition does not appear to
have been corrected.</p>

<p>Rees translation originally published by Random House, 1963. ML edition
(pp. v–529) printed from RH plates with the dedication and title page
adapted from the RH printing. Published fall 1964. <em>WR</em> 16 November
1964. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1982/83.</p>
<p>Epstein wanted to include Richmond Lattimore’s verse translation of <em>The
Iliad</em> in the ML in 1960, but reprint rights do not appear to have been
available (Epstein to Roger Shugg, University of Chicago Press, 6
January 1960). RH published Rees’s verse translation of <em>The Odyssey</em>
later that year, followed by his verse translation of <em>The Iliad</em> in
1963. Rees’s volumes were designed so that the plates could be used for
ML printings.</p>
<p>The ML title page reproduces the title exactly as it appears in the RH
printing, but the statement of responsibility for the translator
(TRANSLATED BY | ENNIS REES) and the imprint are reduced in size,
significantly improving the balance and aesthetic appeal of the ML title
page. The dedication facing the title page is reduced from four lines in
the RH printing (THIS TRANSLATION | IS DEDICATED | TO JEFFREY, AMY, |

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none
is in greater favor than Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em> and its companion
volume, <em>The Iliad</em> (No. 166). The immortal epic of the ten-year
wanderings of Ulysses remains as vivid to the contemporary reader as
it was when first recited to Homer’s enthralled audience many
centuries before the Christian era. The Modern Library edition of the
Butcher and Lang prose translation has been adopted by many leading
universities as the standard text of this classic. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butcher and Lang translation originally published in U.S. by the
Macmillan Co., 1879. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published December 1929. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing:
Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1962 by Rees translation (187.2).</p>
<p>See 186.1a for information about the selection of the Butcher and Lang

<p><em>The Odyssey</em> ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles
during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943, slightly below <em>The
Iliad</em>. It was near the top of the second quarter during the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952, four titles below <em>The Iliad</em>.</p>

<p>Rees translation originally published by Random House, 1960. ML edition
(pp. vii–416) printed from RH plates, with the title page adapted from
the original plates. Published spring 1962. <em>WR</em> 4 June 1962. First
printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Rees’s translation of <em>The Odyssey</em> filled the need for a modern verse
translation. Richmond Lattimore’s verse translation of <em>The Odyssey</em> did
not appear until 1967, sixteen years after his translation of <em>The
Iliad</em>. The Lattimore translation probably would not have been available
to the ML in any case. Rees’s verse translation of <em>The Iliad</em> was
published in 1963 and was added to the ML the following year (see
186.2). Both of Rees’s volumes were designed so that the plates could be
used for ML printings.</p>
<p>The ML title page reproduces the title exactly as it appears in the RH
printing, but the statement of responsibility for the translator
(TRANSLATED BY | ENNIS REES) and the imprint are reduced in size,
significantly improving the balance and aesthetic appeal of the ML title
page. The 3-line dedication facing the title page in the RH printing,
which is identical to that in Rees’s translation of <em>The Iliad</em>, is
shifted in the ML printing to the recto of the third leaf (p. [v]).</p>

Calverton acknowledged Handy generously in\nthe preface but neglected to include the individual copyright notices.\nHandy or his representative contacted the ML shortly after publication,\ninsisting that the agreement be honored. Klopfer contacted the ML’s\nlegal counsel about the matter (Klopfer to Edwin A. Falk, 27 November\n1929). He subsequently wrote to H. Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders,\ninforming them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected\nsheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s\ntruckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s\nstock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,”\nhe stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly\nprinted” (Klopfer to Miss J. A.

Cerf and Klopfer\nincreased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added\nDefoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto\nCellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928\nwhen Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and\nRabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles\npublished in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156),\nSmollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury\nTales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of\nthese works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York\nSociety for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them\nin the eyes of the shallowest modernist.\n\nCerf and Klopfer were interested in publishing older classics besides\nthose that appealed specifically to modernist readers, but they\nquestioned whether the Modern Library was the appropriate vehicle for\nthem. Responding to a list of suggestions for the ML in 1928, Klopfer\ncommented, “The one that intrigues me most is the ‘Selected Poems of\nJohn Donne’, although I am not sure that he would fit into the *Modern*\nLibrary” (Klopfer to John W. Gassner, 22 March 1928).\n\nFor a time they contemplated starting a separate series of older\nclassics along the lines of Everyman’s Library. They scoured the lists\nof Everyman’s Library, Loeb Classical Library, and the “100 Best Books”\nfor potential titles. The lists they compiled consisted mainly of\nstandard works of classical and English literature, together with those\nof the Renaissance and, to a lesser extent, French literature. After\nconsidering various names for the series, they seem to have settled\ntentatively on the name Seven Seas Library; that at least is the name\nthat appears most often in penciled memos from this period. Other names\nincluded Phoenix Library, Salamander Library, Pantheon Library, Mercury\nLibrary, and Random House Classics.\n\nAnother possibility they considered was taking over an existing series\nof standard classics. In 1929 Cerf wrote to J. M. Dent & Co., the\nEnglish publishers of Everyman’s Library, offering to distribute the\nseries in the United States. American distribution of the series had\nbeen handled since its inception by E. P. Dutton Co. The relationship\nbetween the two firms was very close, and Dent had no interest in\nchanging American distribution of the series (Cerf to Hugh R. Dent, 12\nDecember 1929; Dent to Cerf, 1 January 1930). Cerf’s inquiry may have\ncontributed to the soured relations between Dutton and the Modern\nLibrary that persisted for many years.\n\nIn the end Cerf and Klopfer decided not to start a separate series of\nolder classics. Many of the works listed as potential titles for the\nSeven Seas Library eventually found their way into the Modern Library.\n\nAnother change in scope was that the Modern Library gradually lost its\nEuropean orientation and became a series with neither European nor\nAmerican authors seemingly outweighing the other. Signs of increased\ninterest in American authors appeared soon after Cerf and Klopfer bought\nthe series. A 1926 advertisement featuring photographs of Modern Library\nauthors showed four Americans—Walt Whitman, Sherwood Anderson, James\nBranch Cabell, and Eugene O’Neill—and one European, Anatole France (ML\nadvertisement, *New York Herald Tribune Books*, 7 November 1926). The\nModern Library catalogue for 1927, announcing publication of *The\nScarlet Letter*, stated: “The addition of this splendid novel is\nconsistent with the avowed intention of the publishers to include in the\nModern Library as many American authors as possible” (ML catalogue,\nSpring-Summer 1927).\n\nAmerican authors were added regularly to the ML after 1925. No year went\nby without the publication of works by Americans, but the balance was\nnot tipped suddenly in their favor. Of the twelve titles published in\n1926, three were by Americans: Anderson, *Poor White* (121), Melville,\n*Moby-Dick* (124), and Lewisohn, *Up Stream* (128). The greatest\nconcentration of Americans added to the series before 1930 came in 1927,\nwhen six out of nineteen new titles were by American authors.\n\nAs with the inclusion of older classics, the new emphasis on American\nworks did not become abundantly clear until the 1930s. The stock market\ncrash of October 1929 ended seven years of prosperity, but the ML\nentered the Depression in a strong position. As Cerf wrote in 1929, “The\nModern Library is no longer an experiment; it has become an institution\nin the book world. . . . These ubiquitous books . . . at one time or\nanother have penetrated into nearly every American home and into the\nlibraries of many readers in other countries” (“The Modern Library,”\n*Publishers’ Weekly*, 9 February 1929, p. 657; published anonymously but\nwritten by Cerf).\n\n### Number of titles\n\nCerf and Klopfer added nineteen titles, bringing the total number of\nactive titles to 167. No titles were discontinued. Minor discrepancies\nbetween the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML\njackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles\nprojected for January publication on fall lists.\n\n**Format and printing**\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and the last line of the title page as\nPUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Adler’s title\npage was used with two different torchbearers. The six titles published\nJanuary–March had torchbearer B; the thirteen titles published\nApril-December reverted to Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2.\n\n### Binding\n\nThe imitation leather bindings used since 1917 had never been altogether\nsatisfactory. Castor oil used in manufacturing the imitation leather\ncaused the bindings to emit a fishy odor in warm weather. Cerf and\nKlopfer began to think seriously about abandoning the imitation leather\nbindings in 1928. After experimenting with various binding cloths, they\ndiscovered a natural finish balloon cloth manufactured by the Siegbert\nBook Cloth Corporation that seemed to meet their requirements. They\nprepared samples of the new binding, with semi-flexible covers, and\nshowed them to several leading booksellers and department store buyers.\nThe response was favorable, and they decided to go ahead.\n\nThe balloon cloth binding was officially introduced with the Modern\nLibrary’s January 1929 publications, Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry\n1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology* (169) and Gustave Flaubert’s\n*Salammbô* (170). The old spine and cover design continued to be used\nthrough March, but this was a temporary expedient. Shortly after they\ndecided to substitute balloon cloth for imitation leather, Cerf and\nKlopfer asked Rockwell Kent, who had created the Random House device in\n1927, to make a “simple . . . but characteristic Kentian design for the\nback-strip” (Cerf to Kent, 11 December 1928). Kent more than fulfilled\nhis commission. He not only drew a striking new spine for Modern Library\nbook, but redesigned the torchbearer and created new endpapers as well.\n\nKent began with the idea of putting the torchbearer at the base of the\nspine, but decided that the figure was too attenuated for the space\navailable. Still, he felt that the torch idea should be kept and wanted\nto use a sizable spot of gold to make the spine distinctive. His first\nsolution was a design incorporating a candle. To Klopfer he wrote:\n\n> After, I assure you, making more designs for that book-back than there\n> are published works in the Modern Library; after considering and\n> rejecting innumerable pictorial designs, nudes, phallic symbols, and\n> so forth, as either inappropriate to book covers or indigestible to\n> middle western and New England patrons of your publications; I have\n> conceived and executed the somewhat trite, but I feel appropriate,\n> device which I enclose, and if you feel that in employing a candle as\n> part of it I have gone as far in suggestion as may be permitted,\n> please realize that I have shown some restraint in not making that\n> candle of the horrid dipped variety, so much in vogue in modern days\n> (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929).\n\nThe candle was never used. Cerf had warned Kent that the balloon cloth\nwould not take readily every kind of design, and the candle may have\nbeen too detailed to be stamped clearly. At that point Kent decided that\nnothing could be done with the original design and discarded it.\n\nThree weeks later he sent in an entirely new design. The new design, he\nnoted, “should not only work out better in stamping but . . . in every\nway pleases me more” (Kent to Klopfer, 16 February 1929). Intended for\nthe base of the spine, it consisted of an elegantly styled grape vine\nwith intertwined branches, leaves, and bunches of grapes. Beneath the\nroots of the vine the words “Modern Library” were lettered in sans-serif\ncapitals. Kent recommended that the lettering for the title and author\nat the head of the spine be drawn by hand. “You can get much more\nsatisfactory spacing in that way,” he wrote. “There are innumerable\nprofessional letterers, any of whom can do this every month for you,\npromptly and at little cost” (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929). The ML\ndoes not appear to have adopted this suggestion.\n\nFor the front cover of the binding Kent redrew Bernhard’s torchbearer.\nHe thought Bernhard’s figure was “good in design, but too grotesque to\nbe in keeping with the serious nature of the Modern Library.” Kent drew\na more graceful, floating figure, with the torch, instead of being held\naloft, carried in front of the runner with the flare trailing over the\nrunner’s head. He omitted the words “Modern Library” which had encircled\nBernhard’s figure on the grounds that it was sufficient to have them on\nthe spine. He also made two other changes in the figure. Bernhard’s\nfigure faced left, toward the spine. Kent thought this a violation of\ncommon sense and precedent in book design and turned it around. He also\naltered its sex. Bernhard’s figure was assumed to be feminine; around\nthe Modern Library office it was known as “a dame running away from\nBennett Cerf.” Kent made his version neuter. “I defy you to discover the\nfigure’s sex,” he told Klopfer. “That’s modern enough for you” (ibid).\n\nKent’s binding design was introduced with *The Cabala* by Thornton\nWilder, the Modern Library’s April 1929 title. Bernhard’s torchbearer\nwas not completely superseded by Kent’s figure. It never again appeared\non the binding or endpaper, but it continued to be used on Modern\nLibrary title pages and on many of the jackets.\n\nKent’s work for the Modern Library was a remarkable achievement in book\ndesign. The combination of smooth balloon cloth and Kent’s spine and\nfront cover designs produced what were perhaps the handsomest volumes\nthe Modern Library ever published. Unfortunately, Kent’s design appears\nto have been overly ambitious for books that retailed at ninety-five\ncents. The extra gold it required increased the Modern Library’s binding\ncosts by half a cent per copy. That half cent doomed the design, and it\nwas used in its complete form for less than two years.\n\nThe balloon cloth bindings were available in four colors: red, blue,\ngreen, and brown. The Modern Library published each title simultaneously\nin all four bindings.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nTwo endpaper designs were used in 1929. Lucian Bernhard’s endpaper\nprinted in light yellowish brown remained in use through March. A new\nendpaper designed by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April in\nconjunction with his new binding. Copies of the first printing of\nThornton Wilder, *The Cabala* (175), which was published in April but\nprobably printed in March, exist with both endpapers. The paste-down and\nfree endpapers both featured Kent’s torchbearer at the center,\nsurrounded by a pattern of open books and the initials “ml”. The\nconjunct endpapers were identical except that the two torchbearers faced\neach other. For the first year Kent’s endpapers were available in four\ndifferent colors—light grayish red (18), dark yellowish pink (30), light\nreddish brown (42), and pale green (149)—and were color coordinated with\nthe balloon cloth bindings. Red bindings had light grayish red\nendpapers, blue and green bindings had pale green endpapers, and brown\nbindings had dark yellowish pink or light reddish brown endpapers.\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were printed in moderate\norange (53) and were used with all four binding colors. Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the\nWorld* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the\nlarger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that\nfall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper, with the central panels\nwith Kent’s torchbearer unchanged but with the surrounding pattern of\nopen books and the initials “ml” extended to fill the larger space, was\nintroduced in spring 1940.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll 1929 titles except *The Memoirs of Casanova* (185) were originally\npublished in uniform typographic jacket D. The Casanova jacket has an\ninset illustration of Casanova in left profile holding a candlestick in\none hand and opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle\ncasts a shadow of a satyr on the door. *The Memoirs of Casanova* appears\nto be the first ML title to have been published initially in a pictorial\njacket without the option of a uniform typographic jacket.\n\nAn unknown number of ML titles were available in optional pictorial\njackets as well as the uniform typographic jacket.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n*Dating keys:* (Spring) Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* xChaucer,\n*Canterbury Tales*. (Fall) Chaucer, *Canterbury Tales* xHemingway, *Sun\nAlso Rises*.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nErich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel *All Quiet on the Western Front*,\nwith sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929\nbest-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of\n$5,000 to $10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in\nthe ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre,\nLittle, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of *All Quiet on the\nWestern Front* was published by Grosset & Dunlap, which distributed its\nhardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast,\nML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and\nthe book departments of major department stores.\n\nIn another long shot, Cerf offered a $6,000 advance against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to\nLowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his\ncopyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive\nreprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s\ndeath, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.\n\nCerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford’s novel *The Honorable\nPeter Stirling*, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset\n& Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book\n(Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley\nanthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11\nDecember 1929).\n\nHendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, *Tolerance* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1925), noting that it was “the sort of book to appeal to the\nfree-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor”\n(Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press\nsuggested André Tridon’s *Psychoanalysis*, originally published by B. W.\nHuebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both\nsuggestions were rejected.\n\nSeveral months after Edmond Rostand’s *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174)\nappeared in the ML, Duffield & Co. inquired if the ML would be\ninterested in Rostand’s later play *Chantecler* or Paul Verlaines’s\n*Poems*. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in *The\nHistory of Mr. Polly* by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24\nOctober 1929).\n\nAlbert Mordell sent his book, *The Erotic Motive in Literature* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no\nplace in the ML because its “appeal is special, and many statements that\nwould have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today” (Cerf to\nMordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell’s book revived in the\n1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier\nBooks and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several\ntranslations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and\nthe first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\n**Christmas gift boxes**\n\nThe ML produced three Christmas gift boxes in 1929. Each set consisted\nof three ML titles in a slipcase. The books had specially designed\npictorial jackets and were advertised as “specially boxed and bound in\ngay colors, with picture jackets” (ML ad, *PW* 116, 21 September 1929,\np. 1265). *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Modern Novels*\nwere new; *Three Great Renaissance Romances* was first offered as a\nChristmas gift box in 1928. The Keratol bindings used in 1928 were\nreplaced by colored balloon cloth which the ML had introduced as its\nstandard binding earlier in the year. The pictorial jackets used for\n*Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Renaissance Romances*\nwere later adapted for use on regular ML printings. Hynd’s pictorial\njackets for the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box were exceptional\nexamples of expressionist graphics but may have been too edgy for the\nML’s mainstream audience. Their use was limited to the 1929 gift box;\nthey were never adapted for use on copies of the books sold separately.\nThe retail price of each set was $2.85. The 1929 gift boxes were the\nlast, though unsold boxes continued to be listed in ML catalogs. The\nthree sets were:\n\n1\\. *Three Great French Romances*: Zola, *Nana*; Gautier, *Mademoiselle\nde Maupin*; Flaubert, *Madame Bovary*.\n\n2\\. *Three Great Renaissance Romances:* Cellini, *Autobiography*;\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*; Symonds, *Life of\nMichelangelo*.\n\n3\\. *Three Great Modern Novels*: Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*;\nButler, *Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *Return of the Native*.\n\n### New titles\n\nAiken, ed., *American Poetry 1671–1928* (1929–1944); *A Comprehensive\nAnthology of American Poetry* (1945) 169\n\nFlaubert, *Salammbô* (1929) 170\n\nDostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (1929) 171\n\nMurphy, ed., *Outline of Abnormal Psychology* (1929–1954); 172; Murphy\nand Bachrach, eds., *Outline of Abnormal Psychology*, rev. ed.

Discontinued 1978/79. *Note:* The copyright date is 1944,\nbut publication of *A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry* appears\nto have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper\nshortages.\n\n*A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* also comprised the\nAmerican portion of the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and\nAmerican Poetry* (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s\ninsistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra\nPound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was\nlater returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf\nignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve\nomitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been\n“overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include\na single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was\nfocused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any\nsuggestion of purging Pound from *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* or *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (137.2), both of which\nwere published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s\npoems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the\n1947 printing (see G68).\n\nSince the regular ML edition of *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from\ndifferent type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two\nformats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of\nthe two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of\nthe Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books\nare printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point\nsize. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the\nheadline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type\npages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the\nGiant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page,\nbut there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the\nregular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries,\nindexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular\nedition and 420 pages in the Giant.\n\n*American Poetry 1671*–*1928* and *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee\nCullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American\npoet. These and other African American poets had been represented in *An\nAnthology of American Negro Literature* (183), edited by V. F. Calverton\nand published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s\nanthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time *A\nComprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* appeared in 1945. The\nrevised edition of *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (372),\nedited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and\n1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies”\nedited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice\nM. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of\nCalverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have\noccurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets\nfrom his anthology.\n\n#### 169.2b.

Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to\nme much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much\ntoo much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo.\nAnd what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story”\n(Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to\nDurant, 10 September 1928). Durant indicated that he didn’t have time to\nmake changes, and the ML published *Salammbô* without an introduction.\n\nFour years after *Salammbô* was discontinued, James T. Farrell suggested\nFlaubert’s *Sentimental* *Education* for the ML (Farrell to Cerf, 1\nFebruary 1939). Cerf responded, “I am sorry to say that I see little\npoint in adding another Flaubert title to the Modern Library at this\ntime. We had to drop out both SALAMMBO and THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY\nbecause of complete lack of demand, and even MADAME BOVARY doesn’t sell\none-quarter of what it did ten and fifteen years ago” (Cerf to Farrell,\n2 February 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nFlaubert, *Madame Bovary* (1917– ) 25\n\nFlaubert, *Temptation of St. Anthony* (1921–1933) 82\n\n### 171\n\n**FYODOR DOSTOYEVSKY.

Copies of the first printing are also found in\nballoon cloth binding with Kent’s grapevine design on the spine, his\ntorchbearer in gold on the front panel, and the title and author on the\nspine stamped from lettering drawn by hand rather than set from metal\ntype. There is also an intermediate stage between binding A and binding\nB1 which incorporates all elements of Kent’s design except hand\nlettering on the spine.

Brett,\nJr., Macmillan, 31 October 1928; Harold S. Latham, Macmillan, to\nKlopfer, 9 November 1928). Cerf and Klopfer decided to assume the cost\nof original composition and announced that the ML edition was the first\nto be printed in the United States. Other publishers, they noted,\n“always imported it from England rather than undergo the great expense\nof making a new set of plates for so lengthy a book” (ML circular, RH\nbox 133, Advertising 1929 folder 2). At 988 pages *The Brothers\nKaramazov* was longest book the ML had published up to that time.\n\n*The Brothers Karamazov* sold about 30,000 copies in its first\ntwo-and-a-half years in the ML (Cerf to Robert Linscott, 9 October\n1931). It ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943.

He indicated that he had recently reviewed\nthe selections in the 1929 edition and that in almost every instance it\nwould be possible to select a superior example to represent current\nresearch and practice. He noted that he would need a collaborator who\nwas familiar with fields in which he was not up-to-date (Murphy to Cerf,\n14 January 1953).\n\nStein replied four months later that the ML was planning revisions of\nseveral titles, including *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology*. He\nsuggested that Murphy engage a collaborator for a flat fee of $300,\nwhich would be paid as an advance against Murphy’s royalties, and\nindicated that the ML would pay up to $300 for permissions. The royalty\nrate was to remain at 5 cents a copy (Stein to Murphy, 15 May 1953).\nMurphy thought that $500 should be the minimum fee for a collaborator\nbut believed that permissions would be less than $300. Stein agreed to\nthe $500 collaborator’s fee and reduced the permissions budget to $200\n(Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953; Stein to Murphy, 29 May 1953). Murphy\nselected Bachrach as his collaborator. Bachrach made the preliminary\nselection of contents, and Murphy wrote a new introduction. The revised\nedition contained completely new material.\n\nThe American Institute of Graphic Arts selected *An Outline of Abnormal\nPsychology* as one of the fifty best books of 1954 (*Fifty Books of the\nYear 1954: Catalog of the Thirty-third Annual Exhibition* \\[New York:\nAmerican Institute of Graphic Arts, 1955\\], p. 34).

All the fine bravura of\n> Edmond Rostand’s swaggering drama, all its poetical extravagance and\n> glamor are here in Brian Hooker’s famous translation. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nHooker translation originally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1923. ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March\n1929. *WR* 27 April 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1973/74.\n\nThe Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the\ntext and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of\n10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new\nplates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first\n30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a $3,400 advance in December 1928\nagainst royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.\n\nIn 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of *Cyrano de\nBergerac* at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the\npresident of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed\nconcern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but\nhe acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely\nputting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your\nmind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at\nhigh schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have\nproposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on\nyour own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18\nJune 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).\n\n*Cyrano de Bergerac* ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during\nthe 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth\nbest-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October\n1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose\nFerrer.\n\n#### 174.1b.

He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is\nsuperb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though\na perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was\ninherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider\nchanging the translation, which had “established itself as standard for\nmany college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953;\nCommins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton\nUniversity Library). Le Clercq’s translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac*\ndoes not appear to have been published.\n\nBy 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML\nedition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep *Cyrano* in\nthe series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt\naccept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new\nplates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time\nHolt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C.\nEdwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May\n1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the\nmid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.\n\n### 175\n\n***THORNTON WILDER. THE CABALA. 1929–1937.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Albert & Charles Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[iii\\], \\[3\\]–230) printed from Boni plates. The heading of the\ncontents page of Boni printings was changed from *The Cabala* to\n*Contents* at some point between the sixth printing (January 1928) and\nthe tenth printing (August 1928); ML printings use the second version of\nthe contents page. Published April 1929. *WR* 11 May 1929. First\nprinting: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1937.\n\nCerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know\nthat you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote,\n“particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an\nintroduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to\nsend it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is\ngoing to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford\nto buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be\nmade up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words\nstating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in\nthis edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double\nthe ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the\nlast moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an\nintroduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March\n1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the\nend of March.\n\n*The Cabala* sold well during its first two or three years in the\nseries. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and\nanother printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in\nthe RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933.\n\n### 176\n\n***PETRONIUS. THE SATYRICON. 1929–1957. (ML 156)**\n\n#### 176a.

It is the story of Julien\n> Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose\n> prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless\n> egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the\n> calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent\n> Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are\n> intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The\n> contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict\n> between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp\n> in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois\n> mores and French society, *The Red and the Black* established Stendhal\n> as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.\n\nPublished fall 1984 at $9.95.

Knopf, his American\npublisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached\nKnopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He\ntold Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an\nintroduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s\nusual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf\nto Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that *Humphry Clinker*, “the\nwork of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he\nthought that *Roderick Random* was “more characteristically Smollett:\nrough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin\nwith. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with\nhis order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April\n1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he\nwrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.\n\n*Humphry Clinker* ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943.

Her life was consecrated to love. As it was with Shulamite,\nwho inspired Solomon’s Song of Songs, so love had set a seal upon\nLilly’s heart. All the denials of poverty, the violences of lechery and\nthe longings of her own dream world only made her more desirable in the\neyes of men. Hermann Sudermann’s novel of a woman who walked in sin is a\nromance in the cause of love beyond purity. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nSeltzer translation originally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1909, and\nafter 1925 by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. \\[3\\]–640) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title.\nPublished October 1929. *WR* 23 November 1929. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1942.\n\nML printings do not identify the translator. Huebsch and Viking\nprintings attribute the translation to Thomas Seltzer, but it was\nactually by his wife Adele Seltzer, who wanted to publicize her\nhusband’s name. Thomas Seltzer’s contribution was typing the manuscript\nthat was submitted to Huebsch (Levin, *Dare to Be Different*, pp. 85,\n269).\n\nThe ML paid Viking royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were three\nadditional printings of 2,000 copies each between April 1930 and April\n1931 and five known printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1932\nand April 1941.\n\nSudermann’s novel was read more widely in the early decades of the 20th\ncentury than it is today. Jackets of early ML printings of *Madame\nBovary* (25.1) state on the front panel: “Today there are two more\nnovels that are likely to be classed with \\[*Madame Bovary*\\] . . .\nTolstoy’s ‘Anna Karenina’ and Sudermann’s ‘Song of Songs.’” (see 25.1a).\n\n#### 182b.

Handy authorized the inclusion of five blues he had\ncopyrighted, he stipulated that copyright notices were to be printed on\nthe same pages as the lyrics. Calverton acknowledged Handy generously in\nthe preface but neglected to include the individual copyright notices.\nHandy or his representative contacted the ML shortly after publication,\ninsisting that the agreement be honored. Klopfer contacted the ML’s\nlegal counsel about the matter (Klopfer to Edwin A. Falk, 27 November\n1929). He subsequently wrote to H. Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders,\ninforming them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected\nsheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s\ntruckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s\nstock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,”\nhe stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly\nprinted” (Klopfer to Miss J. A. Lanning, H. Wolff Estate, 26 December\n1929).

At\nthis time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering\nresentment over the ML edition of *Green Mansions* (90). However, Cerf\nhad become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying\nto put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928).\nRelations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929\nluncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a $1,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy for *Peter Whiffle*. He also\noffered to pay Van Vechten $100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an\nintroduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated\nthat he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van\nVechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf\nturned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929). *Peter\nWhiffle* was the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the\nML.\n\nThere was a second printing of 1,000 copies in August 1932.\n\n### 185\n\n***JACQUES CASANOVA.

By that time the ML had begun\ncomposition so that the books could be published in December.\n\n*The Iliad* ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles\nduring the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and rose into the lower\npart of the first quarter during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952.

Richmond Lattimore’s verse translation of *The Odyssey* did\nnot appear until 1967, sixteen years after his translation of *The\nIliad*. The Lattimore translation probably would not have been available\nto the ML in any case. Rees’s verse translation of *The Iliad* was\npublished in 1963 and was added to the ML the following year (see\n186.2).

  "year": "1929",
  "general": "With a few exceptions such as Villon, *Poems* (55) and *Passages from\nthe Diary of Samuel Pepys* (89), the Boni & Liveright series remained\ntrue to its name and limited its scope to modern works. Cerf and Klopfer\nincreased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added\nDefoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto\nCellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928\nwhen Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and\nRabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles\npublished in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156),\nSmollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury\nTales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of\nthese works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York\nSociety for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them\nin the eyes of the shallowest modernist.\n\nCerf and Klopfer were interested in publishing older classics besides\nthose that appealed specifically to modernist readers, but they\nquestioned whether the Modern Library was the appropriate vehicle for\nthem. Responding to a list of suggestions for the ML in 1928, Klopfer\ncommented, “The one that intrigues me most is the ‘Selected Poems of\nJohn Donne’, although I am not sure that he would fit into the *Modern*\nLibrary” (Klopfer to John W. Gassner, 22 March 1928).\n\nFor a time they contemplated starting a separate series of older\nclassics along the lines of Everyman’s Library. They scoured the lists\nof Everyman’s Library, Loeb Classical Library, and the “100 Best Books”\nfor potential titles. The lists they compiled consisted mainly of\nstandard works of classical and English literature, together with those\nof the Renaissance and, to a lesser extent, French literature. After\nconsidering various names for the series, they seem to have settled\ntentatively on the name Seven Seas Library; that at least is the name\nthat appears most often in penciled memos from this period. Other names\nincluded Phoenix Library, Salamander Library, Pantheon Library, Mercury\nLibrary, and Random House Classics.\n\nAnother possibility they considered was taking over an existing series\nof standard classics. In 1929 Cerf wrote to J. M. Dent & Co., the\nEnglish publishers of Everyman’s Library, offering to distribute the\nseries in the United States. American distribution of the series had\nbeen handled since its inception by E. P. Dutton Co. The relationship\nbetween the two firms was very close, and Dent had no interest in\nchanging American distribution of the series (Cerf to Hugh R. Dent, 12\nDecember 1929; Dent to Cerf, 1 January 1930). Cerf’s inquiry may have\ncontributed to the soured relations between Dutton and the Modern\nLibrary that persisted for many years.\n\nIn the end Cerf and Klopfer decided not to start a separate series of\nolder classics. Many of the works listed as potential titles for the\nSeven Seas Library eventually found their way into the Modern Library.\n\nAnother change in scope was that the Modern Library gradually lost its\nEuropean orientation and became a series with neither European nor\nAmerican authors seemingly outweighing the other. Signs of increased\ninterest in American authors appeared soon after Cerf and Klopfer bought\nthe series. A 1926 advertisement featuring photographs of Modern Library\nauthors showed four Americans—Walt Whitman, Sherwood Anderson, James\nBranch Cabell, and Eugene O’Neill—and one European, Anatole France (ML\nadvertisement, *New York Herald Tribune Books*, 7 November 1926). The\nModern Library catalogue for 1927, announcing publication of *The\nScarlet Letter*, stated: “The addition of this splendid novel is\nconsistent with the avowed intention of the publishers to include in the\nModern Library as many American authors as possible” (ML catalogue,\nSpring-Summer 1927).\n\nAmerican authors were added regularly to the ML after 1925. No year went\nby without the publication of works by Americans, but the balance was\nnot tipped suddenly in their favor. Of the twelve titles published in\n1926, three were by Americans: Anderson, *Poor White* (121), Melville,\n*Moby-Dick* (124), and Lewisohn, *Up Stream* (128). The greatest\nconcentration of Americans added to the series before 1930 came in 1927,\nwhen six out of nineteen new titles were by American authors.\n\nAs with the inclusion of older classics, the new emphasis on American\nworks did not become abundantly clear until the 1930s. The stock market\ncrash of October 1929 ended seven years of prosperity, but the ML\nentered the Depression in a strong position. As Cerf wrote in 1929, “The\nModern Library is no longer an experiment; it has become an institution\nin the book world. . . . These ubiquitous books . . . at one time or\nanother have penetrated into nearly every American home and into the\nlibraries of many readers in other countries” (“The Modern Library,”\n*Publishers’ Weekly*, 9 February 1929, p. 657; published anonymously but\nwritten by Cerf).",
  "numberOfTitles": "Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen titles, bringing the total number of\nactive titles to 167. No titles were discontinued. Minor discrepancies\nbetween the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML\njackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles\nprojected for January publication on fall lists.\n\n**Format and printing**\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).",
  "titlePage": "All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and the last line of the title page as\nPUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Adler’s title\npage was used with two different torchbearers. The six titles published\nJanuary–March had torchbearer B; the thirteen titles published\nApril-December reverted to Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2.",
  "binding": "The imitation leather bindings used since 1917 had never been altogether\nsatisfactory. Castor oil used in manufacturing the imitation leather\ncaused the bindings to emit a fishy odor in warm weather. Cerf and\nKlopfer began to think seriously about abandoning the imitation leather\nbindings in 1928. After experimenting with various binding cloths, they\ndiscovered a natural finish balloon cloth manufactured by the Siegbert\nBook Cloth Corporation that seemed to meet their requirements. They\nprepared samples of the new binding, with semi-flexible covers, and\nshowed them to several leading booksellers and department store buyers.\nThe response was favorable, and they decided to go ahead.\n\nThe balloon cloth binding was officially introduced with the Modern\nLibrary’s January 1929 publications, Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry\n1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology* (169) and Gustave Flaubert’s\n*Salammbô* (170). The old spine and cover design continued to be used\nthrough March, but this was a temporary expedient. Shortly after they\ndecided to substitute balloon cloth for imitation leather, Cerf and\nKlopfer asked Rockwell Kent, who had created the Random House device in\n1927, to make a “simple . . . but characteristic Kentian design for the\nback-strip” (Cerf to Kent, 11 December 1928). Kent more than fulfilled\nhis commission. He not only drew a striking new spine for Modern Library\nbook, but redesigned the torchbearer and created new endpapers as well.\n\nKent began with the idea of putting the torchbearer at the base of the\nspine, but decided that the figure was too attenuated for the space\navailable. Still, he felt that the torch idea should be kept and wanted\nto use a sizable spot of gold to make the spine distinctive. His first\nsolution was a design incorporating a candle. To Klopfer he wrote:\n\n> After, I assure you, making more designs for that book-back than there\n> are published works in the Modern Library; after considering and\n> rejecting innumerable pictorial designs, nudes, phallic symbols, and\n> so forth, as either inappropriate to book covers or indigestible to\n> middle western and New England patrons of your publications; I have\n> conceived and executed the somewhat trite, but I feel appropriate,\n> device which I enclose, and if you feel that in employing a candle as\n> part of it I have gone as far in suggestion as may be permitted,\n> please realize that I have shown some restraint in not making that\n> candle of the horrid dipped variety, so much in vogue in modern days\n> (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929).\n\nThe candle was never used. Cerf had warned Kent that the balloon cloth\nwould not take readily every kind of design, and the candle may have\nbeen too detailed to be stamped clearly. At that point Kent decided that\nnothing could be done with the original design and discarded it.\n\nThree weeks later he sent in an entirely new design. The new design, he\nnoted, “should not only work out better in stamping but . . . in every\nway pleases me more” (Kent to Klopfer, 16 February 1929). Intended for\nthe base of the spine, it consisted of an elegantly styled grape vine\nwith intertwined branches, leaves, and bunches of grapes. Beneath the\nroots of the vine the words “Modern Library” were lettered in sans-serif\ncapitals. Kent recommended that the lettering for the title and author\nat the head of the spine be drawn by hand. “You can get much more\nsatisfactory spacing in that way,” he wrote. “There are innumerable\nprofessional letterers, any of whom can do this every month for you,\npromptly and at little cost” (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929). The ML\ndoes not appear to have adopted this suggestion.\n\nFor the front cover of the binding Kent redrew Bernhard’s torchbearer.\nHe thought Bernhard’s figure was “good in design, but too grotesque to\nbe in keeping with the serious nature of the Modern Library.” Kent drew\na more graceful, floating figure, with the torch, instead of being held\naloft, carried in front of the runner with the flare trailing over the\nrunner’s head. He omitted the words “Modern Library” which had encircled\nBernhard’s figure on the grounds that it was sufficient to have them on\nthe spine. He also made two other changes in the figure. Bernhard’s\nfigure faced left, toward the spine. Kent thought this a violation of\ncommon sense and precedent in book design and turned it around. He also\naltered its sex. Bernhard’s figure was assumed to be feminine; around\nthe Modern Library office it was known as “a dame running away from\nBennett Cerf.” Kent made his version neuter. “I defy you to discover the\nfigure’s sex,” he told Klopfer. “That’s modern enough for you” (ibid).\n\nKent’s binding design was introduced with *The Cabala* by Thornton\nWilder, the Modern Library’s April 1929 title. Bernhard’s torchbearer\nwas not completely superseded by Kent’s figure. It never again appeared\non the binding or endpaper, but it continued to be used on Modern\nLibrary title pages and on many of the jackets.\n\nKent’s work for the Modern Library was a remarkable achievement in book\ndesign. The combination of smooth balloon cloth and Kent’s spine and\nfront cover designs produced what were perhaps the handsomest volumes\nthe Modern Library ever published. Unfortunately, Kent’s design appears\nto have been overly ambitious for books that retailed at ninety-five\ncents. The extra gold it required increased the Modern Library’s binding\ncosts by half a cent per copy. That half cent doomed the design, and it\nwas used in its complete form for less than two years.\n\nThe balloon cloth bindings were available in four colors: red, blue,\ngreen, and brown. The Modern Library published each title simultaneously\nin all four bindings.",
  "endpaper": "Two endpaper designs were used in 1929. Lucian Bernhard’s endpaper\nprinted in light yellowish brown remained in use through March. A new\nendpaper designed by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April in\nconjunction with his new binding. Copies of the first printing of\nThornton Wilder, *The Cabala* (175), which was published in April but\nprobably printed in March, exist with both endpapers. The paste-down and\nfree endpapers both featured Kent’s torchbearer at the center,\nsurrounded by a pattern of open books and the initials “ml”. The\nconjunct endpapers were identical except that the two torchbearers faced\neach other. For the first year Kent’s endpapers were available in four\ndifferent colors—light grayish red (18), dark yellowish pink (30), light\nreddish brown (42), and pale green (149)—and were color coordinated with\nthe balloon cloth bindings. Red bindings had light grayish red\nendpapers, blue and green bindings had pale green endpapers, and brown\nbindings had dark yellowish pink or light reddish brown endpapers.\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were printed in moderate\norange (53) and were used with all four binding colors. Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the\nWorld* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the\nlarger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that\nfall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper, with the central panels\nwith Kent’s torchbearer unchanged but with the surrounding pattern of\nopen books and the initials “ml” extended to fill the larger space, was\nintroduced in spring 1940.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll 1929 titles except *The Memoirs of Casanova* (185) were originally\npublished in uniform typographic jacket D. The Casanova jacket has an\ninset illustration of Casanova in left profile holding a candlestick in\none hand and opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle\ncasts a shadow of a satyr on the door. *The Memoirs of Casanova* appears\nto be the first ML title to have been published initially in a pictorial\njacket without the option of a uniform typographic jacket.\n\nAn unknown number of ML titles were available in optional pictorial\njackets as well as the uniform typographic jacket.",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel *All Quiet on the Western Front*,\nwith sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929\nbest-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of\n$5,000 to $10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in\nthe ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre,\nLittle, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of *All Quiet on the\nWestern Front* was published by Grosset & Dunlap, which distributed its\nhardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast,\nML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and\nthe book departments of major department stores.\n\nIn another long shot, Cerf offered a $6,000 advance against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to\nLowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his\ncopyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive\nreprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s\ndeath, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.\n\nCerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford’s novel *The Honorable\nPeter Stirling*, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset\n& Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book\n(Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley\nanthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11\nDecember 1929).\n\nHendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, *Tolerance* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1925), noting that it was “the sort of book to appeal to the\nfree-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor”\n(Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press\nsuggested André Tridon’s *Psychoanalysis*, originally published by B. W.\nHuebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both\nsuggestions were rejected.\n\nSeveral months after Edmond Rostand’s *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174)\nappeared in the ML, Duffield & Co. inquired if the ML would be\ninterested in Rostand’s later play *Chantecler* or Paul Verlaines’s\n*Poems*. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in *The\nHistory of Mr. Polly* by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24\nOctober 1929).\n\nAlbert Mordell sent his book, *The Erotic Motive in Literature* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no\nplace in the ML because its “appeal is special, and many statements that\nwould have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today” (Cerf to\nMordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell’s book revived in the\n1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier\nBooks and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several\ntranslations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and\nthe first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\n**Christmas gift boxes**\n\nThe ML produced three Christmas gift boxes in 1929. Each set consisted\nof three ML titles in a slipcase. The books had specially designed\npictorial jackets and were advertised as “specially boxed and bound in\ngay colors, with picture jackets” (ML ad, *PW* 116, 21 September 1929,\np. 1265). *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Modern Novels*\nwere new; *Three Great Renaissance Romances* was first offered as a\nChristmas gift box in 1928. The Keratol bindings used in 1928 were\nreplaced by colored balloon cloth which the ML had introduced as its\nstandard binding earlier in the year. The pictorial jackets used for\n*Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Renaissance Romances*\nwere later adapted for use on regular ML printings. Hynd’s pictorial\njackets for the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box were exceptional\nexamples of expressionist graphics but may have been too edgy for the\nML’s mainstream audience. Their use was limited to the 1929 gift box;\nthey were never adapted for use on copies of the books sold separately.\nThe retail price of each set was $2.85. The 1929 gift boxes were the\nlast, though unsold boxes continued to be listed in ML catalogs. The\nthree sets were:\n\n1\\. *Three Great French Romances*: Zola, *Nana*; Gautier, *Mademoiselle\nde Maupin*; Flaubert, *Madame Bovary*.\n\n2\\. *Three Great Renaissance Romances:* Cellini, *Autobiography*;\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*; Symonds, *Life of\nMichelangelo*.\n\n3\\. *Three Great Modern Novels*: Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*;\nButler, *Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *Return of the Native*.",

He indicated that he had recently reviewed\nthe selections in the 1929 edition and that in almost every instance it\nwould be possible to select a superior example to represent current\nresearch and practice. He noted that he would need a collaborator who\nwas familiar with fields in which he was not up-to-date (Murphy to Cerf,\n14 January 1953).\n\nStein replied four months later that the ML was planning revisions of\nseveral titles, including *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology*. He\nsuggested that Murphy engage a collaborator for a flat fee of $300,\nwhich would be paid as an advance against Murphy’s royalties, and\nindicated that the ML would pay up to $300 for permissions. The royalty\nrate was to remain at 5 cents a copy (Stein to Murphy, 15 May 1953).\nMurphy thought that $500 should be the minimum fee for a collaborator\nbut believed that permissions would be less than $300. Stein agreed to\nthe $500 collaborator’s fee and reduced the permissions budget to $200\n(Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953; Stein to Murphy, 29 May 1953). Murphy\nselected Bachrach as his collaborator. Bachrach made the preliminary\nselection of contents, and Murphy wrote a new introduction. The revised\nedition contained completely new material.\n\nThe American Institute of Graphic Arts selected *An Outline of Abnormal\nPsychology* as one of the fifty best books of 1954 (*Fifty Books of the\nYear 1954: Catalog of the Thirty-third Annual Exhibition* \\[New York:\nAmerican Institute of Graphic Arts, 1955\\], p. 34).

Discontinued 1978/79. *Note:* The copyright date is 1944,\nbut publication of *A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry* appears\nto have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper\nshortages.\n\n*A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* also comprised the\nAmerican portion of the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and\nAmerican Poetry* (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s\ninsistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra\nPound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was\nlater returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf\nignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve\nomitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been\n“overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include\na single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was\nfocused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any\nsuggestion of purging Pound from *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* or *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (137.2), both of which\nwere published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s\npoems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the\n1947 printing (see G68).\n\nSince the regular ML edition of *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from\ndifferent type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two\nformats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of\nthe two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of\nthe Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books\nare printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point\nsize. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the\nheadline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type\npages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the\nGiant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page,\nbut there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the\nregular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries,\nindexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular\nedition and 420 pages in the Giant.\n\n*American Poetry 1671*–*1928* and *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee\nCullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American\npoet. These and other African American poets had been represented in *An\nAnthology of American Negro Literature* (183), edited by V. F. Calverton\nand published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s\nanthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time *A\nComprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* appeared in 1945. The\nrevised edition of *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (372),\nedited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and\n1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies”\nedited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice\nM. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of\nCalverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have\noccurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets\nfrom his anthology.\n\n#### 169.2b.

Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to\nme much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much\ntoo much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo.\nAnd what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story”\n(Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to\nDurant, 10 September 1928). Durant indicated that he didn’t have time to\nmake changes, and the ML published *Salammbô* without an introduction.\n\nFour years after *Salammbô* was discontinued, James T. Farrell suggested\nFlaubert’s *Sentimental* *Education* for the ML (Farrell to Cerf, 1\nFebruary 1939). Cerf responded, “I am sorry to say that I see little\npoint in adding another Flaubert title to the Modern Library at this\ntime. We had to drop out both SALAMMBO and THE TEMPTATION OF ST.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1973/74.\n\nThe Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the\ntext and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of\n10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new\nplates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first\n30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a $3,400 advance in December 1928\nagainst royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.\n\nIn 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of *Cyrano de\nBergerac* at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the\npresident of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed\nconcern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but\nhe acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely\nputting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your\nmind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at\nhigh schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have\nproposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on\nyour own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18\nJune 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).\n\n*Cyrano de Bergerac* ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during\nthe 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth\nbest-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October\n1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose\nFerrer.\n\n#### 174.1b.

He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is\nsuperb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though\na perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was\ninherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider\nchanging the translation, which had “established itself as standard for\nmany college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953;\nCommins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton\nUniversity Library). Le Clercq’s translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac*\ndoes not appear to have been published.\n\nBy 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML\nedition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep *Cyrano* in\nthe series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt\naccept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new\nplates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time\nHolt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C.\nEdwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May\n1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the\nmid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy."

In particular this new audience will be\nmade up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words\nstating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in\nthis edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double\nthe ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the\nlast moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an\nintroduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March\n1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the\nend of March.\n\n*The Cabala* sold well during its first two or three years in the\nseries. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and\nanother printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in\nthe RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933."

It is the story of Julien\n> Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose\n> prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless\n> egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the\n> calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent\n> Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are\n> intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The\n> contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict\n> between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp\n> in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois\n> mores and French society, *The Red and the Black* established Stendhal\n> as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.\n\nPublished fall 1984 at $9.95.

Knopf, his American\npublisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached\nKnopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He\ntold Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an\nintroduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s\nusual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf\nto Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that *Humphry Clinker*, “the\nwork of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he\nthought that *Roderick Random* was “more characteristically Smollett:\nrough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin\nwith. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with\nhis order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April\n1927).

Her life was consecrated to love. As it was with Shulamite,\nwho inspired Solomon’s Song of Songs, so love had set a seal upon\nLilly’s heart. All the denials of poverty, the violences of lechery and\nthe longings of her own dream world only made her more desirable in the\neyes of men. Hermann Sudermann’s novel of a woman who walked in sin is a\nromance in the cause of love beyond purity. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nSeltzer translation originally published by B. W.

He asked that the bindery’s\ntruckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s\nstock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,”\nhe stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly\nprinted” (Klopfer to Miss J. A.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1929 1929 With a few exceptions such as Villon, *Poems* (55) and *Passages from\nthe Diary of Samuel Pepys* (89), the Boni & Liveright series remained\ntrue to its name and limited its scope to modern works. Cerf and Klopfer\nincreased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added\nDefoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto\nCellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928\nwhen Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and\nRabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles\npublished in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156),\nSmollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury\nTales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of\nthese works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York\nSociety for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them\nin the eyes of the shallowest modernist.\n\nCerf and Klopfer were interested in publishing older classics besides\nthose that appealed specifically to modernist readers, but they\nquestioned whether the Modern Library was the appropriate vehicle for\nthem. Responding to a list of suggestions for the ML in 1928, Klopfer\ncommented, “The one that intrigues me most is the ‘Selected Poems of\nJohn Donne’, although I am not sure that he would fit into the *Modern*\nLibrary” (Klopfer to John W. Gassner, 22 March 1928).\n\nFor a time they contemplated starting a separate series of older\nclassics along the lines of Everyman’s Library. They scoured the lists\nof Everyman’s Library, Loeb Classical Library, and the “100 Best Books”\nfor potential titles. The lists they compiled consisted mainly of\nstandard works of classical and English literature, together with those\nof the Renaissance and, to a lesser extent, French literature. After\nconsidering various names for the series, they seem to have settled\ntentatively on the name Seven Seas Library; that at least is the name\nthat appears most often in penciled memos from this period. Other names\nincluded Phoenix Library, Salamander Library, Pantheon Library, Mercury\nLibrary, and Random House Classics.\n\nAnother possibility they considered was taking over an existing series\nof standard classics. In 1929 Cerf wrote to J. M. Dent & Co., the\nEnglish publishers of Everyman’s Library, offering to distribute the\nseries in the United States. American distribution of the series had\nbeen handled since its inception by E. P. Dutton Co. The relationship\nbetween the two firms was very close, and Dent had no interest in\nchanging American distribution of the series (Cerf to Hugh R. Dent, 12\nDecember 1929; Dent to Cerf, 1 January 1930). Cerf’s inquiry may have\ncontributed to the soured relations between Dutton and the Modern\nLibrary that persisted for many years.\n\nIn the end Cerf and Klopfer decided not to start a separate series of\nolder classics. Many of the works listed as potential titles for the\nSeven Seas Library eventually found their way into the Modern Library.\n\nAnother change in scope was that the Modern Library gradually lost its\nEuropean orientation and became a series with neither European nor\nAmerican authors seemingly outweighing the other. Signs of increased\ninterest in American authors appeared soon after Cerf and Klopfer bought\nthe series. A 1926 advertisement featuring photographs of Modern Library\nauthors showed four Americans—Walt Whitman, Sherwood Anderson, James\nBranch Cabell, and Eugene O’Neill—and one European, Anatole France (ML\nadvertisement, *New York Herald Tribune Books*, 7 November 1926). The\nModern Library catalogue for 1927, announcing publication of *The\nScarlet Letter*, stated: “The addition of this splendid novel is\nconsistent with the avowed intention of the publishers to include in the\nModern Library as many American authors as possible” (ML catalogue,\nSpring-Summer 1927).\n\nAmerican authors were added regularly to the ML after 1925. No year went\nby without the publication of works by Americans, but the balance was\nnot tipped suddenly in their favor. Of the twelve titles published in\n1926, three were by Americans: Anderson, *Poor White* (121), Melville,\n*Moby-Dick* (124), and Lewisohn, *Up Stream* (128). The greatest\nconcentration of Americans added to the series before 1930 came in 1927,\nwhen six out of nineteen new titles were by American authors.\n\nAs with the inclusion of older classics, the new emphasis on American\nworks did not become abundantly clear until the 1930s. The stock market\ncrash of October 1929 ended seven years of prosperity, but the ML\nentered the Depression in a strong position. As Cerf wrote in 1929, “The\nModern Library is no longer an experiment; it has become an institution\nin the book world. . . . These ubiquitous books . . . at one time or\nanother have penetrated into nearly every American home and into the\nlibraries of many readers in other countries” (“The Modern Library,”\n*Publishers’ Weekly*, 9 February 1929, p. 657; published anonymously but\nwritten by Cerf). Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen titles, bringing the total number of\nactive titles to 167. No titles were discontinued. Minor discrepancies\nbetween the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML\njackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles\nprojected for January publication on fall lists.\n\n**Format and printing**\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard format with the binding\nmeasuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼\nin. (164 x 107 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and the last line of the title page as\nPUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Adler’s title\npage was used with two different torchbearers. The six titles published\nJanuary–March had torchbearer B; the thirteen titles published\nApril-December reverted to Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2. The imitation leather bindings used since 1917 had never been altogether\nsatisfactory. Castor oil used in manufacturing the imitation leather\ncaused the bindings to emit a fishy odor in warm weather. Cerf and\nKlopfer began to think seriously about abandoning the imitation leather\nbindings in 1928. After experimenting with various binding cloths, they\ndiscovered a natural finish balloon cloth manufactured by the Siegbert\nBook Cloth Corporation that seemed to meet their requirements. They\nprepared samples of the new binding, with semi-flexible covers, and\nshowed them to several leading booksellers and department store buyers.\nThe response was favorable, and they decided to go ahead.\n\nThe balloon cloth binding was officially introduced with the Modern\nLibrary’s January 1929 publications, Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry\n1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology* (169) and Gustave Flaubert’s\n*Salammbô* (170). The old spine and cover design continued to be used\nthrough March, but this was a temporary expedient. Shortly after they\ndecided to substitute balloon cloth for imitation leather, Cerf and\nKlopfer asked Rockwell Kent, who had created the Random House device in\n1927, to make a “simple . . . but characteristic Kentian design for the\nback-strip” (Cerf to Kent, 11 December 1928). Kent more than fulfilled\nhis commission. He not only drew a striking new spine for Modern Library\nbook, but redesigned the torchbearer and created new endpapers as well.\n\nKent began with the idea of putting the torchbearer at the base of the\nspine, but decided that the figure was too attenuated for the space\navailable. Still, he felt that the torch idea should be kept and wanted\nto use a sizable spot of gold to make the spine distinctive. His first\nsolution was a design incorporating a candle. To Klopfer he wrote:\n\n> After, I assure you, making more designs for that book-back than there\n> are published works in the Modern Library; after considering and\n> rejecting innumerable pictorial designs, nudes, phallic symbols, and\n> so forth, as either inappropriate to book covers or indigestible to\n> middle western and New England patrons of your publications; I have\n> conceived and executed the somewhat trite, but I feel appropriate,\n> device which I enclose, and if you feel that in employing a candle as\n> part of it I have gone as far in suggestion as may be permitted,\n> please realize that I have shown some restraint in not making that\n> candle of the horrid dipped variety, so much in vogue in modern days\n> (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929).\n\nThe candle was never used. Cerf had warned Kent that the balloon cloth\nwould not take readily every kind of design, and the candle may have\nbeen too detailed to be stamped clearly. At that point Kent decided that\nnothing could be done with the original design and discarded it.\n\nThree weeks later he sent in an entirely new design. The new design, he\nnoted, “should not only work out better in stamping but . . . in every\nway pleases me more” (Kent to Klopfer, 16 February 1929). Intended for\nthe base of the spine, it consisted of an elegantly styled grape vine\nwith intertwined branches, leaves, and bunches of grapes. Beneath the\nroots of the vine the words “Modern Library” were lettered in sans-serif\ncapitals. Kent recommended that the lettering for the title and author\nat the head of the spine be drawn by hand. “You can get much more\nsatisfactory spacing in that way,” he wrote. “There are innumerable\nprofessional letterers, any of whom can do this every month for you,\npromptly and at little cost” (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929). The ML\ndoes not appear to have adopted this suggestion.\n\nFor the front cover of the binding Kent redrew Bernhard’s torchbearer.\nHe thought Bernhard’s figure was “good in design, but too grotesque to\nbe in keeping with the serious nature of the Modern Library.” Kent drew\na more graceful, floating figure, with the torch, instead of being held\naloft, carried in front of the runner with the flare trailing over the\nrunner’s head. He omitted the words “Modern Library” which had encircled\nBernhard’s figure on the grounds that it was sufficient to have them on\nthe spine. He also made two other changes in the figure. Bernhard’s\nfigure faced left, toward the spine. Kent thought this a violation of\ncommon sense and precedent in book design and turned it around. He also\naltered its sex. Bernhard’s figure was assumed to be feminine; around\nthe Modern Library office it was known as “a dame running away from\nBennett Cerf.” Kent made his version neuter. “I defy you to discover the\nfigure’s sex,” he told Klopfer. “That’s modern enough for you” (ibid).\n\nKent’s binding design was introduced with *The Cabala* by Thornton\nWilder, the Modern Library’s April 1929 title. Bernhard’s torchbearer\nwas not completely superseded by Kent’s figure. It never again appeared\non the binding or endpaper, but it continued to be used on Modern\nLibrary title pages and on many of the jackets.\n\nKent’s work for the Modern Library was a remarkable achievement in book\ndesign. The combination of smooth balloon cloth and Kent’s spine and\nfront cover designs produced what were perhaps the handsomest volumes\nthe Modern Library ever published. Unfortunately, Kent’s design appears\nto have been overly ambitious for books that retailed at ninety-five\ncents. The extra gold it required increased the Modern Library’s binding\ncosts by half a cent per copy. That half cent doomed the design, and it\nwas used in its complete form for less than two years.\n\nThe balloon cloth bindings were available in four colors: red, blue,\ngreen, and brown. The Modern Library published each title simultaneously\nin all four bindings. Two endpaper designs were used in 1929. Lucian Bernhard’s endpaper\nprinted in light yellowish brown remained in use through March. A new\nendpaper designed by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April in\nconjunction with his new binding. Copies of the first printing of\nThornton Wilder, *The Cabala* (175), which was published in April but\nprobably printed in March, exist with both endpapers. The paste-down and\nfree endpapers both featured Kent’s torchbearer at the center,\nsurrounded by a pattern of open books and the initials “ml”. The\nconjunct endpapers were identical except that the two torchbearers faced\neach other. For the first year Kent’s endpapers were available in four\ndifferent colors—light grayish red (18), dark yellowish pink (30), light\nreddish brown (42), and pale green (149)—and were color coordinated with\nthe balloon cloth bindings. Red bindings had light grayish red\nendpapers, blue and green bindings had pale green endpapers, and brown\nbindings had dark yellowish pink or light reddish brown endpapers.\n\nBeginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were printed in moderate\norange (53) and were used with all four binding colors. Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the\nWorld* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the\nlarger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that\nfall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper, with the central panels\nwith Kent’s torchbearer unchanged but with the surrounding pattern of\nopen books and the initials “ml” extended to fill the larger space, was\nintroduced in spring 1940.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nAll 1929 titles except *The Memoirs of Casanova* (185) were originally\npublished in uniform typographic jacket D. The Casanova jacket has an\ninset illustration of Casanova in left profile holding a candlestick in\none hand and opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle\ncasts a shadow of a satyr on the door. *The Memoirs of Casanova* appears\nto be the first ML title to have been published initially in a pictorial\njacket without the option of a uniform typographic jacket.\n\nAn unknown number of ML titles were available in optional pictorial\njackets as well as the uniform typographic jacket. 95 cents. *Dating keys:* (Spring) Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* xChaucer,\n*Canterbury Tales*. (Fall) Chaucer, *Canterbury Tales* xHemingway, *Sun\nAlso Rises*. Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel *All Quiet on the Western Front*,\nwith sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929\nbest-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of\n$5,000 to $10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in\nthe ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre,\nLittle, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of *All Quiet on the\nWestern Front* was published by Grosset & Dunlap, which distributed its\nhardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast,\nML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and\nthe book departments of major department stores.\n\nIn another long shot, Cerf offered a $6,000 advance against royalties of\n12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to\nLowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his\ncopyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive\nreprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s\ndeath, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.\n\nCerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford’s novel *The Honorable\nPeter Stirling*, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset\n& Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset &\nDunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book\n(Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley\nanthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11\nDecember 1929).\n\nHendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, *Tolerance* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1925), noting that it was “the sort of book to appeal to the\nfree-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor”\n(Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press\nsuggested André Tridon’s *Psychoanalysis*, originally published by B. W.\nHuebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both\nsuggestions were rejected.\n\nSeveral months after Edmond Rostand’s *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174)\nappeared in the ML, Duffield & Co. inquired if the ML would be\ninterested in Rostand’s later play *Chantecler* or Paul Verlaines’s\n*Poems*. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in *The\nHistory of Mr. Polly* by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24\nOctober 1929).\n\nAlbert Mordell sent his book, *The Erotic Motive in Literature* (Boni &\nLiveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no\nplace in the ML because its “appeal is special, and many statements that\nwould have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today” (Cerf to\nMordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell’s book revived in the\n1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier\nBooks and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several\ntranslations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and\nthe first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\n**Christmas gift boxes**\n\nThe ML produced three Christmas gift boxes in 1929. Each set consisted\nof three ML titles in a slipcase. The books had specially designed\npictorial jackets and were advertised as “specially boxed and bound in\ngay colors, with picture jackets” (ML ad, *PW* 116, 21 September 1929,\np. 1265). *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Modern Novels*\nwere new; *Three Great Renaissance Romances* was first offered as a\nChristmas gift box in 1928. The Keratol bindings used in 1928 were\nreplaced by colored balloon cloth which the ML had introduced as its\nstandard binding earlier in the year. The pictorial jackets used for\n*Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Renaissance Romances*\nwere later adapted for use on regular ML printings. Hynd’s pictorial\njackets for the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box were exceptional\nexamples of expressionist graphics but may have been too edgy for the\nML’s mainstream audience. Their use was limited to the 1929 gift box;\nthey were never adapted for use on copies of the books sold separately.\nThe retail price of each set was $2.85. The 1929 gift boxes were the\nlast, though unsold boxes continued to be listed in ML catalogs. The\nthree sets were:\n\n1\\. *Three Great French Romances*: Zola, *Nana*; Gautier, *Mademoiselle\nde Maupin*; Flaubert, *Madame Bovary*.\n\n2\\. *Three Great Renaissance Romances:* Cellini, *Autobiography*;\nMerejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*; Symonds, *Life of\nMichelangelo*.\n\n3\\. *Three Great Modern Novels*: Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*;\nButler, *Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *Return of the Native*.

(1954)\n172\n\nMerejkowski, *Death of the Gods* (1929) 173\n\nRostand, *Cyrano de Bergerac* (1929) 174\n\nWilder, *Cabala* (1929) 175\n\nPetronius, *Satyricon* (1929) 176\n\nStendhal, *Red and the Black* (1929) 177\n\nLandis, ed., *Four Famous Greek Plays* (1929) 178\n\nSmollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (1929) 179\n\nEllis, *Dance of Life* (1929) 180\n\nChaucer, *Canterbury Tales* (1929) 181\n\nSudermann, *Song of Songs* (1929) 182\n\nCalverton, ed., *Anthology of American Negro Literature* (1929) 183\n\nVan Vechten, *Peter Whiffle* (1929) 184\n\nCasanova, *Memoirs of Jacques Casanova* (1929) 185\n\nHomer, *Iliad* (1929) 186\n\nHomer, *Odyssey* (1929) 187 With a few exceptions such as Villon, *Poems* (55) and *Passages from\nthe Diary of Samuel Pepys* (89), the Boni & Liveright series remained\ntrue to its name and limited its scope to modern works. Cerf and Klopfer\nincreased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added\nDefoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto\nCellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928\nwhen Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and\nRabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles\npublished in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156),\nSmollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury\nTales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of\nthese works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York\nSociety for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them\nin the eyes of the shallowest modernist.
