Front flap: At no moment in history has the world [±have all the nations of the world] been confronted with such crucial political problems as those which are growing out of the present global war [±the two wars and their disastrous aftermath]. For this reason this publication of Aristotle’s classic work on the science and art of government in the definitive Jowett translation is as timely as it is essential to a comprehension of the basic principles of order in society. Here, for student and general reader alike, is the complete and unabridged version of thePolitics, with a biographical and interpretive Introduction by Max Lerner [—, Professor of Political Science at Williams College].

Discontinued 1971/72. Commins was pleased with the introduction except for a passage in which Lerner stated: “If we compare it with Plato’sRepublic, it is not a brilliantly written book. It mixes the great with the trivial; long stretches of it seem only pedantic categorizing; other stretches seem rather obvious. The whole is poorly proportioned and badly joined. Between the oases of insight there are desert wastes of pedestrian analysis.” Commins feared that the passage would discourage prospective readers (Commins to Lerner, 25 November 1942); Lerner agreed and it was omitted. The ML edition sold 4,319 copies by 1 November 1943. 362b.
