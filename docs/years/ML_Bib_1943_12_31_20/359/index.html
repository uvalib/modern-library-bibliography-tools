    "The three books which have provided spiritual solace for centuries are here brought together in a single volume for a time when the entire world is seeking comfort against the tragic impact of war. Here for sustenance in a moment of trial are: Boethius, the sixth-century Roman statesman who offers the consolatory gifts of philosophy; Thomas à Kempis, fifteenth-century German mystic whose book of simple devotional meditations has been an inspiration to Christians of all denominations; Sir Thomas Browne the seventeenth-century English physician whose faith was as sympathetic as it was imaginative. (Spring 1943)",
    "Original ML anthology. Published February 1943.WR13 March 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "The Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple Classics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation ofThe Imitation of Christis that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M. Dent, 1910). The text ofReligio Mediciprobably derives fromThe Religio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne(Everyman’s Library, 1906).",
    "Edman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for his work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000 words that would include discussions of the three individual works. When it arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind of introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the Modern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).",
    "Cerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of Boetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of Chicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical Library was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new one (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).",
    "J. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland, noted thatReligio Mediciwas on the Index and warned that its inclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised using a different translation ofThe Imitation of Christ. “If you could use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a Protestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this would make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio Medici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November 1942).",
    "Eckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his opinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the fact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough literate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point of view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral viewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman to Commins, 11 November 1942).",
    "The ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943."
