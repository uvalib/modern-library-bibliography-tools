Signed: EMcKK [E. McKnight Kauffer]. Front flap: For sheer entertainment, there are few romances comparable to Daphne du Maurier’sRebecca. Written with a deep intensity of emotion, it carries the reader headlong in its current to its final dramatic climax. The spirit of the dead mistress of Manderley hovers over the story, dominating the living until, in the end, her sinister spell is broken forever. As a novel,Rebeccawon the immediate favor of the reading public and maintained a leading place on the best-seller lists for several seasons. On the screen, it shattered all existing records for popularity and won almost every award which can be given to a motion picture. (Spring 1943) Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1938. ML edition (360.1, pp. [7], [1]–457) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published February 1943.WR13 March 1943. Discontinued 1971/72. The ML edition sold 4,592 copies by 1 November 1943. 360.2.  New bibliographical edition (1951?) Title as 360.1. Pp. [6], [1] 2–357 [358–362].

Jacket:As 360.1. (Spring 1952) ML edition (360.2, pp. [5], [1]–357) printed from Doubleday plates made from a different typesetting. The Doubleday plates that the ML was using by the early 1950s appear to have been made primarily for the use of publishers of inexpensive hardbound reprints. In addition to the ML they were used by Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press, Blakiston Co., Book League of America, and International Collector’s Library. The 360.2 plates reduced the length of the book by 100 pages by using smaller type and squeezing forty lines of text (five more than 360.1) to the page, thus significantly reducing printing costs. Both sets of plates used by the ML had been designed for full-sized books and in the ML’s compact format produced a type page with uncomfortably narrow margins.",
