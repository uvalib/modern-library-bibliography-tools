They are printed in large, clear type, with special consideration for readability, and are bound for durability in a format distinguished for its beauty and utility.

Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904), and its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20 vols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and Oxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its text publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text, Commins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the request that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to William T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943)."

In theNew Republic, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very agreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be congratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an omission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right to know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who has done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer, “Editions of Shakespeare,”New Republic, 10 January 1944, p. 57)."

These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis Miller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the original jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the second printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25 August 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the proof stage:"

      "#text": "The length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML to keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World War. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the fall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by different jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the only printings during the war."

Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be three or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted because of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to Mr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation, which made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95 cents and break even, was an additional complication."

I think we can produce 15,000 sets of these books for October 1st delivery. We can make our normal margin of profit and I think we can sell a good chunk of them this Fall. It will be years until we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the meantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume sets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The printing order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21 May 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July."
