They turned in large numbers to reading as an alternative. Demand for books was such that almost anything publishers brought out was snatched-up. Few publishers had ever encountered such demand for books and the experience was dazzling. But it also had drawbacks. “When you are able to sell any junk that you can get between covers,” Cerf commented, “it takes the kick out of putting over the really good numbers” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943). Between 1942 and 1943, sales of ML books increased from $339,902 to $596,454."

But there also seems to have been increased demand for books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry and philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a disproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong among men in the service."

Each volume contained specially commissioned illustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell, Salvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz Kredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes were one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in individually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943 in time for the Christmas season.  Fourteen additional titles were issued between 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library initially sold for $1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war forced the discontinuation of the series."

The binding, also designed by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth linen. Blumenthal’s binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or dark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped in gold. Kent’s torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on the spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were bordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside each panel."

The 360.2 plates reduced the length of the book by 100 pages by using smaller type and squeezing forty lines of text (five more than 360.1) to the page, thus significantly reducing printing costs. Both sets of plates used by the ML had been designed for full-sized books and in the ML’s compact format produced a type page with uncomfortably narrow margins."

Now Grant’s remaining two have been scrapped, along with two of our own, and five new ones substituted. I wish that Grant were here to forgive me.

I think we can produce 15,000 sets of these books for October 1st delivery. We can make our normal margin of profit and I think we can sell a good chunk of them this Fall. It will be years until we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the meantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume sets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The printing order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21 May 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July."
