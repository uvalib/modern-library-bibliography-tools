Publication announced for February 1943.WR7 August 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Cerf wrote in his foreword: The compilation of a volume of Great Modern Stories for the Modern Library was originally entrusted to the late Grant Overton in 1930. This amiable gentleman brought around his list in due course, but was far too good-natured and too gentle to hold out against the demands of Donald Klopfer and myself. The eleven stories that were finally included represented our own idea of a happy compromise: two of them were Overton’s choice and nine of them were ours. Now Grant’s remaining two have been scrapped, along with two of our own, and five new ones substituted. I wish that Grant were here to forgive me. He would say again, I know, “It’s your Library, boys; you know what you want to put into it!” Of the twelve stories in this new edition, my favorite four are “Heart of Darkness,” “The Apple-Tree,” “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” and “The Red Pony,” but the other eight are not far behind them. Anybody with a pastepot and scissors can—and does—perpetrate anthologies today, but I’d like to see anybody compile one that tops this collection in quality! It has variety, balance, color and distinction.
