<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1946</h1>
<h2>1946</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Random House bought its own building at 457 Madison Avenue and moved in
on 15 May. The firm had occupied rented offices at 20 East 57th Street
since 1927 but had to move after International Business Machines (IBM)
bought the building. The jackets of the first ML printings of <em>The
Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau</em> (384) and Koestler’s <em>Darkness at
Noon</em> (385) list the old address on the back panel. The Madison Avenue
address appears on the back panel beginning with Hersey’s <em>A Bell for
Adano</em> (386), published in April. The Madison Avenue building consisted
of the north wing of a mansion originally built in 1885 for Henry
Villard. The north wing (one of five separate units) was owned for many
years by the Fahnestock family and had been purchased by Joseph P.
Kennedy in 1944. Random House bought it from Kennedy for $420,000 and
spent an additional $100,000 renovating and furnishing it.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Eleven titles were added and five were discontinued, bringing the total
number of titles to 251.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>New titles issued in 1946 in the regular ML were published in the
standard format used over the war years with the binding measuring 7¼ x
4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x 118 mm).
Bindings were brown, blue, green or gray.</p>
<p>Inset panels of brown bindings were usually black; the panels of blue
bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black;
and those of gray bindings were usually green.</p>
<p>The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold.
Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on
the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside
the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left)
was stamped in gold on all titles.</p>
<p>Rockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a
central panel of 1¾ x 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer,
surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the
torchbearers.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents (January–October); $1.10 (November–December). The price
increase was the first for the regular ML since May 1920. The first new
title published at $1.10 was Rawlings, <em>The Yearling</em> (391), but the
$1.10 price was short lived. The retail price increased to $1.25 on 15
April 1947. The ML printed the list price at the top of the jacket flap,
and first printings of titles published at 95 cents and $1.10 are
commonly found in price-clipped jackets.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Hersey, <em>Bell for Adano</em> xBalzac, <em>Père Goriot &amp; Eugénie
Grandet</em>; Giants through G68; jackets: 309. (Fall) Balzac, <em>Père Goriot
&amp; Eugénie Grandet</em> xAristotle, <em>Introduction</em>; Giants through G70;
jackets: 316.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>William Rose, Jr., the president of Harper &amp;Brothers, cancelled a
proposed ML reprint of James Henry Breasted’s <em>The Conquest of
Civilization</em> (1926; rev. ed., 1938), noting that the book was basically
a trade edition of Breasted’s textbook <em>Ancient Times</em> (Ginn &amp; Co.,
1916; 2nd ed., 1935). Ginn was concerned that a 95-cent ML edition would
hurt sales of <em>Ancient Times</em> in college towns (Rose to Cerf, 5 July
1946). Klopfer rejected a suggestion to include H. G. Wells’s <em>History
of Mr. Polly</em> in the ML (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 9 September 1946). The
ML also decided against Sigmund Freud’s <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> (Dodd, Mead,
1932), which was not included in <em>The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud</em>
(Giant, 1938). A. A. Brill, who had translated <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> and
edited the Giant, sent a copy to Commins for consideration, indicating
that Dodd, Mead was willing to return all rights to the book (A. A.
Brill to Commins, 4 October 1946). The length of <em>Leonardo da
Vinci</em>—just 130 pages—was a problem. It never appeared in the ML, but
fifteen years later it was published in Vintage Books, Random House’s
quality paperback series.</p>

<p><strong>JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU. THE CONFESSIONS OF JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU.

delayed until early 1946.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial on cream paper in moderate brown (58), dark bluish
green (165), and black, with inset illustration by Hugo Steiner-Prag of
a small figure seated by a lake with mountains in the distance and three
trees in the foreground, all in moderate brown with dark bluish green
frame; illustration framed in dark bluish green (165), lettering in dark
bluish green and black, all within black and dark bluish green rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For almost two hundred years <em>The Confessions of Jean Jacques
Rousseau</em> has remained unchallenged as the classic book of
self-revelation. A tremendous influence on subsequent writing, it is
as meaningful for our generation as it was before, during and
immediately after the French Revolution. The very voice of the
enlightenment, it speaks with the same eloquence for every enlightened
reader today. The inclusion of <em>The Confessions</em>, complete and
unabridged, in the Modern Library series fulfills a long-cherished
plan of the editors. (<em>Spring 1946</em>) <em>Note:</em> The jacket illustration
is credited to Steiner-Prag on the front flap; Joseph Blumenthal was
responsible for the typographic design. (<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ML did not know the identity of the translator. ML edition printed
from plates made from a new typesetting. Scheduled for fall 1945;
published February 1946. <em>WR</em> 9 February 1946. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p><em>The Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau</em> was scheduled for publication
in fall 1945, and the verso of the title page of the first printing
states “FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION, 1945.” However, its listing in
<em>Publishers’ Weekly</em>’s “Weekly Record” of newly published books is in
the issue for 9 February 1946, and there is a spring 1946 list of ML
titles inside the first printing of the jacket. Publication may have
been delayed by the wave of strikes that accompanied the return to a
peacetime economy (<em>see</em> Neavill, “Publishing in Wartime,” <em>Library
Trends</em> 55 [Winter 2007], p. 593;
<a href="http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/slisfrp/62">http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/slisfrp/62</a>). Klopfer remarked later in
1946, “We are having the usual hellish time getting our books out and
the situation amongst the suppliers is certainly no easier than it was
at any time during the war” (Klopfer to Cerf, 14 August 1946).</p>
<p>The ML edition was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular
ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. Sales
totaled 45,924 copies by spring 1958.</p>

paper with title in reverse on circular black panel and other lettering
in black against deep reddish orange background; last line of front
panel: “<em>The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection.</em>”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Few novels of the last ten years have stirred up so much partisanship
and violent controversy as Arthur Koestler’s <em>Darkness at Noon</em>. Its
champions have proclaimed it as a penetrating study of revolutionary
psychology and the compulsions which lead to the catharsis of
confession; its adversaries, first to admit its overwhelming power,
attack it on the ground of its political implications. Both agree that
Arthur Koestler is a novelist of the foremost rank and a man with the
courage of his strong and brilliant convictions. (<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A except last line of front panel: “<em>A
Book-of-the-Month Club Selection</em>”. (<em>Spring 1951</em>) <em>Note:</em> <em>Darkness at
Noon</em> had been a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1941. The wording
of the jacket may have been revised to avoid the suggestion that it was
a current selection. Front flap revised with first sentence beginning
“Few modern novels have stirred up” and the following sentence added at
the end: “Recent history has provided corroborating testimony to his
fictional critique of the ruthlessness of modern revolutionary
procedures.” (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1941. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–267) printed from Macmillan plates. Publication scheduled for
February 1946. <em>WR</em> 16 March 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>Kostler wrote <em>Darkness at Noon</em> in German while living in Paris. The
sculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was
Koestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris
separately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once
she was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of <em>Darkness at
Noon</em> with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August
2013).</p>
<p>Cerf initially wanted to publish <em>Darkness at Noon</em> in the ML in fall
1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I
think it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do
well with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12
January 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for
fall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on
the grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our
relations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam,
Macmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML
edition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of
10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).</p>
<p><em>Darkness at Noon</em> was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club
for June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years
later, the ML jacket stated “<em>The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection</em>”; in
the early 1950s the wording was changed to “<em>A Book-of-the-Month Club
Selection</em>”.</p>
<p><em>Darkness at Noon</em> sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period,
November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and
Giant titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the new generation of novelists, risen to prominence during the
Second World War, no one stands higher than John Hersey. In <em>A Bell
for Adano</em> he has given the first fictional, and so far the most
eloquent, American interpretation of the struggle of democracy against
fascism. He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all
their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed
it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially
written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his
faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world.
(<em>Spring 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp.
[1]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. <em>WR</em> 27
April 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.</p>
<p>The ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a
copy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in
1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf,
Inc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A
Pocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.</p>
<p>Hersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in
place of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar
rather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began:
“Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It
is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”</p>
<p>On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent
of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in
this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of
September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military
Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than
average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was
just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two
things.</p>
<p>One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus
one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication
to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of
peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .</p>
<p>The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was
a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our
citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the
military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter
how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never
forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men,
when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones,
when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute
control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn
on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every
other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative
talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever
to appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November
1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in
the Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not
“consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere
else” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf
edition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint
editions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more
than thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.</p>
<p>Copies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of
the volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and
jacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author
stamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and
title printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is
indicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used
on ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as
regular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for
the use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.</p>
<p>The ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication
announced for February 1946. <em>WR</em> 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably
10,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf contacted Harper &amp; Bros. in 1944 about including <em>The Adventures
and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</em> in the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance
against royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10
cents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and
make new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a
way of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper &amp; Bros., 27
April 1944). Harper &amp; Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred
Cerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle
Estate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being
difficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a
period of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible
limitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes
stories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).</p>
<p>Klopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with
Watt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped
its proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a
three-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt
to drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML
would be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer,
4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is
included in Cerf and Klopfer, <em>Dear Donald, Dear Bennett</em>, pp. 195–98).
He also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500
advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was
considering putting <em>The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</em> into
the Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that,
although the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years
and he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at
ten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed
to a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five
years.</p>
<p>Vincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the
ML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I
would rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of
the American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty
corrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was
published without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a
first printing of 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952, placing <em>The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock
Holmes</em> high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The temptation to describe a book by Ogden Nash in his own light-verse
style is quickly overcome by mere trial. The simple truth is that he
is inimitable. He is [+original, he is] funny and he is profound; he
is clever and he is surprisingly penetrating; there are always both
rhyme and reason in his sensible nonsense. For this Modern Library
edition, Ogden Nash has made his own selection of 165 of his most
representative poems, each one a gem of humor and light-hearted
wisdom. (<em>Spring 1946; [Fall 1956]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A in vivid red (71) instead of strong orange and
grayish brown (61) instead of light grayish brown. Front flap as jacket
A fall 1956. (<em>Spring 1963</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for April 1946. <em>WR</em> 17
August 1946. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1968,
four years after Nash’s <em>Verses from 1929 On</em> (1964) was added to the
ML.</p>
<p>Cerf first inquired about a volume of Nash’s poems in 1943, remarking:
“We are veering more and more to the classics in the Modern Library, but
we have to put in an occasional modern volume to keep up appearances”
(Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 1 October 1943). At that
time Little, Brown did not want to authorize another reprint edition of
Nash’s poems. Garden City Publishing Co. was doing well with its
one-dollar reprint of <em>The Face Is Familiar: The Selected Verse of Ogden
Nash</em>, and <em>The Ogden Nash</em> <em>Pocket Book</em> was scheduled to appear as a
25-cent paperback early the following year (McIntyre to Cerf, 2 October
1943). The Garden City reprint, published in 1941, eventually went
through fifteen printings for a total of 172,500 copies; the Pocket
Books volume had nine printings through January 1946 for a total of
765,000 copies (Crandell, pp. 58–60, 76).</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy to Little, Brown &amp; Co. In 1957
Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown noted that the ML was still paying
royalties of 10 cents a copy although the retail price had been
increased several times (Thornhill to Klopfer, 17 September 1957).
Royalties appear to have been increased to 12 cents a copy.</p>
<p><em>The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash</em> sold 5,332 copies during the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML
and Giant titles.</p>

The nationwide revival of interest in the writings of Henry James has
created the demand for this new, popular-priced edition of <em>The Wings
of the Dove</em>. Considered by its author the most ambitious, by his
critics the most perceptive and by his ever-growing circle of devotees
his most highly sustained novel, it is given a distinguished place in
the Modern Library series beside two of his widely read works: <em>The
Portrait of a Lady</em>, Number 107, and <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>, Number
169. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket</em> <em>B:</em> As 389.1 except deep reddish brown (41) in place of dark

<p>Originally published in two volumes by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1902. ML
edition (381.1, pp. [1]–329; [1]–439) printed from Scribner plates
in a single volume with title retained in the heading of v. 1, p. 3 and
removed from the heading of vol. 2, p. 3; “Preface” printed from a new
typesetting. Publication announced for September 1946. <em>WR</em> 16 November
1946. First printing: Not ascertained but probably 5,000 copies.
Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>The ML paid Scribner’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a
copy. The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the
assumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML that <em>The Wings of
the Dove</em> did not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve
large reprint sales.</p>
<p>James’s Preface (pp. v–xxii) originally appeared in the New York Edition
of <em>The Novels and Tales of Henry James</em> (New York: Charles Scribner’s
Sons, 1907–17), in which <em>The Wings of the Dove</em> occupied vols. 19–20.
The New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type.
The ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s
edition and made plates that were used for ML printings.</p>
<p>Four years before <em>The Wings of the Dove</em> was added to the ML, Cerf
admitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf
to Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote,
“According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a
motion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the
Dove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make
a timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report,
however, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is
one of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than
Faulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political
dissertations” (“Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em>, June 20, 1942, p. 20).</p>
<p><em>The Wings of the Dove</em> was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the
regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1952–October 1952. In
contrast, James’s <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> (1936) was solidly in the first
quarter of ML titles, and <em>Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master</em>
(1930) was near the top of the second quarter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
In response to an ever-increasing number of written suggestions that
there be a larger representation of the novels of Balzac in the Modern
Library, the editors have chosen for inclusion in the series two of
his most famous works of fiction: <em>Père Goriot</em> and <em>Eugénie Grandet</em>.
In brand-new translations, the first by E. K. Brown of Chicago
University, and the second by Dorothea Walter and John Watkins, this
portion of the massive structure of the Human Comedy belongs among the
world’s greatest novels of creative imagination and social criticism.
(<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>

<p>E. K. Brown of Cornell University suggested that the ML needed a volume
of Balzac in addition to <em>Droll Stories</em> (221), which he considered
unrepresentative. “You have Stendhal, Flaubert and Maupassant, why not
Balzac?” (Brown to Cerf, 26 March 1943). Cerf commissioned him to
modernize existing English translations of <em>Père Goriot</em> and <em>Eugénie
Grandet</em> and to write an introduction. Brown agreed to a fee of $300 and
promised the manuscript within five months (Cerf to Brown, 25 August
1943). Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the
Balzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the
library which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four
months later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were
needed (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the
existing translations were probably very bad and favored doing new
translations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we
pay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to
advertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February
1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should
tell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this
point Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown,
10 February 1944).</p>
<p>Brown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed
work on the translation of <em>Eugénie Grandet</em>. In December he suggested
John Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4
December 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent $300 each to Brown and Watkins.
The financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and
Brown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that $500
would be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he
initially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being
unreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually
accepted the $300 fee.</p>
<p><em>Père Goriot &amp; Eugénie Grandet</em> did not rank among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November
1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Stein offered Brown $50 to add a one-page summary of Balzac’s life and a
short bibliography to the introduction (Stein to Brown, 27 January
1950). Brown inserted three paragraphs of biographical information after
the opening paragraph of the introduction. The additions to the
introduction extended its length by a page, and the bibliography
occupied an additional two pages. By using the blank page that followed
the introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96
occupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to
incorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length
of the volume. The title page was completely reset, and Brown’s
introduction was credited for the first time on the title page.</p>
<p>Brown also supplied a list of errors and misprints that appeared on
eight pages of the text. The plates were patched to correct the errors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
As American a book as <em>Tom Sawyer</em> or <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>, <em>The
Yearling</em> has achieved for itself within a few years a permanent place
in our national literature. It is a novel of living characters in an
unforgettable setting, with a wisdom as simple as it is tender and a
charm as natural as it is winning. The story of Jody Baxter and his
pet fawn is American folklore at its best. <em>The Yearling</em> is a novel
that stirs the heart with its understanding of boyhood and its love of
life. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>

<p>The ML paid Scribner’s royalties of 10 cents a copy on all copies sold
over 30,000. The royalty on the first 30,000 copies appears to have been
reduced or waived to cover the cost of making offset plates. Sales
appear to have exceeded 30,000 copies since the ML paid Scribner’s
royalties of $235 on sales of 2,355 copies sold after 30 October 1953
(Klopfer to Ruth Riggs, Scribner’s, 16 July 1954).</p>
<p>The ML’s reprint contract was limited to six years. After receiving a
report of sales through October 1953 and noting that <em>The Yearling</em> was
included on the ML’s spring 1954 list, Whitney Darrow of Scribner’s
reminded Cerf that the book was supposed to have been dropped from the
series by October 1952 (Darrow to Cerf, 19 April 1954). Klopfer replied
that <em>The Yearling</em> had stayed on the spring 1954 list by mistake and as
a result it had not been necessary to remainder any copies. He assured
Darrow that it was out of stock and would be replaced on the fall list
by Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric &amp; Poetics</em> (Klopfer to Darrow, 20 April 1954).</p>

<p>Burk was a music historian affiliated with the Boston Symphony. His
program notes about works being performed were included in the printed
programs, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on
Boston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’s
<em>Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography</em> in 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf
and Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins
suggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and
one-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works
(Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by
Random House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML
edition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000
copies and 10 cents a copy thereafter.</p>
<p><em>The Life and Works of Beethoven</em> was not among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November
1951–October 1952. It sold about 2,000 copies a year in the mid-1950s;
Cerf reported in 1960 that it sold “only moderately well” (Cerf to
Selden Rodman, 8 June 1960).</p>
<p>Burk indicated that his typescript was almost exactly 100,000 words and
that his first choice of someone to write an introduction was Aaron
Copeland, with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony,
as another possibility (Burk to Commins, 13 July 1942 and 27 November
1942; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library). In the
end the book was published without an introduction.</p>

<p>The list of phonograph records consisted of 78 rpm recordings and was
woefully out of date by 1954, six years after the introduction of the
long-playing record (LP). Burk suggested deleting the list, and Commins

<p>Front flap:<br>
For more than a quarter of a century Robert Frost has maintained a
position of unrivaled honor among living American poets. Associated
generally with New England, his works have transcended sectional
limitations and have become the lyrical voice of the entire land. Not
only has Robert Frost chosen 230 of his 270 published poems [±230 of
his poems for this collection], but he also contributes a personal
credo in the form of an Introductory Essay, “The Constant Symbol,” and
a new sonnet written especially for this volume. (<em>Fall 1946; [Spring
1955]</em>)</p>

Published November 1946. <em>WR</em> 14 December 1946. First printing: Not
ascertained. Discontinued spring 1963.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in
1940 (Cerf to Holt &amp; Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later
Robert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the
year, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated
that the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000
advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid
for and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write
an introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944).
It took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the
delay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan
conveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include
every poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of
Frost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and
Pocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). <em>The Pocket Book of
Robert Frost’s Poems</em> was published in 1946 and <em>The Complete Poems of
Robert Frost</em> (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern
Library contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500
advance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract
was for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless
terminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.</p>
<p>Linscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in <em>The
Collected Poems of Robert Frost</em> (Holt, 1939) and <em>A Witness Tree</em>
(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott
to Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided
that he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four
of the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had
left out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to
Mr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by
way of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but
instead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13
December 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four
poems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The
Mountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter
Night,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue
Ribbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking
with Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the
contents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only
“The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection.
Linscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages
(Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The
Constant Symbol,” was also published in <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> (October
1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost
appended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.</p>
<p><em>The Poems of Robert Frost</em> sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month
period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first
quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>
<p>No details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been
ascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt,
Rinehart &amp; Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in
1963.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the seventeen books by which William Faulkner has achieved an
international reputation as one of America’s leading novelists, <em>The
Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> are considered most
representative. The unsparing chronicler of the South, Faulkner is far
more than a regional novelist; he is the observer and the critic of a
doomed but tenacious civilization. His imaginary world is all of the
South cherishing the relics of a lost age of glory. For <em>The Sound and
the Fury</em> William Faulkner contributes a brilliant Appendix which
serves as his own last word on this controversial book. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>
<p>Front flap reset with first sentence revised as follows:</p>
<p>Of the twenty books for which William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em>
are considered by critics and general readers most representative of
his work. (<em>Spring 1963</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Sound and the Fury</em> originally published by Jonathan Cape and
Harrison Smith, 1929; <em>As I Lay Dying</em> originally published by Jonathan
Cape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from
a new typesetting. Published November 1946. <em>WR</em> 7 December 1946. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by
separate ML editions of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1966) and <em>As I Lay
Dying</em> (1967).</p>
<p>Faulkner’s <em>Sanctuary</em> (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only
Faulkner title in the series until the addition of <em>The Sound and the
Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a
Random House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith
and Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave
Random House publishing rights to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929), <em>As I
Lay Dying</em> (1930), <em>Sanctuary</em> (1931), <em>Light in August</em> (1932), and
<em>Pylon</em> (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread
critical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s
subsequent works, including <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (1936), <em>The
Unvanquished</em> (1938), <em>The Wild Palms</em> (1939), <em>The Hamlet</em> (1940), and
<em>Go Down, Moses</em> (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s
novels except <em>Soldier’s Pay</em> (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1926), <em>Mosquitoes</em>
(Boni &amp; Liveright, 1927) and <em>Sartoris</em> (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it
took ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf
and Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML.</p>
<p>Faulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published <em>The
Portable Faulkner</em>, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published <em>The
Sound and the Fury</em> &amp; <em>As I Lay Dying</em> in a single volume. The two
volumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of
Faulkner’s stature in the United States.</p>
<p>Evelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and
Robert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been
interested in publishing a ML edition of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> or <em>As
I Lay Dying</em> in the early 1930s but took <em>Sanctuary</em> instead because
plates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles
(Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and
1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a
second printing than to make plates—and plates were available for
<em>Sanctuary</em>.</p>
<p>Linscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint
of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (Linscott to Cowley, 31
December 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider <em>As I Lay Dying</em>
to be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way
below” <em>Light in August</em>. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the
two works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see <em>The
Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>Light in August</em> reprinted separately. He
continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The
Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he
tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I
don’t think that’s such a good idea either. [In its list for fall and
winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited
edition of <em>The Sound and the Fur</em>y with the text in three colors and
a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.] But
for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson
family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in
TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix?
(Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley
that the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to
write an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945
The Compsons” that Faulkner had written for <em>The Portable Faulkner</em>.
Cowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing
permission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing
Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,”
having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he
says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel.
His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has
some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if
they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the
Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the
novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he
has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys
at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow—
either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or
else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer,
because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or
else hijack a copy from some friend.</p>
<p>I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at
writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the
Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the
critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the
author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack
[<em>sic</em>], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it
carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction
more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a
short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention
among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s
not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business
[see G68]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway
(though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a
lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own
choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul
Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges
Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux,
perhaps, now writing in any language. . . .</p>
<p>I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to
start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from
questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing
with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too
much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not
enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels.
I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better
picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too,
under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are
planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of
money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on
it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot
to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an
end paper [paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as
a frontispiece]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and
shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an
unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising
appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the
way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books
beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with
the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry.</p>
<p>I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book [<em>The Portable
Faulkner</em>]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will
agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 [i.e., 1946];
underlining in original).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linscott replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not
only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants
it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . .</p>
<p>I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is
a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think
it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to
write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he
has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back.</p>
<p>Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable
will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will
help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more
likely to want to read the other.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY
DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than
THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott
to Cowley, 15 February 1946).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The
ML printed his Appendix from <em>The Portable Faulkner</em> with minor
revisions, placing it at the beginning of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>,
referring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by
the author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was
superseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of <em>The Sound
and the Fury</em> (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume
(pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four
novels (<em>Soldiers’ Pay</em>, <em>Mosquitoes</em>, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and <em>The
Sound and the Fury</em>), published in 2006, also prints the appendix
“Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (pp.
1127–41).</p>
<p><em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> sold 10,640 copies during the
twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh
best-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title
in the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American
writer and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind
Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more
than 10,000 copies at this period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maugham, <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (1930) 11,563</p>
<p>Aquinas, <em>Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas</em> (1948) 11,129</p>
<p>Aristotle, <em>Introduction to Aristotle</em> (1947) 11,114</p>
<p>Tolstoy, <em>War and Peace</em> (Giant, 1931) 11,111</p>
<p>Dostoyevsky, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (1932) 10,943</p>
<p>Freud, <em>Basic Writings</em> (Giant, 1938) 10,669</p>
<p>Faulkner, <em>Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> (1946) 10,640</p>
<p>Plato, <em>Works of Plato</em> (1930) 10,302</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em> was almost the ML’s sixth
best-selling title. <em>The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud</em> outsold the
Faulkner volume by twenty-nine copies.</p>
<p>Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years
after the publication of <em>The Portable Faulkner</em> and the ML edition of
<em>The Sound and the Fury &amp; As I Lay Dying</em>.</p>

The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside\nthe colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left)\nwas stamped in gold on all titles.\n\nRockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a\ncentral panel of 1¾ x 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer,\nsurrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the\ntorchbearers.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents (January–October); $1.10 (November–December).

The retail price increased to $1.25 on 15\nApril 1947.

Ginn was concerned that a 95-cent ML edition would\nhurt sales of *Ancient Times* in college towns (Rose to Cerf, 5 July\n1946). Klopfer rejected a suggestion to include H. G. Wells’s *History\nof Mr. Polly* in the ML (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 9 September 1946). The\nML also decided against Sigmund Freud’s *Leonardo da Vinci* (Dodd, Mead,\n1932), which was not included in *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud*\n(Giant, 1938). A. A. Brill, who had translated *Leonardo da Vinci* and\nedited the Giant, sent a copy to Commins for consideration, indicating\nthat Dodd, Mead was willing to return all rights to the book (A. A.\nBrill to Commins, 4 October 1946).

ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–267) printed from Macmillan plates. Publication scheduled for\nFebruary 1946. *WR* 16 March 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies.\n\nKostler wrote *Darkness at Noon* in German while living in Paris. The\nsculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was\nKoestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris\nseparately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once\nshe was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of *Darkness at\nNoon* with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August\n2013).\n\nCerf initially wanted to publish *Darkness at Noon* in the ML in fall\n1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I\nthink it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do\nwell with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12\nJanuary 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for\nfall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on\nthe grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our\nrelations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam,\nMacmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML\nedition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of\n10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).\n\n*Darkness at Noon* was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club\nfor June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years\nlater, the ML jacket stated “*The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection*”; in\nthe early 1950s the wording was changed to “*A Book-of-the-Month Club\nSelection*”.\n\n*Darkness at Noon* sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.\n\n### 386\n\n**JOHN HERSEY.

He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all\n> their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed\n> it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially\n> written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his\n> faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world.\n> (*Spring 1946*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp.\n\\[1\\]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. *WR* 27\nApril 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nThe ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a\ncopy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in\n1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf,\nInc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A\nPocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.\n\nHersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in\nplace of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar\nrather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:\n\n> For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began:\n> “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It\n> is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”\n>\n> On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent\n> of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in\n> this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of\n> September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military\n> Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than\n> average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was\n> just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two\n> things.\n>\n> One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus\n> one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication\n> to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of\n> peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .\n>\n> The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was\n> a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our\n> citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the\n> military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter\n> how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never\n> forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men,\n> when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones,\n> when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute\n> control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn\n> on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every\n> other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative\n> talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).\n\nCommins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever\nto appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November\n1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in\nthe Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not\n“consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere\nelse” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf\nedition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint\neditions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more\nthan thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.\n\nCopies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of\nthe volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and\njacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author\nstamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and\ntitle printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is\nindicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used\non ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as\nregular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for\nthe use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.\n\nThe ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n### 387\n\n**SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.

(*Spring 1946*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for February 1946. *WR* 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably\n10,000 copies.\n\nCerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about including *The Adventures\nand Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* in the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance\nagainst royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10\ncents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and\nmake new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a\nway of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27\nApril 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred\nCerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle\nEstate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being\ndifficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a\nperiod of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible\nlimitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes\nstories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).\n\nKlopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with\nWatt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped\nits proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a\nthree-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt\nto drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML\nwould be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer,\n4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is\nincluded in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, pp. 195–98).\nHe also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was\nconsidering putting *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* into\nthe Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that,\nalthough the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years\nand he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at\nten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed\nto a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five\nyears.\n\nVincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the\nML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I\nwould rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of\nthe American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty\ncorrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was\npublished without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a\nfirst printing of 10,000 copies.\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock\nHolmes* high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n#### 387b.

McIntyre, Little, Brown, 1 October 1943). At that\ntime Little, Brown did not want to authorize another reprint edition of\nNash’s poems. Garden City Publishing Co. was doing well with its\none-dollar reprint of *The Face Is Familiar: The Selected Verse of Ogden\nNash*, and *The Ogden Nash* *Pocket Book* was scheduled to appear as a\n25-cent paperback early the following year (McIntyre to Cerf, 2 October\n1943). The Garden City reprint, published in 1941, eventually went\nthrough fifteen printings for a total of 172,500 copies; the Pocket\nBooks volume had nine printings through January 1946 for a total of\n765,000 copies (Crandell, pp. 58–60, 76).\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy to Little, Brown & Co. In 1957\nArthur Thornhill of Little, Brown noted that the ML was still paying\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy although the retail price had been\nincreased several times (Thornhill to Klopfer, 17 September 1957).\nRoyalties appear to have been increased to 12 cents a copy.\n\n*The Selected Verse of Ogden Nash* sold 5,332 copies during the 12-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML\nand Giant titles.\n\n***Fall***\n\n### 389\n\n**HENRY JAMES.

(*Fall 1964*)\n\nOriginally published in two volumes by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1902. ML\nedition (381.1, pp. \\[1\\]–329; \\[1\\]–439) printed from Scribner plates\nin a single volume with title retained in the heading of v. 1, p. 3 and\nremoved from the heading of vol. 2, p. 3; “Preface” printed from a new\ntypesetting. Publication announced for September 1946. *WR* 16 November\n1946. First printing: Not ascertained but probably 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1969/70.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a\ncopy. The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the\nassumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML that *The Wings of\nthe Dove* did not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve\nlarge reprint sales.\n\nJames’s Preface (pp. v–xxii) originally appeared in the New York Edition\nof *The Novels and Tales of Henry James* (New York: Charles Scribner’s\nSons, 1907–17), in which *The Wings of the Dove* occupied vols. 19–20.\nThe New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type.\nThe ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s\nedition and made plates that were used for ML printings.\n\nFour years before *The Wings of the Dove* was added to the ML, Cerf\nadmitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf\nto Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote,\n“According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a\nmotion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the\nDove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make\na timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report,\nhowever, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is\none of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than\nFaulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political\ndissertations” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, June 20, 1942, p. 20).\n\n*The Wings of the Dove* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the 12-month period, November 1952–October 1952. In\ncontrast, James’s *Portrait of a Lady* (1936) was solidly in the first\nquarter of ML titles, and *Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master*\n(1930) was near the top of the second quarter.\n\n### 389.2.

Brown of Cornell University suggested that the ML needed a volume\nof Balzac in addition to *Droll Stories* (221), which he considered\nunrepresentative. “You have Stendhal, Flaubert and Maupassant, why not\nBalzac?” (Brown to Cerf, 26 March 1943). Cerf commissioned him to\nmodernize existing English translations of *Père Goriot* and *Eugénie\nGrandet* and to write an introduction. Brown agreed to a fee of $300 and\npromised the manuscript within five months (Cerf to Brown, 25 August\n1943). Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the\nBalzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the\nlibrary which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four\nmonths later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were\nneeded (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the\nexisting translations were probably very bad and favored doing new\ntranslations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we\npay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to\nadvertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February\n1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should\ntell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this\npoint Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown,\n10 February 1944).\n\nBrown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed\nwork on the translation of *Eugénie Grandet*. In December he suggested\nJohn Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4\nDecember 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent $300 each to Brown and Watkins.\nThe financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and\nBrown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that $500\nwould be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he\ninitially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being\nunreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually\naccepted the $300 fee.\n\n*Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November\n1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 390b.

Brown inserted three paragraphs of biographical information after\nthe opening paragraph of the introduction. The additions to the\nintroduction extended its length by a page, and the bibliography\noccupied an additional two pages. By using the blank page that followed\nthe introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96\noccupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to\nincorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length\nof the volume. The title page was completely reset, and Brown’s\nintroduction was credited for the first time on the title page.\n\nBrown also supplied a list of errors and misprints that appeared on\neight pages of the text. The plates were patched to correct the errors.\n\n### 391\n\n**MARJORIE KINNAN RAWLINGS. THE YEARLING. 1946–1954. (ML 246)**\n\n#### 391.

The royalty on the first 30,000 copies appears to have been\nreduced or waived to cover the cost of making offset plates.

After receiving a\nreport of sales through October 1953 and noting that *The Yearling* was\nincluded on the ML’s spring 1954 list, Whitney Darrow of Scribner’s\nreminded Cerf that the book was supposed to have been dropped from the\nseries by October 1952 (Darrow to Cerf, 19 April 1954). Klopfer replied\nthat *The Yearling* had stayed on the spring 1954 list by mistake and as\na result it had not been necessary to remainder any copies. He assured\nDarrow that it was out of stock and would be replaced on the fall list\nby Aristotle’s *Rhetoric & Poetics* (Klopfer to Darrow, 20 April 1954).\n\n*The Yearling* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period, November 1952–October 1953.\n\n### 392\n\n**JOHN N.

His\nprogram notes about works being performed were included in the printed\nprograms, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on\nBoston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’s\n*Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography* in 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf\nand Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins\nsuggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and\none-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works\n(Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by\nRandom House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML\nedition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000\ncopies and 10 cents a copy thereafter.\n\n*The Life and Works of Beethoven* was not among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952. It sold about 2,000 copies a year in the mid-1950s;\nCerf reported in 1960 that it sold “only moderately well” (Cerf to\nSelden Rodman, 8 June 1960).\n\nBurk indicated that his typescript was almost exactly 100,000 words and\nthat his first choice of someone to write an introduction was Aaron\nCopeland, with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony,\nas another possibility (Burk to Commins, 13 July 1942 and 27 November\n1942; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library).

Discontinued spring 1963.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in\n1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later\nRobert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the\nyear, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated\nthat the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000\nadvance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid\nfor and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write\nan introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944).\nIt took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the\ndelay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan\nconveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include\nevery poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of\nFrost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and\nPocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). *The Pocket Book of\nRobert Frost’s Poems* was published in 1946 and *The Complete Poems of\nRobert Frost* (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern\nLibrary contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500\nadvance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract\nwas for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless\nterminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.\n\nLinscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in *The\nCollected Poems of Robert Frost* (Holt, 1939) and *A Witness Tree*\n(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott\nto Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided\nthat he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four\nof the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had\nleft out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to\nMr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by\nway of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but\ninstead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13\nDecember 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four\npoems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The\nMountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter\nNight,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue\nRibbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking\nwith Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the\ncontents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only\n“The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection.\nLinscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages\n(Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The\nConstant Symbol,” was also published in *Atlantic Monthly* (October\n1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost\nappended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.\n\n*The Poems of Robert Frost* sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\nNo details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been\nascertained.

His imaginary world is all of the\n> South cherishing the relics of a lost age of glory. For *The Sound and\n> the Fury* William Faulkner contributes a brilliant Appendix which\n> serves as his own last word on this controversial book. (*Fall 1946*)\n>\n> Front flap reset with first sentence revised as follows:\n>\n> Of the twenty books for which William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel\n> Prize for Literature, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*\n> are considered by critics and general readers most representative of\n> his work. (*Spring 1963*)\n\n*The Sound and the Fury* originally published by Jonathan Cape and\nHarrison Smith, 1929; *As I Lay Dying* originally published by Jonathan\nCape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from\na new typesetting. Published November 1946. *WR* 7 December 1946. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by\nseparate ML editions of *The Sound and the Fury* (1966) and *As I Lay\nDying* (1967).\n\nFaulkner’s *Sanctuary* (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only\nFaulkner title in the series until the addition of *The Sound and the\nFury & As I Lay Dying* fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a\nRandom House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith\nand Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave\nRandom House publishing rights to *The Sound and the Fury* (1929), *As I\nLay Dying* (1930), *Sanctuary* (1931), *Light in August* (1932), and\n*Pylon* (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread\ncritical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s\nsubsequent works, including *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936), *The\nUnvanquished* (1938), *The Wild Palms* (1939), *The Hamlet* (1940), and\n*Go Down, Moses* (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s\nnovels except *Soldier’s Pay* (Boni & Liveright, 1926), *Mosquitoes*\n(Boni & Liveright, 1927) and *Sartoris* (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it\ntook ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf\nand Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML.\n\nFaulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published *The\nPortable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published *The\nSound and the Fury* & *As I Lay Dying* in a single volume. The two\nvolumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of\nFaulkner’s stature in the United States.\n\nEvelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and\nRobert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been\ninterested in publishing a ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* or *As\nI Lay Dying* in the early 1930s but took *Sanctuary* instead because\nplates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles\n(Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and\n1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a\nsecond printing than to make plates—and plates were available for\n*Sanctuary*.\n\nLinscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint\nof *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (Linscott to Cowley, 31\nDecember 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider *As I Lay Dying*\nto be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way\nbelow” *Light in August*. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the\ntwo works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see *The\nSound and the Fury* and *Light in August* reprinted separately. He\ncontinued:\n\n> Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The\n> Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he\n> tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I\n> don’t think that’s such a good idea either. \\[In its list for fall and\n> winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited\n> edition of *The Sound and the Fur*y with the text in three colors and\n> a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.\\] But\n> for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson\n> family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in\n> TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix?\n> (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946).\n\nCowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley\nthat the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to\nwrite an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945\nThe Compsons” that Faulkner had written for *The Portable Faulkner*.\nCowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing\npermission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on:\n\n> Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing\n> Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,”\n> having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he\n> says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel.\n> His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has\n> some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if\n> they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the\n> Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the\n> novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he\n> has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys\n> at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow—\n> either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or\n> else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer,\n> because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or\n> else hijack a copy from some friend.\n>\n> I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at\n> writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the\n> Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the\n> critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the\n> author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack\n> \\[*sic*\\], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it\n> carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction\n> more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a\n> short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention\n> among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s\n> not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business\n> \\[see G68\\]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway\n> (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a\n> lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own\n> choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul\n> Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges\n> Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux,\n> perhaps, now writing in any language. . . .\n>\n> I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to\n> start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from\n> questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing\n> with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too\n> much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not\n> enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels.\n> I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better\n> picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too,\n> under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are\n> planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of\n> money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on\n> it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot\n> to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an\n> end paper \\[paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as\n> a frontispiece\\]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and\n> shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an\n> unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising\n> appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the\n> way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books\n> beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with\n> the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry.\n>\n> I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book \\[*The Portable\n> Faulkner*\\]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will\n> agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 \\[i.e., 1946\\];\n> underlining in original).\n\nLinscott replied:\n\n> I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not\n> only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants\n> it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . .\n>\n> I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is\n> a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think\n> it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to\n> write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he\n> has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back.\n>\n> Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable\n> will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will\n> help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more\n> likely to want to read the other.\n>\n> On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY\n> DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than\n> THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott\n> to Cowley, 15 February 1946).\n\nIn the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The\nML printed his Appendix from *The Portable Faulkner* with minor\nrevisions, placing it at the beginning of *The Sound and the Fury*,\nreferring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by\nthe author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was\nsuperseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of *The Sound\nand the Fury* (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume\n(pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four\nnovels (*Soldiers’ Pay*, *Mosquitoes*, *Flags in the Dust*, and *The\nSound and the Fury*), published in 2006, also prints the appendix\n“Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of *The Sound and the Fury* (pp.\n1127–41).\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* sold 10,640 copies during the\ntwelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh\nbest-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title\nin the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American\nwriter and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind\nMaugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more\nthan 10,000 copies at this period:\n\n> Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930) 11,563\n>\n> Aquinas, *Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas* (1948) 11,129\n>\n> Aristotle, *Introduction to Aristotle* (1947) 11,114\n>\n> Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (Giant, 1931) 11,111\n>\n> Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 10,943\n>\n> Freud, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1938) 10,669\n>\n> Faulkner, *Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (1946) 10,640\n>\n> Plato, *Works of Plato* (1930) 10,302\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was almost the ML’s sixth\nbest-selling title. *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* outsold the\nFaulkner volume by twenty-nine copies.\n\nFaulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years\nafter the publication of *The Portable Faulkner* and the ML edition of\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*.",

The wording\nof the jacket may have been revised to avoid the suggestion that it was\na current selection. Front flap revised with first sentence beginning\n“Few modern novels have stirred up” and the following sentence added at\nthe end: “Recent history has provided corroborating testimony to his\nfictional critique of the ruthlessness of modern revolutionary\nprocedures.” (*Fall 1956*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1941. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–267) printed from Macmillan plates. Publication scheduled for\nFebruary 1946. *WR* 16 March 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies.\n\nKostler wrote *Darkness at Noon* in German while living in Paris. The\nsculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was\nKoestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris\nseparately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once\nshe was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of *Darkness at\nNoon* with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August\n2013).\n\nCerf initially wanted to publish *Darkness at Noon* in the ML in fall\n1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I\nthink it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do\nwell with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12\nJanuary 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for\nfall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on\nthe grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our\nrelations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam,\nMacmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML\nedition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of\n10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).\n\n*Darkness at Noon* was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club\nfor June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years\nlater, the ML jacket stated “*The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection*”; in\nthe early 1950s the wording was changed to “*A Book-of-the-Month Club\nSelection*”.\n\n*Darkness at Noon* sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles."

In a brilliant new Foreword, especially\n> written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his\n> faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world.\n> (*Spring 1946*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp.\n\\[1\\]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. *WR* 27\nApril 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nThe ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a\ncopy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in\n1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf,\nInc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A\nPocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.\n\nHersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in\nplace of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar\nrather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:\n\n> For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began:\n> “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It\n> is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”\n>\n> On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent\n> of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in\n> this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of\n> September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military\n> Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than\n> average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was\n> just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two\n> things.\n>\n> One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus\n> one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication\n> to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of\n> peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .\n>\n> The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was\n> a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our\n> citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the\n> military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter\n> how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never\n> forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men,\n> when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones,\n> when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute\n> control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn\n> on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every\n> other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative\n> talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).\n\nCommins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever\nto appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November\n1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in\nthe Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not\n“consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere\nelse” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf\nedition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint\neditions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more\nthan thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.\n\nCopies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of\nthe volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and\njacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author\nstamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and\ntitle printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is\nindicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used\non ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as\nregular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for\nthe use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.\n\nThe ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952."

(*Spring 1946*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for February 1946. *WR* 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably\n10,000 copies.\n\nCerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about including *The Adventures\nand Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* in the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance\nagainst royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10\ncents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and\nmake new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a\nway of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27\nApril 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred\nCerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle\nEstate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being\ndifficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a\nperiod of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible\nlimitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes\nstories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).\n\nKlopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with\nWatt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped\nits proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a\nthree-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt\nto drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML\nwould be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer,\n4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is\nincluded in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, pp. 195–98).\nHe also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was\nconsidering putting *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* into\nthe Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that,\nalthough the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years\nand he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at\nten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed\nto a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five\nyears.\n\nVincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the\nML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I\nwould rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of\nthe American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty\ncorrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was\npublished without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a\nfirst printing of 10,000 copies.\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock\nHolmes* high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n#### 387b.

The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the\nassumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML that *The Wings of\nthe Dove* did not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve\nlarge reprint sales.\n\nJames’s Preface (pp. v–xxii) originally appeared in the New York Edition\nof *The Novels and Tales of Henry James* (New York: Charles Scribner’s\nSons, 1907–17), in which *The Wings of the Dove* occupied vols. 19–20.\nThe New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type.\nThe ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s\nedition and made plates that were used for ML printings.\n\nFour years before *The Wings of the Dove* was added to the ML, Cerf\nadmitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf\nto Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote,\n“According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a\nmotion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the\nDove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make\na timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report,\nhowever, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is\none of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than\nFaulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political\ndissertations” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, June 20, 1942, p. 20).\n\n*The Wings of the Dove* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the 12-month period, November 1952–October 1952.

Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the\nBalzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the\nlibrary which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four\nmonths later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were\nneeded (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the\nexisting translations were probably very bad and favored doing new\ntranslations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we\npay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to\nadvertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February\n1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should\ntell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this\npoint Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown,\n10 February 1944).\n\nBrown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed\nwork on the translation of *Eugénie Grandet*. In December he suggested\nJohn Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4\nDecember 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent $300 each to Brown and Watkins.\nThe financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and\nBrown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that $500\nwould be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he\ninitially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being\nunreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually\naccepted the $300 fee.\n\n*Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November\n1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 390b.

By using the blank page that followed\nthe introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96\noccupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to\nincorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length\nof the volume.

Random House published Burk’s\n*Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography* in 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf\nand Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML.

Discontinued spring 1963.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in\n1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later\nRobert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the\nyear, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated\nthat the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000\nadvance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid\nfor and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write\nan introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944).\nIt took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the\ndelay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan\nconveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include\nevery poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of\nFrost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and\nPocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). *The Pocket Book of\nRobert Frost’s Poems* was published in 1946 and *The Complete Poems of\nRobert Frost* (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern\nLibrary contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500\nadvance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract\nwas for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless\nterminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.\n\nLinscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in *The\nCollected Poems of Robert Frost* (Holt, 1939) and *A Witness Tree*\n(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott\nto Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided\nthat he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four\nof the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had\nleft out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to\nMr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by\nway of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but\ninstead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13\nDecember 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four\npoems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The\nMountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter\nNight,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue\nRibbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking\nwith Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the\ncontents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only\n“The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection.\nLinscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages\n(Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The\nConstant Symbol,” was also published in *Atlantic Monthly* (October\n1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost\nappended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.\n\n*The Poems of Robert Frost* sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\nNo details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been\nascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt,\nRinehart & Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in\n1963."

(*Spring 1963*)\n\n*The Sound and the Fury* originally published by Jonathan Cape and\nHarrison Smith, 1929; *As I Lay Dying* originally published by Jonathan\nCape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from\na new typesetting. Published November 1946. *WR* 7 December 1946. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by\nseparate ML editions of *The Sound and the Fury* (1966) and *As I Lay\nDying* (1967).\n\nFaulkner’s *Sanctuary* (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only\nFaulkner title in the series until the addition of *The Sound and the\nFury & As I Lay Dying* fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a\nRandom House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith\nand Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave\nRandom House publishing rights to *The Sound and the Fury* (1929), *As I\nLay Dying* (1930), *Sanctuary* (1931), *Light in August* (1932), and\n*Pylon* (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread\ncritical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s\nsubsequent works, including *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936), *The\nUnvanquished* (1938), *The Wild Palms* (1939), *The Hamlet* (1940), and\n*Go Down, Moses* (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s\nnovels except *Soldier’s Pay* (Boni & Liveright, 1926), *Mosquitoes*\n(Boni & Liveright, 1927) and *Sartoris* (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it\ntook ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf\nand Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML.\n\nFaulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published *The\nPortable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published *The\nSound and the Fury* & *As I Lay Dying* in a single volume. The two\nvolumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of\nFaulkner’s stature in the United States.\n\nEvelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and\nRobert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been\ninterested in publishing a ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* or *As\nI Lay Dying* in the early 1930s but took *Sanctuary* instead because\nplates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles\n(Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and\n1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a\nsecond printing than to make plates—and plates were available for\n*Sanctuary*.\n\nLinscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint\nof *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (Linscott to Cowley, 31\nDecember 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider *As I Lay Dying*\nto be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way\nbelow” *Light in August*. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the\ntwo works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see *The\nSound and the Fury* and *Light in August* reprinted separately. He\ncontinued:\n\n> Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The\n> Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he\n> tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I\n> don’t think that’s such a good idea either. \\[In its list for fall and\n> winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited\n> edition of *The Sound and the Fur*y with the text in three colors and\n> a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.\\] But\n> for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson\n> family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in\n> TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix?\n> (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946).\n\nCowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley\nthat the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to\nwrite an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945\nThe Compsons” that Faulkner had written for *The Portable Faulkner*.\nCowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing\npermission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on:\n\n> Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing\n> Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,”\n> having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he\n> says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel.\n> His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has\n> some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if\n> they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the\n> Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the\n> novel).

(Zamatterafack\n> \\[*sic*\\], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it\n> carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction\n> more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a\n> short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention\n> among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s\n> not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business\n> \\[see G68\\]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway\n> (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a\n> lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own\n> choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul\n> Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges\n> Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux,\n> perhaps, now writing in any language. . . .\n>\n> I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to\n> start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from\n> questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing\n> with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too\n> much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not\n> enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels.\n> I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better\n> picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too,\n> under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are\n> planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of\n> money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on\n> it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot\n> to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an\n> end paper \\[paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as\n> a frontispiece\\]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and\n> shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an\n> unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising\n> appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the\n> way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books\n> beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with\n> the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry.\n>\n> I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book \\[*The Portable\n> Faulkner*\\]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will\n> agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 \\[i.e., 1946\\];\n> underlining in original).\n\nLinscott replied:\n\n> I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not\n> only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants\n> it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . .\n>\n> I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is\n> a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think\n> it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to\n> write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he\n> has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back.\n>\n> Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable\n> will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will\n> help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more\n> likely to want to read the other.\n>\n> On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY\n> DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than\n> THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott\n> to Cowley, 15 February 1946).\n\nIn the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The\nML printed his Appendix from *The Portable Faulkner* with minor\nrevisions, placing it at the beginning of *The Sound and the Fury*,\nreferring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by\nthe author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was\nsuperseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of *The Sound\nand the Fury* (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume\n(pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four\nnovels (*Soldiers’ Pay*, *Mosquitoes*, *Flags in the Dust*, and *The\nSound and the Fury*), published in 2006, also prints the appendix\n“Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of *The Sound and the Fury* (pp.\n1127–41).\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* sold 10,640 copies during the\ntwelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh\nbest-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title\nin the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American\nwriter and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind\nMaugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more\nthan 10,000 copies at this period:\n\n> Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930) 11,563\n>\n> Aquinas, *Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas* (1948) 11,129\n>\n> Aristotle, *Introduction to Aristotle* (1947) 11,114\n>\n> Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (Giant, 1931) 11,111\n>\n> Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 10,943\n>\n> Freud, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1938) 10,669\n>\n> Faulkner, *Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (1946) 10,640\n>\n> Plato, *Works of Plato* (1930) 10,302\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was almost the ML’s sixth\nbest-selling title. *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* outsold the\nFaulkner volume by twenty-nine copies.\n\nFaulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years\nafter the publication of *The Portable Faulkner* and the ML edition of\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*."
