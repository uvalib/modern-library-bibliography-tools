<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1931</h1>
<h2>1931</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>It took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest
levels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales
fluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears
to have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream
books sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML
sales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for
September 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s
history up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of
Books,” <em>PW</em>, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; <em>PW</em>, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).</p>
<p>Modern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to
include works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to
accommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in
fall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, <em>War and Peace</em> (G1),
Boswell, <em>Life of Samuel Johnson</em> (G2), and Hugo, <em>Les Misérables</em> (G3).
The Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm)
with hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the
volumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for
one dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were
ideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate
success.</p>
<p>In contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and
Klopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint
collapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers
for their collections. One collector, whose library included a large
number of Kelmscott Press books, including <em>The Works of Geoffrey
Chaucer</em>, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden
Cockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically
everything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales
representatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was
asked for suggestions, he could only reply, “I don’t know a soul who
wants to buy a lot of press books today” (Carl Smalley to Cerf and
Klopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933
Random House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of
the original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells’s <em>Time
Machine</em> designed by W. A. Dwiggins ($12.50 list) was available for
$2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne ($42.00 list)
was reduced to $10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides
($85.00 list) was $15.00.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under
the Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for “specials”
intended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML
plates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on
good quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt
tops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of $2.50. The
venture was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title
were printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in
major cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did
not do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that
they would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 “was one
of those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to
Cerf, 18 August 1932).</p>
<p>RH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but
the books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML
plates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50
cents.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Twenty-one titles were added to the regular ML in 1931 and five were
discontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 198. Minor
discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on inside
panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including
titles projected for January publication on fall lists. The new ML
Giants series was introduced in fall 1931 with three titles: Tolstoy,
<em>War and Peace</em> (G1), Boswell, <em>Life of Samuel Johnson</em> (G2), and Hugo,
<em>Les Misérables</em> (G3).</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles except Conrad, <em>Lord Jim</em> (230) were published in the
standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)
and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). <em>Lord Jim</em> was 6⅞
x 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm) with the leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in. (171 x
113 mm).</p>
<p>The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured
7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120
mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the
binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½
in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.</p>
<p>Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the
sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most
books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and
bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with
the title in open-face type and torchbearer A2, A3, or A6 (see
individual entries). Beginning in January 1931 Cerf and Klopfer added
their names to the imprint:</p>
<p>BENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER</p>
<p>T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y</p>
<p>NEW YORK</p>
<p>The imprints of three 1931 titles—Fielding, <em>History of Tom Jones</em>
(208), Boccaccio, <em>Decameron</em> (209), and Balzac, <em>Droll Stories</em>
(221)—differed from the standard format. <em>The History of Tom Jones</em> had
a colon instead of a dot between Cerf and Klopfer’s names; <em>The
Decameron</em> and <em>Droll Stories</em> reverted to the two-line format without
Cerf and Klopfer’s names.</p>
<p>The imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line
format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing
firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and
Klopfer as partners.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>Balloon cloth binding C, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped
in gold on the front panel and the 2-line imprint MODERN LIBRARY stamped
in gold at the base of the spine, was used through April 1931. Balloon
cloth binding D, with the front panel as binding C and the stylized
initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine, was
introduced in May and remained in use through spring 1939.</p>
<p>Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,
blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all
four bindings.</p>
<p>The Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation, which supplied some or all of the
ML’s balloon cloth, decided to liquidate. Holliston Mills, Inc., took
over Siegbert’s stock, trademarks, and patent rights.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange
endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930
through spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were
published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles
beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was
introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s
torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books
and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>Twelve of the 1931 titles were published in individually designed
pictorial jackets. Five were published in uniform typographic jacket D
and three in uniform typographic jacket E. The individually designed
jacket of Wells, <em>Tono-Bungay</em> (225) features the 2-line title
sandwiched between six strong yellow green bands, simulating a barrel
labeled TONO BUNGAY.</p>

<h3>Dating keys</h3>

<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling’s <em>Kim</em> in the ML, possibly as a
replacement for <em>Soldiers</em> <em>Three</em> which was dropped from the series in
1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran
was not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17
February 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson
Doubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. <em>Kim</em> (433) did not
appear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams,
<em>Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres</em>, the trade edition of which was
originally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there
was very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced
edition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931).
Herschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt &amp; Co.,
asked why Gogol’s <em>Dead Souls</em> wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead
Souls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to
it. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf,
undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). <em>Dead Souls</em> (290) was
published in the ML in 1936.</p>
<p>Cerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur
Schnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a
potential replacement for Schnitzler’s novel <em>Bertha Garlan</em> (38) which
was discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a
collection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title <em>Little Novels</em> in
1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or
Cerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology <em>Great German Short
Novels and Stories</em> (256), published in April 1933, he included
Schnitzler’s story “The Fate of the Baron” from the Simon and Schuster
collection.</p>
<p>Cerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon’s <em>Memoirs of a Fox Hunting
Man</em>, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was
interested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML’s format,
and he had reservations about Sassoon’s popularity in the United States.
He eventually declined: “Maybe something will come along to increase
Sassoon’s popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will
allow us to reopen negotiations on this book” (Cerf to Coward, 10
February 1931; 9 July 1931).</p>
<p>R. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested <em>Wolfgang Goethe</em>, a
two-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML
Giants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied,
“Cheers! What a <u>lousy</u> idea” (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931;
underlining in original).</p>
<p>When M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion
of a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, “I have the very definite
feeling that ed. &amp; Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of
the reprints of Mr. Bromfield’s books” (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October
1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar &amp; Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell’s
<em>Moon-Calf</em>, <em>The Briary-Bush</em>, or <em>Janet March</em>, which were then the
property of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, “I frankly don’t think
that Dell’s old books are read widely enough today to justify their
inclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be
belonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I
wrong?” (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22
December 1931).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
It is generally conceded by critics, and certainly it is staunchly
maintained by hosts of readers, that Arnold Bennett’s most notable
literary achievement is <em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em>. This chronicle of the
Five Towns and France during the Siege of Paris is a project of heroic
proportions, accomplished with infinite skill, and of a scope that
invites comparison with the greatest novels of the Victorian era. It
is a tale of ordinary people during extraordinary times, told with an
insight encountered only in the works of the masters of fiction.
(<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1909. New
bibliographical edition with preface by Bennett published by George H.
Doran Co., 1911, and subsequently by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting that Doubleday, Doran
appears to have made for the ML’s exclusive use. Published January 1931.
<em>WR</em> 14 February 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued
1972.</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four
long-sought Doubleday titles—Bennett’s <em>Old Wives’ Tale</em>, Maugham’s <em>Of
Human Bondage</em> (199), Walpole’s <em>Fortitude</em> (201), and Huxley’s <em>Point
Counter Point</em> (203)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from
Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML had
exclusive reprint rights to <em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em> and paid Doubleday,
Doran a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a
second printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of
3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in
1933. Cerf stated in 1946 that <em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em> “remains, year in
and year out, one of the most popular novels in the Modern Library”
(Cerf, “Trade Winds,” <em>SRL</em> 29, 24 August 1946, p. 18).</p>
<p><em>The Old Wives’ Tale</em> was the third best-selling ML title during the
first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,816
copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing
it in the second quarter ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the
100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952.</p>

It is now almost two hundred years since Henry Fielding developed in
<em>Tom Jones</em> a new approach and a new field for the novel. Treasured as
one of the greatest achievements in the literature of fiction, it
retains all the vitality and contemporaneity of the eternally human.
Its unrestrained commentaries on the life of the period, its ridicule
of the pretensions and its tolerance of the frailties of mankind, its
naturalness and its unforgettable characters, assure the permanence of
<em>Tom Jones</em> through the ages. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Henry Fielding’s story of a foundling is now more than two hundred
years old, but still it has the vitality and appeal it had for its
readers in the middle of the eighteenth century. Then, with few
predecessors, Fielding created his own form and brought forth a
pioneer work of English fiction. Now, with countless imitators, his
book is read with the kind of appreciation one reserves for a novel
that understands the ageless frailties of mankind and forgives them. A
book that makes pretensions ridiculous and shows tolerance for
weakness is ageless. <em>Tom Jones</em> is remembered with affection by
readers of every variety for its complete naturalness and for its
vivid characters. After two centuries the permanence of Henry
Fielding’s novel is assured. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Ever since its publication in 1749, <em>Tom Jones</em> has been a classic of
English literature. Unforgettable characters and episodes emerge in
its pages: Tom himself—loving, high-spirited, brimming with impetuous
vigor; irascible Squire Western with his dogs and drink; Sophia
Western, who sees through sham with a gentle “Fie!,” and marvelously
understands how to manage her prickly father; Mr. Allworthy, seeker of
justice, blinded by his own good heart; Square the philosopher; Mr.
Thwackum the divine; the black Blifil; and the author himself,
permeating every page with kindly admonitions, scorn of hypocrisy, and
admiration of the true virtue found in clarity of vision and a prudent
disciplining of the spontaneous urgings of one’s own good nature.
Picaresque novel, comic mock epic in prose, <em>Tom Jones</em> ranks in the
forefront of world literature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
An enormous, exuberant novel of appetite—for food, drink, women,
experience—<em>Tom Jones</em> is, according to Samuel Coleridge, one of the
most nearly perfect plots in the world. A foundling, Tom, is
discovered one morning by Squire Allworthy and his squarish sister
Bridget and brought up as a son in their household until it is time
for him to leave and seek not only his fortune but his real identity.
Athletic, charismatic, generous, filled with what Fielding called “the
glorious lust of doing good” but with a tendency toward dissolution,
Tom Jones is one of the first characters in fiction ever to display
legitimate sides of good and evil. <em>Tom Jones</em>, the novel is one of
the first examples of the “novel of incident,” one which develops
character along with plot, and a crucial influence upon the
development of modern fiction.</p>

<p>Bowers edition originally published in two volumes by Wesleyan
University Press, 1975, and reprinted in one volume. ML edition (pp.
[3]–982) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the
one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition with the following material
omitted: dedication (“To Ruthe”), table of contents, list of plates,
preface signed by Battestin and Bowers, Battestin’s introduction, fly
title (a reproduction of the title page of the 1749 edition), and all
appendices (chronology of important dates, select bibliography, index to
the corrections, abbreviations used in the notes). The illustrations by
Warren Chappell (color plates and line drawings) and the color map on
the endpapers are also omitted, as is the list of plates. Published
spring 1985 at $10.95. ISBN 0-394-60519-5.</p>
<p><em>The History of Tom Jones</em> (208.3) is in the 8¼ x 5½ inch format
formerly used for ML Giants.</p>
<p>Lines 3–4 of the title page are doubly flawed: Battestin’s introduction
is not included in the ML edition, and Battestin’s name is misspelled.</p>
<p>The full-page color and black-and-white illustrations by Warren Chappell
in the one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition were originally
created for the Illustrated Modern Library edition of <em>The History of
Tom Jones</em> (IML 5, 1943). Chappell’s black-and-white vignettes at the
head of the dedication, each of the eighteen books, and the end of the
Illustrated Modern Library edition are omitted; in their place the
Wesleyan University Press substitutes two flourishes and a swelled rule
at the head of the introduction, a swelled rule and fluerons below the
heading for each book, and a drawing of a couple walking arm-in-arm at
the end of the text. All of these illustrations are omitted from the ML
edition, which otherwise is a photographic reproduction of pp. [3]–982
of Wesleyan University Press edition, printed by offset lithography with

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
For more than five centuries Giovanni Boccaccio’s <em>The Decameron</em> has
stood virtually unchallenged in its supremacy as the world’s greatest
collection of tales. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Keats and many other
literary immortals found in these Florentine stories a never-failing
inspiration and a veritable source book for plot material. To the
modern reader, <em>The Decameron</em> affords undiminished stimulation and
pleasure, despite the strictures and the vain attempts at suppression
by hysterical censors. Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the
best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Payne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February
1931. <em>WR</em> 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded
1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that <em>The Decameron</em>
would not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of
occasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury
Department did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its
importation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A.
Falk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who
indicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include
shocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).</p>
<p>The ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to
John S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of
Vice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of <em>The
Decameron</em>, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American
universities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He
stated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p.
xxii).</p>
<p>Cerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously,
but Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed
foreword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our
friend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I
rather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors,
might shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27
December 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the
title page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees.
Cerf assured booksellers in an article in <em>PW</em> that the Payne
translation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying
the sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of
public morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” <em>PW</em>
119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).</p>
<p>Sumner did not challenge the ML edition, but <em>The Decameron</em> remained a
controversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who
specialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML
jacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any
title at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the
DROLL STORIES” (Wilcox &amp; Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales
representative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of
titles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked
Lewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised:
“Leave out Faulkner &amp; Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern
maidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a
stink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).</p>
<p><em>The Decameron</em> was the best-selling ML title during the first six
months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies
during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the
first quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period
November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position
in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower
than in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.</p>

<p>The ML began to consider a new translation of <em>The Decameron</em> in 1953
when Barry Ulanov of Barnard College submitted a six-page sample
translation. Stein sent Ulanov’s sample to a number of readers but the
response was generally unfavorable. Several readers suggested Frances
Winwar’s translation as the best available. Stein wrote Winwar in
December to express interest in using her translation (Stein to Winwar,
22 December 1953). She subsequently sent ten pages of revisions that
were incorporated into the ML edition.</p>

<em>Lord Jim</em> is by all odds the most popular novel by Joseph Conrad, as

the story of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity. Conrad
wrote an admirer “I will have no favorites, but I do not feel grieved

that ‘I fail to understand’ . . .” (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday &amp; McClure Co., 1900. New
bibliographical edition published in Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co.’s Sun Dial
Library (1928), <em>The Malay Edition of the Works of Joseph Conrad</em>
(1929), and possibly elsewhere. ML edition (pp. [iii], [vii]–417)
printed from Sun Dial Library/Malay Edition plates with decorations in
the Malay Edition omitted from pp. [iii–iv] and [1–2] of ML
printings. Published February 1931. <em>WR</em> 21 March 1931. First printing:
Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.</p>
<p><em>Lord Jim</em> was the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the
ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML
paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.</p>
<p>The Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included
Canadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights
when they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers
when they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the
Macmillan Co. of Canada, sold <em>Lord Jim</em> for five months before
Blackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the
transgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped
selling <em>Lord Jim</em> in Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian
sales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards”
(Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to
Longwell, 4 September 1931).</p>
<p><em>Lord Jim</em> sold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant
titles. Conrad’s <em>Victory</em> (238) sold 7,335 copies during the same
period. Sales of <em>Lord Jim</em> totaled 115,000 copies by 1949. By the early
1950s Conrad was one of the best-selling authors in the ML. <em>Lord Jim</em>
sold 8,669 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October
1952, making it the 11th best-selling title in the regular ML; <em>Victory</em>
was the 15th best-selling title. <em>Nostromo</em> (438), published in November
1951, appears to have lagged behind Conrad’s other titles; it did not
rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML at this period.</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br>
Perhaps the most popular of all his novels, <em>Lord Jim</em> is undoubtedly
Joseph Conrad’s most exciting adventure story. Its theme of a heroic
man victimized by his own integrity and destroyed by his sense of lost
honor is one of the most appealing in the literature of idealism. All
the powers of a great descriptive artist and a thinker concerned with
courage and devotion and the crises of conscience are lavished upon
this tale of a man who stakes his life on a high principle and loses.
“I will have no favorites,” Conrad wrote to an admirer, “but I do not
feel grieved that you prefer <em>Lord Jim</em> to all my other books.”

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Concededly the most important autobiography that has yet been written
in America, <em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> has exercised an enormous
influence upon a generation now coming into its full maturity. An
edition of one hundred copies, printed privately in 1907, had aroused
profound admiration among scholars. When it was published in 1918, it
immediately won and has since held an assured place among the
significant works in American literature. This chronicle of a
brilliant career and a constant spiritual quest is one of our great
national literary treasures. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), deep red (13) and
gold on coated white paper with inset portrait of a young Henry Adams in
deep red within a gold frame with city buildings outside frame at left

lettering in deep red, all against vivid reddish orange background.
Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. Front flap as jacket A.
(<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
<p>Privately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade
edition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s
death. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927
and reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition
(pp. [v]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates.
Published March 1931. <em>WR</em> 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies.
Discontinued 1978/79.</p>
<p><em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> was one of the first titles Cerf tried to
get after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original
edition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a
reprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August
1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint.
Cerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of
the original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told
Houghton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be
taken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife,
Houghton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin
had reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It
will be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very
proud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).</p>
<p>He offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two
cents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for
nonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930;
Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf
did not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the
one-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin
reduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy
(Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s
to 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for
writing the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).</p>
<p>Scaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library
edition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the
plates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April
1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid
1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.</p>
<p>Later in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of <em>The
Education of Henry Adams</em> in the format of the new ML Giants series.
Around the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special
printing of Young’s <em>The Medici</em> in the same format that had been made
for Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of
the first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the
publisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500
each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”</p>
<p><em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> was the thirteenth best-selling ML title
during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It
sold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October
1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.
During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed
into the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782
copies.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
“Few books have had so unexpected success as <em>The Education of Henry
Adams</em>. Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one
hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author
declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He
bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical
Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first
published edition appeared. Although <em>The Education</em> had aroused a
deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one
of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great
popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best
sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant
works in American literature but among those which command a wide and
steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation,
the influence of the book is markedly increasing.” — from the

<p>Front flap:<br>
“No more savage book was ever written,” says Carl Van Doren of
<em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>. Far from being the children’s book that
simple-minded people have made it, Swift’s fierce satire burns with
hatred and revenge. It is a book for adults who must perceive beyond
the record of imaginary travels among pygmies and giants an account of
mankind in all its silly, vicious and hypocritical posturings.
Included in this volume are Swift’s bitter comedies <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>
and <em>The Battle of the Books</em>. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>

Superseded 1958 by <em>Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings</em> (502).</p>
<p>The text of <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>, according to the Prefatory Note, “is
substantially that of the second edition, with the corrections in Ford’s
interleaved copy” (p. v). The text of <em>Tale of a Tub</em> and <em>Battle of the
Books</em> “is based on that of the fifth edition published in 1710.
Together with the original notes from this edition are given a few from
Hawkesworth’s edition of Swift’s Works (1755–75) and from Sir Walter
Scott’s (1814); these are marked respectively with the initial H and S”
(p. vi). Van Doren received the ML’s standard $50 fee for writing the
introduction.</p>
<p><em>Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books</em> sold
5,463 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943,
placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not
rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the

<p>Front flap:<br>
At whatever age <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> may be read, it opens new worlds
to the imagination. For the child this chronicle of fabulous travels
among pygmies and giants is an adventure in strange encounters and
dramatic conflicts. For the adult it is a commentary and revelation on
the mind and behavior of mankind in all its frauds and attempts at
honesty, its fatuous and earnest struggles to live in some kind of
amity and its preposterous posturings. It is fierce satire with rich
meanings for every age and circumstance; it is pure fantasy and
startling reality that explores and exposes the frailty of man.
Included in this volume are Swift’s bitterly ironic comedies <em>A Tale
of a Tub</em> and <em>The Battle of the Books</em>. (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>

and the dedication omitted in the first printing. Publication initially
announced for August 1931. Published March 1931. <em>WR</em> 28 March 1931.
First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1955.</p>
<p><em>Parnassus on Wheels</em> was the second of eleven Sun Dial Library titles
added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in
1930. Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s
books—<em>The Haunted Bookshop</em> was also in the Sun Dial Library—and
settled on <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em>. Publication was announced for August
1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so
great,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to
bring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to
Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML
wrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new
printing they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had
been sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged
with Lippincott.</p>
<p>Morley’s novel <em>Kitty Foyle</em> was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett
and Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished
after the United States entered the Second World War. <em>Parnassus on
Wheels</em> sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley
was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling
titles—and he had two books in that category. <em>Human Being</em> (334), which
lasted just over five years in the series, outsold <em>Parnassus on Wheels</em>
by nearly 300 copies.</p>

Katherine Mansfield’s sharp perceptions of significant detail, her
vivid strokes of characterization and her ability so sensitively to
merge reality with unreality give to her short stories the qualities
of a remembered experience rather than those of a tale merely well
told. In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her
spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose
of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for
truth so evident in her life and work. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>

<p>Cerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint
contract with Knopf in October 1929 for <em>The Dove’s Nest</em>, paying a $500
advance. <em>The Garden Party</em> was not considered because an inexpensive
reprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML
bought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to
cancel the contract for <em>The Dove’s Nest</em> so that the ML could include
the more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against
royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The
royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when
the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June
1947).</p>
<p><em>The Garden Party</em> had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There
were printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938,
1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an
additional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies
during the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June
1938). <em>The Garden Party</em> sold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month
period May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles.
It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern
Library during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
All the basic concepts of anthropology have undergone a change in the
light of revised evolutionary theories and the findings of modern
biology, psychology and the social sciences. The purpose of this
volume is to bring together the greatest contemporary authorities in
anthropology and thereby effect a unity of thought and principle
concerning the nature of primitive man. This compilation provides the
lay reader with an accurate as well as an authoritative and easily
comprehended outline of the most enlightened views on the general
subject of anthropology. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
André Gide combines a rich and supple imagination with a conscience
that tolerates no squeamishness in the disclosure of the most personal
intimacies. The unspeakable has no existence for him; his service to
his own truth is constant and uncompromising. Of the thirty
distinguished volumes he has published, many of them rare and
unobtainable because of their revelations, <em>The Counterfeiters</em> is his
only novel, and he has avowed in his Journal: “Without reserve, I want
to pour into it everything.” The translation is complete and
unexpurgated. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bussy translation originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML
edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May
1931. <em>WR</em> 23 May 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall
1946. <em>The Counterfeiters</em> with <em>Journal of the Counterfeiters</em>
published spring 1962 (see 216.2).</p>
<p>Cerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition of <em>The
Counterfeiters</em>, offering a $700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a
copy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a
copy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was
intended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf,
18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x
4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.</p>
<p>Knopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication
date was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the
following year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s <em>Lafcadio’s
Adventures</em>, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in
spring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for <em>The Counterfeiters</em> (Knopf
to Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the
final reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably
similar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for
renewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep <em>The
Counterfeiters</em> in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any
spectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to
Knopf, 24 October 1939).</p>
<p><em>The Counterfeiters</em> sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and
Giant sales.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The history of world literature during the first half of the twentieth
century is now being written. Among the novels of that era a small
handful seem assured of permanence. They are Thomas Mann’s <em>The Magic
Mountain</em>, James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, Marcel Proust’s <em>Remembrance of
Things Past</em>, and—without question—André Gide’s <em>The Counterfeiters</em>.</p>
<p>Dorothy Bussy’s excellent translation of <em>Les Faux-Monnayeurs</em> was
first published in 1927. To this edition of <em>The Counterfeiters</em> has
been added the first English translation (by Justin O’Brien,
well-known authority on Gide and translator of the <em>Journals of André
Gide</em>) of the daybook kept by Gide while writing the novel. This
Journal of “The Counterfeiters” (<em>Journal des Faux-Monnayeurs</em>)
supplies a unique view into the mind of a great novelist at work.

<p>Front flap:<br>
The world owes its intimate knowledge of the Caesars to the researches
of Suetonius, who viewed Imperial Rome from the vantage point of the
first years of the Christian era. With a wealth of realistic detail,
with constant access to the private records in the possession of
Hadrian and with a first-hand supply of scandalous anecdote, Suetonius
enriched history with his vivid portraits of the flesh and blood
Caesars. The veracity and impartiality of this record of personalities
and events have made it endure through the centuries. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<p>Pinkerton translation originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch,
1914, using sheets of the British edition published by Martin Secker.
New bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by
Ernest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new
typesetting. Published July 1931. <em>WR</em> 15 August 1931. First (and only)
printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.</p>
<p>The ML paid Viking an $800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy.
The ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large
for its format.</p>
<p>Sales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other
advance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six
months of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to
competition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger
than the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in
1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches
taller than the ML edition.</p>
<p>The ML reprinted <em>Sanine</em> on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press
owned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act
restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the
U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast <em>Sanine</em>
irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the
unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold
Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be
made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and
would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf
suggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was
entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance
had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton
translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s
shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates
(Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates,
and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold
copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of all the distinguished novels written by Willa Cather, none has
brought her greater prestige or a wider circle of readers than <em>Death
Comes for the Archbishop</em>. This historical chronicle of the apostolic
mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and
Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity. Its
rich humanity and its stirring account of the tenacity of a race
giving way to the inevitable make it a memorable book to readers of
every shade of religious conviction and literary taste. (<em>Spring
1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published
September 1931. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies.
Discontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.</p>
<p>Willa Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to
include in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright.
Cerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s <em>My
Ántonia</em> or <em>The Song of the Lark</em>, offering royalties of eight cents a
copy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who
was then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they
approached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of <em>Death Comes for the
Archbishop</em>, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.</p>
<p>The ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.
The advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh
Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML
printings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies
(December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934),
5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the
ML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows:
14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910
copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).</p>
<p>After the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want
any of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked
Knopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of
the contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock
after the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf,
indicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September
25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so
much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do
is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH
COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It
seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather,
and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep
the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will
undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other
alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th
of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would
probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder
price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell
out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the
book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the
most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the
contract?</p>
<p>. . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give
up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett
and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to
renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss
Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to
say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from
her point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June
1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. <em>Death</em>
<em>Comes</em> <em>for</em> <em>the</em> <em>Archbishop</em> was listed in the ML’s spring 1937
catalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to
Eayrs, 28 May 1937).</p>
<p>In 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had
acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, published <em>Death Comes for the
Archbishop</em> in its paperback series Vintage Books.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Widely regarded as Willa Cather’s masterpiece, <em>Death Comes For The
Archbishop</em> is set in the mid-19th century. Two French
missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into
the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of
revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish
priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and
materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese,
knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father
indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the
padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men
stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe,
using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its
surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has
succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the
New Mexican way of life.</p>
<p>“There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly
quiet narrative. It is a severe, purely designed chalice of handbeaten
silver, filled to the brim with the white essential wine of
love. . . .” — <em>Saturday Review</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The Borgian era, with all its excesses of lust and murder, its
monstrous villainies and strange benevolences, is here unfolded in a
tapestry of unrestrained color and animation. Frederick Baron Corvo,
that unpredictable celebrant of Black Masses and practitioner of
bizarre literary heresies, depicts the unbridled licence of the 15th
Century with a demoniacal vision and an incandescent brilliance of
metaphor. <em>A History of the Borgias</em> throws new light on the myths and
legends surrounding one of the vilest and most glittering reigns of
human depravity. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. as <em>Chronicles of the House of Borgia</em> by
E. P. Dutton, 1901, using sheets of the English edition. ML edition
printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the Leslie
introduction added and the bibliography, appendices, and illustrations
from the original edition omitted. (The ML table of contents erroneously
lists appendices.) Published September 1931. <em>WR</em> 19 September 1931.
First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1960.</p>
<p>The ML edition was the first to be set in type and printed in the U.S.
Leslie’s introduction, a general study of the life and work of Frederick
Rolfe, “Baron Corvo,” originally appeared as the introduction to Corvo’s
<em>In His Own Image</em> (Knopf, 1925) and was reprinted by arrangement with
Knopf. The ML omitted several paragraphs of Leslie’s text and altered
the sentence beginning, “<em>Hadrian VII</em> is Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” to
“<em>Hadrian VII</em> with the possible exception of the Book on the Borgias is
Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” (ML, p. xxi).</p>
<p>Printings of the ML edition reached 36,000 copies by June 1954 (Woolf,
<em>Bibliography of Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo</em>, p. 46). <em>A History of
the Borgias</em> sold 2,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant
titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML
during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>English translation by George Robert Sims originally published in
London, 1874. Early editions did not identify the translator, and the ML
edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, did not
identify the translator either. Published October 1931. <em>WR</em> 7 November

<p>The translator states that “although <em>Les Cent Contes Drolatiques</em> were
completed and published in 1837, the present is the first English
version ever brought before the public” (Translator’s Preface, p. xi).
Klopfer was unaware of the translator’s identity. He noted, “The book
isn’t copyrighted in this country, but I cannot tell you who did the
translation. It is passable” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, John Lane, The

<p>Shortly after editing <em>Four Famous Greek Plays</em> (178), Paul Landis,
professor of English at the University of Illinois, reminded Cerf that
they had talked about a volume of Corneille and Racine to serve as a
companion to Molière’s <em>Plays</em> (110). “The need for such a book becomes
more and more urgent, but I have combed the existing translations pretty
thoroughly and have found none nearly good enough to justify reprinting”

The novel upon which William McFee’s reputation rests most securely is
<em>Casuals of the Sea</em>. When it appeared, twenty years ago, he was
hailed, with Joseph Conrad, as one of the two greatest story-tellers
of the sea. Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a
new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama
of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against
the forces of nature and man’s will. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1916. ML edition
printed from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new
typesetting. Published November 1931. <em>WR</em> 5 December 1931. First
printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.</p>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in
January 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly
interested in <em>Captain Macedoine’s Daughter</em>, but McFee appears to have
been opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf
invited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s <em>Purple Land</em> (134)
and indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the
possibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26
August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,
<em>Casuals of the Sea</em> and <em>Command</em>, were in the Sun Dial Library, which
the ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday
reprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both
novels, but in the end only <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> was added.</p>
<p>Morley’s introduction to <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> was originally for the
Lambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.</p>
<p>The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10
cents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when
there was a printing of 1,000 copies.</p>
<p><em>Casuals of the Sea</em> sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period
May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and
Giant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945.
It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during
the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>When Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition of <em>Command</em> in 1933, Cerf
responded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book,
but [it] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished
somewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de
Graff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In
1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in <em>Casuals of the Sea</em> to
McFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with
McFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to
be applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the
plates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a
copy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
After centuries, the derisive phrase “It’s a Marco Polo,” to indicate
a gross exaggeration, has been revised to convey the highest tribute
for accuracy and veracity. The merchant-traveller from Venice was the
first to cross the entire continent of Asia and to open one of the
main routes to China. The record of his adventures and explorations is
as fabulous as the truth. His is a travel book that time has
substantiated. Readers have enjoyed it with a zest worthy of the
Venetian nomad himself. (<em>Fall 1937</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Since H. G. Wells wrote <em>Tono-Bungay</em>, his forays into prophecy and
history have made him world famous. Yet it is doubtful whether his
later fame was as firmly grounded as the first spontaneous outburst of
acclaim given to <em>Tono-Bungay</em>. With its appearance, H. G. Wells
forced immediate recognition as a major figure in contemporary English
letters. Neither time nor all the subsequent writings of the prolific
and indefatigable Mr. Wells has dimmed the sparkle and vivacity of
this chronicle of chicanery and human credulity. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>

<p>Cerf expressed interest in <em>Tono-Bungay</em> in 1929 when he offered
Duffield &amp; Green a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.
He indicated that the offer would stand indefinitely, and these appear
to be the terms under which the ML edition was published two years
later. The plates became the property of Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. when Dodd,
Mead bought Duffield &amp; Green in 1934.</p>
<p>By June 1936 ML printings totaled 12,000 copies and sales totaled 10,675

<p>An internal RH memo (Regina Spirito to Manny Harper, 5 May 1945)
indicates that new plates were being made for <em>Tono-Bungay</em> along with
Maugham’s <em>Of Human Bondage</em> (199), Buck’s <em>The Good Earth</em> (266) and
Maugham’s <em>Moon and Sixpence</em> (283). By eliminating running heads,
printing more text on each page, and beginning new chapters on the same
page as the ending of the preceding chapter, the total number of pages
of <em>Tono-Bungay</em> was reduced from 460 to 400. Although Germany
surrendered to the Allies the day before Spirito’s memo was written, the
war with Japan continued for another four months. Publishers were
subjected to increasingly severe paper rationing during the Second World
War, and the crowded typesetting is typical of many books of the period.
It is not clear why the table of contents is paginated xix–xii.</p>
<p>The new typesetting of <em>The Good Earth</em> was also about 60 pages shorter
than the earlier edition. <em>Of Human Bondage</em> was only 6 pages shorter,
and the new typesetting of <em>Moon and Sixpence</em> was 27 pages longer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The revolutionary change of attitude toward sex within the last two
decades has given great impetus to scientific investigation into a
subject which had been taboo for centuries. This volume brings
together the most modern and enlightened views of men whose knowledge
and authority are internationally recognized. Havelock Ellis, Sigmund
Freud, Bertrand Russell, C. G. Jung, Franz Boas and Alfred Adler, to
name only a few of the contributors, are represented in a symposium as
candidly outspoken about sex as it is comprehensive and accurate.

Merejkowski’s famous historical trilogy, collectively entitled <em>Christ
and Anti-Christ</em>, begins with the volume <em>The Death of the Gods</em> (No.
153), continues with the biographical novel, <em>The Romance of Leonardo
Da Vinci</em> (No. 138), and comes to a conclusion with <em>Peter and
Alexis</em>. Each panel of this triptych is complete and self-contained,
yet it links together three epochal periods of world history: the 4th
century, the Renaissance and 18th century Russia. <em>Peter and Alexis</em>
becomes the climax of the entire work and thus one of Merejkowski’s
most absorbing novels. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. as <em>The Romance of Peter the Great</em> by
G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1906, in a different translation. Guerney’s
translation was commissioned and originally published by the ML.
Publication originally announced for August 1930. Published December
1931. <em>WR</em> not found***.*** First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued 1 January 1941.</p>
<p>The ML edition was published more than a year after its announced
publication date. Guerney (as usual) took longer than he anticipated to
complete the translation, and Cerf (as usual) expressed frustration and
irritation at the delay. Cerf indicated hopefully in February 1931 that
the translation was almost finished and that the book should be ready
around the first of May (Cerf to Crowder, 11 February 1931). Ten days
later he noted, “We have had a lot of trouble having the translation of
this book completed” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21
February 1931). A letter in June indicated, “. . . at present we do not
know when it will be finished and ready for publication” (ML to John D.
Rollo, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 9 June 1931).</p>

The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x\n4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.\n\nKnopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication\ndate was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the\nfollowing year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s *Lafcadio’s\nAdventures*, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in\nspring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for *The Counterfeiters* (Knopf\nto Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the\nfinal reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably\nsimilar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for\nrenewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep *The\nCounterfeiters* in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any\nspectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to\nKnopf, 24 October 1939).\n\n*The Counterfeiters* sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant sales.\n\n#",

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1931\n\n## 1931\n\n### General\n\nIt took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest\nlevels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales\nfluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears\nto have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream\nbooks sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML\nsales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for\nSeptember 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s\nhistory up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of\nBooks,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).\n\nModern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to\ninclude works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to\naccommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in\nfall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1),\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3).\nThe Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm)\nwith hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the\nvolumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for\none dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were\nideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate\nsuccess.\n\nIn contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and\nKlopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint\ncollapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers\nfor their collections. One collector, whose library included a large\nnumber of Kelmscott Press books, including *The Works of Geoffrey\nChaucer*, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden\nCockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically\neverything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales\nrepresentatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was\nasked for suggestions, he could only reply, “I don’t know a soul who\nwants to buy a lot of press books today” (Carl Smalley to Cerf and\nKlopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933\nRandom House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of\nthe original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells’s *Time\nMachine* designed by W. A. Dwiggins ($12.50 list) was available for\n$2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne ($42.00 list)\nwas reduced to $10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides\n($85.00 list) was $15.00.\n\nCerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under\nthe Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for “specials”\nintended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML\nplates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on\ngood quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt\ntops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of $2.50. The\nventure was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title\nwere printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in\nmajor cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did\nnot do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that\nthey would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nRH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but\nthe books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML\nplates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50\ncents.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nTwenty-one titles were added to the regular ML in 1931 and five were\ndiscontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 198. Minor\ndiscrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on inside\npanels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including\ntitles projected for January publication on fall lists. The new ML\nGiants series was introduced in fall 1931 with three titles: Tolstoy,\n*War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo,\n*Les Misérables* (G3).\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles except Conrad, *Lord Jim* (230) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Lord Jim* was 6⅞\nx 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm) with the leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in. (171 x\n113 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).\n\n### Title page\n\nAll new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and torchbearer A2, A3, or A6 (see\nindividual entries). Beginning in January 1931 Cerf and Klopfer added\ntheir names to the imprint:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprints of three 1931 titles—Fielding, *History of Tom Jones*\n(208), Boccaccio, *Decameron* (209), and Balzac, *Droll Stories*\n(221)—differed from the standard format. *The History of Tom Jones* had\na colon instead of a dot between Cerf and Klopfer’s names; *The\nDecameron* and *Droll Stories* reverted to the two-line format without\nCerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners.\n\n### Binding\n\nBalloon cloth binding C, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and the 2-line imprint MODERN LIBRARY stamped\nin gold at the base of the spine, was used through April 1931. Balloon\ncloth binding D, with the front panel as binding C and the stylized\ninitials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine, was\nintroduced in May and remained in use through spring 1939.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings.\n\nThe Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation, which supplied some or all of the\nML’s balloon cloth, decided to liquidate. Holliston Mills, Inc., took\nover Siegbert’s stock, trademarks, and patent rights.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nRockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTwelve of the 1931 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Five were published in uniform typographic jacket D\nand three in uniform typographic jacket E. The individually designed\njacket of Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225) features the 2-line title\nsandwiched between six strong yellow green bands, simulating a barrel\nlabeled TONO BUNGAY.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Conrad, *Lord Jim* xBalzac, *Droll Stories*. (Fall) Balzac,\n*Droll Stories* xDreiser, *Sister Carrie*; Giants through G3.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* in the ML, possibly as a\nreplacement for *Soldiers* *Three* which was dropped from the series in\n1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran\nwas not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17\nFebruary 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson\nDoubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. *Kim* (433) did not\nappear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams,\n*Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres*, the trade edition of which was\noriginally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there\nwas very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced\nedition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931).\nHerschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co.,\nasked why Gogol’s *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead\nSouls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to\nit. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf,\nundated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). *Dead Souls* (290) was\npublished in the ML in 1936.\n\nCerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur\nSchnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a\npotential replacement for Schnitzler’s novel *Bertha Garlan* (38) which\nwas discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a\ncollection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title *Little Novels* in\n1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or\nCerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* (256), published in April 1933, he included\nSchnitzler’s story “The Fate of the Baron” from the Simon and Schuster\ncollection.\n\nCerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon’s *Memoirs of a Fox Hunting\nMan*, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was\ninterested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML’s format,\nand he had reservations about Sassoon’s popularity in the United States.\nHe eventually declined: “Maybe something will come along to increase\nSassoon’s popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will\nallow us to reopen negotiations on this book” (Cerf to Coward, 10\nFebruary 1931; 9 July 1931).\n\nR. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested *Wolfgang Goethe*, a\ntwo-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML\nGiants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied,\n“Cheers! What a <u>lousy</u> idea” (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931;\nunderlining in original).\n\nWhen M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion\nof a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, “I have the very definite\nfeeling that ed. & Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of\nthe reprints of Mr. Bromfield’s books” (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October\n1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar & Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell’s\n*Moon-Calf*, *The Briary-Bush*, or *Janet March*, which were then the\nproperty of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, “I frankly don’t think\nthat Dell’s old books are read widely enough today to justify their\ninclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be\nbelonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I\nwrong?” (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22\nDecember 1931).\n\n### New titles\n\nBennett, *Old Wives’ Tale* (1931) 207\n\nFielding, *History of Tom Jones* (1931) 208\n\nBoccaccio, *Decameron* (1931) 209\n\nConrad, *Lord Jim* (1931) 210\n\nAdams, *Education of Henry Adams* (1931) 211\n\nSwift, *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books*\n(1931) 212\n\nMorley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (1931) 213\n\nMansfield, *Garden Party* (1931) 214\n\nCalverton, ed., *Making of Man: An Outline of Anthropology* (1931) 215\n\nGide, *Counterfeiters* (1931-1946) 216.1\\*\n\nSuetonius, *Lives of the Twelve Caesars* (1931) 217\n\nArtzibashev, *Sanine* (1931) 218\n\nCather, *Death Comes for the Archbishop* (1931) 219\n\nCorvo, *History of the Borgias* (1931) 220\n\nBalzac, *Droll Stories* (1931) 221\n\nCorneille and Racine, *Six Plays* (1931) 222\n\nMcFee, *Casuals of the Sea* (1931) 223\n\nPolo, *Travels of Marco Polo* (1931) 224\n\nWells, *Tono-Bungay* (1931) 225\n\nMcDermott, ed., *Sex Problem in Modern Society* (1931) 226\n\nMerejkowski, *Peter and Alexis* (1931) 227\n\n\\**The Counterfeiters* was discontinued in fall 1946 and restored to the\nML in 1962 when it was published in one volume with Gide’s *Journal of\nThe Counterfeiters*.\n\n### Discontinued\n\nBrown, *House With the Green Shutters* (1927)\n\nGoncourt, *Renée Maupérin* (1919)\n\nHauptmann, *Heretic of Soana* (1928)\n\nKipling, *Soldiers Three* (1917)\n\nMorrison, *Tales of Mean Streets* (1921)\n\n***  \nSpring***\n\n### 207\n\n**ARNOLD BENNETT.

The ML had\nexclusive reprint rights to *The Old Wives’ Tale* and paid Doubleday,\nDoran a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a\nsecond printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of\n3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in\n1933.

ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February\n1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded\n1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).\n\nCerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that *The Decameron*\nwould not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of\noccasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its\nimportation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A.\nFalk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who\nindicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include\nshocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).\n\nThe ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to\nJohn S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of\nVice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of *The\nDecameron*, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American\nuniversities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He\nstated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p.\nxxii).\n\nCerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously,\nbut Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed\nforeword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our\nfriend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I\nrather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors,\nmight shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27\nDecember 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the\ntitle page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees.\nCerf assured booksellers in an article in *PW* that the Payne\ntranslation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying\nthe sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of\npublic morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW*\n119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).\n\nSumner did not challenge the ML edition, but *The Decameron* remained a\ncontroversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who\nspecialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML\njacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any\ntitle at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the\nDROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales\nrepresentative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of\ntitles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked\nLewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised:\n“Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern\nmaidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a\nstink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).\n\n*The Decameron* was the best-selling ML title during the first six\nmonths of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nfirst quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position\nin the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower\nthan in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 209.1b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nTHE | DECAMERON | OF | GIOVANNI | BOCCACCIO | TRANSLATED BY | JOHN PAYNE\n| \\[torchbearer D3 at right; 3-line imprint at left\\] THE | MODERN\nLIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xxii, \\[1–2\\] 3–830 \\[831–842\\]. \\[1–27\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 209.1a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] publication and\nmanufacturing statements within single rules; \\[831–836\\] ML list;\n\\[837–838\\] ML Giants list; \\[839–842\\] blank.

Published February 1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.\n\n*Lord Jim* was the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the\nML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML\npaid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\nThe Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included\nCanadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights\nwhen they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers\nwhen they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the\nMacmillan Co. of Canada, sold *Lord Jim* for five months before\nBlackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the\ntransgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped\nselling *Lord Jim* in Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian\nsales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards”\n(Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to\nLongwell, 4 September 1931).\n\n*Lord Jim* sold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant\ntitles. Conrad’s *Victory* (238) sold 7,335 copies during the same\nperiod. Sales of *Lord Jim* totaled 115,000 copies by 1949.

Front flap as jacket A.\n(*Spring 1938*)\n\nPrivately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade\nedition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s\ndeath. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927\nand reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates.\nPublished March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1978/79.\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was one of the first titles Cerf tried to\nget after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original\nedition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a\nreprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August\n1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint.\nCerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of\nthe original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told\nHoughton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be\ntaken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife,\nHoughton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin\nhad reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It\nwill be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very\nproud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).\n\nHe offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two\ncents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for\nnonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930;\nCerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf\ndid not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the\none-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin\nreduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s\nto 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for\nwriting the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).\n\nScaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library\nedition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the\nplates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April\n1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid\n1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.\n\nLater in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of *The\nEducation of Henry Adams* in the format of the new ML Giants series.\nAround the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special\nprinting of Young’s *The Medici* in the same format that had been made\nfor Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of\nthe first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the\npublisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500\neach and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was the thirteenth best-selling ML title\nduring the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It\nsold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October\n1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nDuring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed\ninto the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782\ncopies.\n\n#### 211b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nTHE EDUCATION | OF | HENRY ADAMS | BY HENRY ADAMS | INTRODUCTION BY |\nJAMES TRUSLOW ADAMS | \\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at\nleft\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–v\\] vi–x, \\[v\\] vi–x, \\[1–3\\] 4–517 \\[518–528\\].\n\\[1–17\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 211a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1918, | BY THE\nMASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY | COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE MODERN\nLIBRARY, INC.; \\[518\\] blank; \\[519–523\\] ML list; \\[524–525\\] ML Giants\nlist; \\[526–528\\] blank.

Publication was announced for August\n1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so\ngreat,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to\nbring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to\nHugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML\nwrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new\nprinting they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had\nbeen sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged\nwith Lippincott.\n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett\nand Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished\nafter the United States entered the Second World War. *Parnassus on\nWheels* sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley\nwas the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling\ntitles—and he had two books in that category. *Human Being* (334), which\nlasted just over five years in the series, outsold *Parnassus on Wheels*\nby nearly 300 copies.\n\n#### 213b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nPARNASSUS | ON | WHEELS | *by* | Christopher Morley | \\[torchbearer D3\\]\n| \\[rule\\] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPagination as 213a. \\[1–12\\]<sup>8</sup> \\[13\\]<sup>4</sup>\n\nContents as 213a variant except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[*4*\\] COPYRIGHT, 1917,\n1925, BY DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & CO.; \\[191–195\\] ML list; \\[196\\] blank.\n(*Spring 1942*)\n\n*Jacket:* Enlarged version of 213a in light grayish green (154) in place\nof pale purplish blue and with borders omitted.

In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her\n> spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose\n> of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for\n> truth so evident in her life and work. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–255) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1931. *WR* 2 May\n1931. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint\ncontract with Knopf in October 1929 for *The Dove’s Nest*, paying a $500\nadvance. *The Garden Party* was not considered because an inexpensive\nreprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML\nbought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to\ncancel the contract for *The Dove’s Nest* so that the ML could include\nthe more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The\nroyalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when\nthe ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June\n1947).\n\n*The Garden Party* had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There\nwere printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938,\n1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an\nadditional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies\nduring the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June\n1938). *The Garden Party* sold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles.\nIt was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern\nLibrary during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 214b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\n\\[torchbearer E3\\] | \\[6-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin single rules\\] THE | GARDEN | PARTY | BY | KATHERINE | MANSFIELD\n| \\[below frame\\] MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[*8*\\], 1–255 \\[256–264\\]. \\[1–8\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[9\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 214a except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[*4*\\] COPYRIGHT, 1922, BY\nALFRED A.

Discontinued fall\n1946. *The Counterfeiters* with *Journal of the Counterfeiters*\npublished spring 1962 (see 216.2).\n\nCerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition of *The\nCounterfeiters*, offering a $700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a\ncopy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a\ncopy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was\nintended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf,\n18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x\n4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.\n\nKnopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication\ndate was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the\nfollowing year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s *Lafcadio’s\nAdventures*, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in\nspring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for *The Counterfeiters* (Knopf\nto Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the\nfinal reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably\nsimilar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for\nrenewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep *The\nCounterfeiters* in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any\nspectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to\nKnopf, 24 October 1939).\n\n*The Counterfeiters* sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant sales.\n\n#### 216.1b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nThe Counterfeiters | LES FAUX-MONNAYEURS | by André Gide | *Translated\nfrom the French by* DOROTHY BUSSY | *Introduction by* RAYMOND WEAVER |\n\\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at left\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY\n| NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xx, \\[1–2\\] 3–372 \\[373–380\\]. \\[1–12\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\\[13\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 216.1a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] INTRODUCTION COPYRIGHT,\n1931, | BY THE MODERN LIBRARY, INC. | COPYRIGHT, 1927, BY ALFRED A.\nKNOPF, INC.; \\[373–377\\] ML list; \\[378–380\\] blank.

ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published July 1931. *WR* 15 August 1931. First (and only)\nprinting: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.\n\nThe ML paid Viking an $800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy.\nThe ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large\nfor its format.\n\nSales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other\nadvance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six\nmonths of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to\ncompetition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger\nthan the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in\n1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches\ntaller than the ML edition.\n\nThe ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press\nowned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act\nrestricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the\nU.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine*\nirretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the\nunauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold\nGuinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be\nmade. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and\nwould not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf\nsuggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was\nentirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance\nhad been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton\ntranslation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s\nshoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates\n(Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates,\nand Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold\ncopies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).\n\n***Fall***\n\n### 219\n\n**WILLA CATHER.

This historical chronicle of the apostolic\n> mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and\n> Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity.

(*Spring\n> 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published\nSeptember 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.\n\nWilla Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to\ninclude in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright.\nCerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s *My\nÁntonia* or *The Song of the Lark*, offering royalties of eight cents a\ncopy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who\nwas then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they\napproached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of *Death Comes for the\nArchbishop*, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.\nThe advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh\nEayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML\nprintings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies\n(December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934),\n5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the\nML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows:\n14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910\ncopies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nAfter the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want\nany of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked\nKnopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of\nthe contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock\nafter the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf,\nindicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September\n25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:\n\n> In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so\n> much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do\n> is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH\n> COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It\n> seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather,\n> and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep\n> the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will\n> undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other\n> alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th\n> of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would\n> probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder\n> price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell\n> out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the\n> book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the\n> most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the\n> contract?\n>\n> . . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give\n> up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett\n> and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to\n> renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss\n> Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to\n> say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).\n\nKnopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from\nher point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June\n1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. *Death*\n*Comes* *for* *the* *Archbishop* was listed in the ML’s spring 1937\ncatalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to\nEayrs, 28 May 1937).\n\nIn 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had\nacquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, published *Death Comes for the\nArchbishop* in its paperback series Vintage Books.\n\n**219.2.** **Reissue format (1984)**\n\nWILLA CATHER | \\[2-line title in reverse within single rules in reverse\nall on black rectangular panel\\] DEATH COMES FOR | THE ARCHBISHOP |\n\\[below panel: torchbearer N\\] | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[*10*\\], \\[1–2\\] 3–299 \\[300–302\\].

The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe,\n> using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its\n> surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has\n> succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the\n> New Mexican way of life.\n>\n> “There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly\n> quiet narrative.

Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a\n> new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama\n> of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against\n> the forces of nature and man’s will. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916. ML edition\nprinted from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new\ntypesetting. Published November 1931. *WR* 5 December 1931. First\nprinting: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.\n\nCerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in\nJanuary 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly\ninterested in *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, but McFee appears to have\nbeen opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf\ninvited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s *Purple Land* (134)\nand indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the\npossibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26\nAugust 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,\n*Casuals of the Sea* and *Command*, were in the Sun Dial Library, which\nthe ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday\nreprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both\nnovels, but in the end only *Casuals of the Sea* was added.\n\nMorley’s introduction to *Casuals of the Sea* was originally for the\nLambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.\n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when\nthere was a printing of 1,000 copies.\n\n*Casuals of the Sea* sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945.\nIt was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during\nthe twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\nWhen Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition of *Command* in 1933, Cerf\nresponded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book,\nbut \\[it\\] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished\nsomewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de\nGraff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In\n1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in *Casuals of the Sea* to\nMcFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with\nMcFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to\nbe applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the\nplates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).\n\n#### 223b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\n\\[torchbearer E3\\] | \\[7-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin single rules\\] CASUALS | OF | THE SEA | BY | WILLIAM M<span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">c</span>FEE | WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY | CHRISTOPHER\nMORLEY | \\[below frame\\] THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xvi \\[xvii–xviii\\], \\[1–2\\] 3–513 \\[514–518\\].\n\\[1–16\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[17\\]<sup>12</sup>\n\nContents as 223a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE\nMODERN LIBRARY, INC.; \\[514–518\\] blank.

Annual ML\nsales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for\nSeptember 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s\nhistory up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of\nBooks,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).\n\nModern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to\ninclude works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to\naccommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in\nfall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1),\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3).\nThe Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm)\nwith hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the\nvolumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for\none dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were\nideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate\nsuccess.\n\nIn contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and\nKlopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint\ncollapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers\nfor their collections. One collector, whose library included a large\nnumber of Kelmscott Press books, including *The Works of Geoffrey\nChaucer*, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden\nCockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically\neverything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales\nrepresentatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was\nasked for suggestions, he could only reply, “I don’t know a soul who\nwants to buy a lot of press books today” (Carl Smalley to Cerf and\nKlopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933\nRandom House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of\nthe original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells’s *Time\nMachine* designed by W. A. Dwiggins ($12.50 list) was available for\n$2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne ($42.00 list)\nwas reduced to $10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides\n($85.00 list) was $15.00.\n\nCerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under\nthe Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for “specials”\nintended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML\nplates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on\ngood quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt\ntops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of $2.50. The\nventure was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title\nwere printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in\nmajor cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did\nnot do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that\nthey would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nRH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but\nthe books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML\nplates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50\ncents.",
  "numberOfTitles": "Twenty-one titles were added to the regular ML in 1931 and five were\ndiscontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 198. Minor\ndiscrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on inside\npanels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including\ntitles projected for January publication on fall lists. The new ML\nGiants series was introduced in fall 1931 with three titles: Tolstoy,\n*War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo,\n*Les Misérables* (G3).",
  "format": "All new titles except Conrad, *Lord Jim* (230) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Lord Jim* was 6⅞\nx 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm) with the leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in. (171 x\n113 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).",

Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTwelve of the 1931 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets.

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Cerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* in the ML, possibly as a\nreplacement for *Soldiers* *Three* which was dropped from the series in\n1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran\nwas not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17\nFebruary 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson\nDoubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. *Kim* (433) did not\nappear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams,\n*Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres*, the trade edition of which was\noriginally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there\nwas very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced\nedition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931).\nHerschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co.,\nasked why Gogol’s *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead\nSouls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to\nit. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf,\nundated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). *Dead Souls* (290) was\npublished in the ML in 1936.\n\nCerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur\nSchnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a\npotential replacement for Schnitzler’s novel *Bertha Garlan* (38) which\nwas discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a\ncollection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title *Little Novels* in\n1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or\nCerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* (256), published in April 1933, he included\nSchnitzler’s story “The Fate of the Baron” from the Simon and Schuster\ncollection.\n\nCerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon’s *Memoirs of a Fox Hunting\nMan*, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was\ninterested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML’s format,\nand he had reservations about Sassoon’s popularity in the United States.\nHe eventually declined: “Maybe something will come along to increase\nSassoon’s popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will\nallow us to reopen negotiations on this book” (Cerf to Coward, 10\nFebruary 1931; 9 July 1931).\n\nR. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested *Wolfgang Goethe*, a\ntwo-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML\nGiants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied,\n“Cheers! What a <u>lousy</u> idea” (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931;\nunderlining in original).\n\nWhen M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion\nof a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, “I have the very definite\nfeeling that ed. & Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of\nthe reprints of Mr. Bromfield’s books” (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October\n1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar & Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell’s\n*Moon-Calf*, *The Briary-Bush*, or *Janet March*, which were then the\nproperty of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, “I frankly don’t think\nthat Dell’s old books are read widely enough today to justify their\ninclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be\nbelonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I\nwrong?” (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22\nDecember 1931).",

ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February\n1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded\n1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).\n\nCerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that *The Decameron*\nwould not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of\noccasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its\nimportation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A.\nFalk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who\nindicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include\nshocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).\n\nThe ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to\nJohn S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of\nVice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of *The\nDecameron*, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American\nuniversities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He\nstated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p.\nxxii).\n\nCerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously,\nbut Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed\nforeword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our\nfriend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I\nrather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors,\nmight shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27\nDecember 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the\ntitle page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees.\nCerf assured booksellers in an article in *PW* that the Payne\ntranslation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying\nthe sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of\npublic morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW*\n119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).\n\nSumner did not challenge the ML edition, but *The Decameron* remained a\ncontroversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who\nspecialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML\njacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any\ntitle at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the\nDROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales\nrepresentative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of\ntitles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked\nLewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised:\n“Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern\nmaidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a\nstink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).\n\n*The Decameron* was the best-selling ML title during the first six\nmonths of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nfirst quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position\nin the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower\nthan in the 1940s.

The ML\npaid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\nThe Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included\nCanadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights\nwhen they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers\nwhen they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the\nMacmillan Co. of Canada, sold *Lord Jim* for five months before\nBlackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the\ntransgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped\nselling *Lord Jim* in Canada.

Front flap as jacket A.\n(*Spring 1938*)\n\nPrivately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade\nedition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s\ndeath. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927\nand reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates.\nPublished March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1978/79.\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was one of the first titles Cerf tried to\nget after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original\nedition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a\nreprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August\n1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint.\nCerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of\nthe original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told\nHoughton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be\ntaken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife,\nHoughton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin\nhad reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It\nwill be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very\nproud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).\n\nHe offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two\ncents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for\nnonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930;\nCerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf\ndid not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the\none-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin\nreduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s\nto 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for\nwriting the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).\n\nScaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library\nedition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the\nplates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April\n1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid\n1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.\n\nLater in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of *The\nEducation of Henry Adams* in the format of the new ML Giants series.\nAround the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special\nprinting of Young’s *The Medici* in the same format that had been made\nfor Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of\nthe first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the\npublisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500\neach and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was the thirteenth best-selling ML title\nduring the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It\nsold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October\n1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nDuring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed\ninto the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782\ncopies.\n\n#### 211b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nTHE EDUCATION | OF | HENRY ADAMS | BY HENRY ADAMS | INTRODUCTION BY |\nJAMES TRUSLOW ADAMS | \\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at\nleft\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–v\\] vi–x, \\[v\\] vi–x, \\[1–3\\] 4–517 \\[518–528\\].\n\\[1–17\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 211a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1918, | BY THE\nMASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY | COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE MODERN\nLIBRARY, INC.; \\[518\\] blank; \\[519–523\\] ML list; \\[524–525\\] ML Giants\nlist; \\[526–528\\] blank.

Subsequent ML printings were arranged\nwith Lippincott.\n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett\nand Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished\nafter the United States entered the Second World War. *Parnassus on\nWheels* sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley\nwas the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling\ntitles—and he had two books in that category. *Human Being* (334), which\nlasted just over five years in the series, outsold *Parnassus on Wheels*\nby nearly 300 copies.\n\n#### 213b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nPARNASSUS | ON | WHEELS | *by* | Christopher Morley | \\[torchbearer D3\\]\n| \\[rule\\] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPagination as 213a. \\[1–12\\]<sup>8</sup> \\[13\\]<sup>4</sup>\n\nContents as 213a variant except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[*4*\\] COPYRIGHT, 1917,\n1925, BY DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & CO.; \\[191–195\\] ML list; \\[196\\] blank.\n(*Spring 1942*)\n\n*Jacket:* Enlarged version of 213a in light grayish green (154) in place\nof pale purplish blue and with borders omitted.

They have been selected with the purpose\n> of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for\n> truth so evident in her life and work. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–255) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1931. *WR* 2 May\n1931. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint\ncontract with Knopf in October 1929 for *The Dove’s Nest*, paying a $500\nadvance. *The Garden Party* was not considered because an inexpensive\nreprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML\nbought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to\ncancel the contract for *The Dove’s Nest* so that the ML could include\nthe more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The\nroyalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when\nthe ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June\n1947).\n\n*The Garden Party* had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There\nwere printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938,\n1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an\nadditional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies\nduring the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June\n1938). *The Garden Party* sold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles.\nIt was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern\nLibrary during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 214b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\n\\[torchbearer E3\\] | \\[6-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin single rules\\] THE | GARDEN | PARTY | BY | KATHERINE | MANSFIELD\n| \\[below frame\\] MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[*8*\\], 1–255 \\[256–264\\]. \\[1–8\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[9\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 214a except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[*4*\\] COPYRIGHT, 1922, BY\nALFRED A.

The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was\nintended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf,\n18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x\n4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.\n\nKnopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication\ndate was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the\nfollowing year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s *Lafcadio’s\nAdventures*, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in\nspring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for *The Counterfeiters* (Knopf\nto Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the\nfinal reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably\nsimilar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for\nrenewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep *The\nCounterfeiters* in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any\nspectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to\nKnopf, 24 October 1939).\n\n*The Counterfeiters* sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant sales.\n\n#### 216.1b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nThe Counterfeiters | LES FAUX-MONNAYEURS | by André Gide | *Translated\nfrom the French by* DOROTHY BUSSY | *Introduction by* RAYMOND WEAVER |\n\\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at left\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY\n| NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xx, \\[1–2\\] 3–372 \\[373–380\\]. \\[1–12\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\\[13\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 216.1a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] INTRODUCTION COPYRIGHT,\n1931, | BY THE MODERN LIBRARY, INC. | COPYRIGHT, 1927, BY ALFRED A.\nKNOPF, INC.; \\[373–377\\] ML list; \\[378–380\\] blank.

ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published July 1931. *WR* 15 August 1931. First (and only)\nprinting: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.\n\nThe ML paid Viking an $800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy.\nThe ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large\nfor its format.\n\nSales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other\nadvance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six\nmonths of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to\ncompetition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger\nthan the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in\n1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches\ntaller than the ML edition.\n\nThe ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press\nowned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act\nrestricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the\nU.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine*\nirretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the\nunauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold\nGuinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be\nmade. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and\nwould not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf\nsuggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was\nentirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance\nhad been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton\ntranslation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s\nshoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates\n(Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates,\nand Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold\ncopies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).\n\n***Fall***"

This historical chronicle of the apostolic\n> mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and\n> Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity.

(*Spring\n> 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published\nSeptember 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.\n\nWilla Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to\ninclude in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright.\nCerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s *My\nÁntonia* or *The Song of the Lark*, offering royalties of eight cents a\ncopy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who\nwas then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they\napproached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of *Death Comes for the\nArchbishop*, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.\nThe advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh\nEayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML\nprintings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies\n(December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934),\n5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the\nML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows:\n14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910\ncopies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nAfter the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want\nany of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked\nKnopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of\nthe contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock\nafter the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf,\nindicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September\n25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:\n\n> In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so\n> much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do\n> is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH\n> COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It\n> seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather,\n> and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep\n> the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will\n> undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other\n> alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th\n> of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would\n> probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder\n> price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell\n> out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the\n> book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the\n> most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the\n> contract?\n>\n> . . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give\n> up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett\n> and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to\n> renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss\n> Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to\n> say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).\n\nKnopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from\nher point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June\n1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. *Death*\n*Comes* *for* *the* *Archbishop* was listed in the ML’s spring 1937\ncatalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to\nEayrs, 28 May 1937).\n\nIn 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had\nacquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, published *Death Comes for the\nArchbishop* in its paperback series Vintage Books.\n\n**219.2.** **Reissue format (1984)**\n\nWILLA CATHER | \\[2-line title in reverse within single rules in reverse\nall on black rectangular panel\\] DEATH COMES FOR | THE ARCHBISHOP |\n\\[below panel: torchbearer N\\] | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[*10*\\], \\[1–2\\] 3–299 \\[300–302\\].

Slowly and firmly he gains control of the\n> padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men\n> stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe,\n> using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its\n> surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has\n> succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the\n> New Mexican way of life.\n>\n> “There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly\n> quiet narrative. It is a severe, purely designed chalice of handbeaten\n> silver, filled to the brim with the white essential wine of\n> love. . . .” — *Saturday Review*\n\nNew bibliographical edition published by Knopf, 1945.

Discontinued 1 January 1954.\n\nCerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in\nJanuary 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly\ninterested in *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, but McFee appears to have\nbeen opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf\ninvited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s *Purple Land* (134)\nand indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the\npossibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26\nAugust 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,\n*Casuals of the Sea* and *Command*, were in the Sun Dial Library, which\nthe ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday\nreprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both\nnovels, but in the end only *Casuals of the Sea* was added.\n\nMorley’s introduction to *Casuals of the Sea* was originally for the\nLambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.\n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when\nthere was a printing of 1,000 copies.\n\n*Casuals of the Sea* sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.

In\n1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in *Casuals of the Sea* to\nMcFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with\nMcFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to\nbe applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the\nplates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).\n\n#### 223b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\n\\[torchbearer E3\\] | \\[7-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin single rules\\] CASUALS | OF | THE SEA | BY | WILLIAM M<span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">c</span>FEE | WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY | CHRISTOPHER\nMORLEY | \\[below frame\\] THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xvi \\[xvii–xviii\\], \\[1–2\\] 3–513 \\[514–518\\].\n\\[1–16\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[17\\]<sup>12</sup>\n\nContents as 223a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE\nMODERN LIBRARY, INC.; \\[514–518\\] blank.

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1931 1931 It took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest\nlevels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales\nfluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears\nto have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream\nbooks sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML\nsales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for\nSeptember 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s\nhistory up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of\nBooks,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).\n\nModern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to\ninclude works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to\naccommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in\nfall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1),\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3).\nThe Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm)\nwith hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the\nvolumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for\none dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were\nideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate\nsuccess.\n\nIn contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and\nKlopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint\ncollapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers\nfor their collections. One collector, whose library included a large\nnumber of Kelmscott Press books, including *The Works of Geoffrey\nChaucer*, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden\nCockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically\neverything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales\nrepresentatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was\nasked for suggestions, he could only reply, “I don’t know a soul who\nwants to buy a lot of press books today” (Carl Smalley to Cerf and\nKlopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933\nRandom House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of\nthe original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells’s *Time\nMachine* designed by W. A. Dwiggins ($12.50 list) was available for\n$2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne ($42.00 list)\nwas reduced to $10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides\n($85.00 list) was $15.00.\n\nCerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under\nthe Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for “specials”\nintended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML\nplates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on\ngood quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt\ntops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of $2.50. The\nventure was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title\nwere printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in\nmajor cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did\nnot do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that\nthey would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nRH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but\nthe books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML\nplates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50\ncents. Twenty-one titles were added to the regular ML in 1931 and five were\ndiscontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 198. Minor\ndiscrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on inside\npanels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including\ntitles projected for January publication on fall lists. The new ML\nGiants series was introduced in fall 1931 with three titles: Tolstoy,\n*War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo,\n*Les Misérables* (G3). All new titles except Conrad, *Lord Jim* (230) were published in the\nstandard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm)\nand the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Lord Jim* was 6⅞\nx 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm) with the leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in. (171 x\n113 mm).\n\nThe ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured\n7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120\nmm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the\nbinding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½\nin. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.\n\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the\nsheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most\nbooks were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and\nbound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with\nthe title in open-face type and torchbearer A2, A3, or A6 (see\nindividual entries). Beginning in January 1931 Cerf and Klopfer added\ntheir names to the imprint:\n\nBENNETT A. CERF · DONALD S. KLOPFER\n\nT H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe imprints of three 1931 titles—Fielding, *History of Tom Jones*\n(208), Boccaccio, *Decameron* (209), and Balzac, *Droll Stories*\n(221)—differed from the standard format. *The History of Tom Jones* had\na colon instead of a dot between Cerf and Klopfer’s names; *The\nDecameron* and *Droll Stories* reverted to the two-line format without\nCerf and Klopfer’s names.\n\nThe imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line\nformat in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing\nfirm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and\nKlopfer as partners. Balloon cloth binding C, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped\nin gold on the front panel and the 2-line imprint MODERN LIBRARY stamped\nin gold at the base of the spine, was used through April 1931. Balloon\ncloth binding D, with the front panel as binding C and the stylized\ninitials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine, was\nintroduced in May and remained in use through spring 1939.\n\nBalloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red,\nblue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all\nfour bindings.\n\nThe Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation, which supplied some or all of the\nML’s balloon cloth, decided to liquidate. Holliston Mills, Inc., took\nover Siegbert’s stock, trademarks, and patent rights. Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange\nendpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930\nthrough spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were\npublished in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles\nbeginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was\nintroduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s\ntorchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books\nand “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTwelve of the 1931 titles were published in individually designed\npictorial jackets. Five were published in uniform typographic jacket D\nand three in uniform typographic jacket E. The individually designed\njacket of Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225) features the 2-line title\nsandwiched between six strong yellow green bands, simulating a barrel\nlabeled TONO BUNGAY. 95 cents. (Spring) Conrad, *Lord Jim* xBalzac, *Droll Stories*. (Fall) Balzac,\n*Droll Stories* xDreiser, *Sister Carrie*; Giants through G3. Cerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* in the ML, possibly as a\nreplacement for *Soldiers* *Three* which was dropped from the series in\n1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran\nwas not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17\nFebruary 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson\nDoubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. *Kim* (433) did not\nappear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams,\n*Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres*, the trade edition of which was\noriginally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there\nwas very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced\nedition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931).\nHerschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co.,\nasked why Gogol’s *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead\nSouls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to\nit. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf,\nundated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). *Dead Souls* (290) was\npublished in the ML in 1936.\n\nCerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur\nSchnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a\npotential replacement for Schnitzler’s novel *Bertha Garlan* (38) which\nwas discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a\ncollection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title *Little Novels* in\n1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or\nCerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* (256), published in April 1933, he included\nSchnitzler’s story “The Fate of the Baron” from the Simon and Schuster\ncollection.\n\nCerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon’s *Memoirs of a Fox Hunting\nMan*, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was\ninterested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML’s format,\nand he had reservations about Sassoon’s popularity in the United States.\nHe eventually declined: “Maybe something will come along to increase\nSassoon’s popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will\nallow us to reopen negotiations on this book” (Cerf to Coward, 10\nFebruary 1931; 9 July 1931).\n\nR. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested *Wolfgang Goethe*, a\ntwo-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML\nGiants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied,\n“Cheers! What a <u>lousy</u> idea” (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931;\nunderlining in original).\n\nWhen M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion\nof a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, “I have the very definite\nfeeling that ed. & Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of\nthe reprints of Mr. Bromfield’s books” (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October\n1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar & Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell’s\n*Moon-Calf*, *The Briary-Bush*, or *Janet March*, which were then the\nproperty of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, “I frankly don’t think\nthat Dell’s old books are read widely enough today to justify their\ninclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be\nbelonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I\nwrong?” (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22\nDecember 1931).

Brown, *House With the Green Shutters* (1927)\n\nGoncourt, *Renée Maupérin* (1919)\n\nHauptmann, *Heretic of Soana* (1928)\n\nKipling, *Soldiers Three* (1917)\n\nMorrison, *Tales of Mean Streets* (1921)\n\n***  \nSpring*** It took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest\nlevels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales\nfluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears\nto have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream\nbooks sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML\nsales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for\nSeptember 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s\nhistory up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of\nBooks,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).
