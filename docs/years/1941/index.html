<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1941</h1>
<h2>1941</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The last title added in 1941, Pascal’s <em>Pensées &amp; The Provincial
Letters</em> (345), was published a month before the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor. The next four years would be difficult, as publishers
struggled with a huge increase in demand for books coupled with scarcity
of resources, including paper rationing, the absence of personnel who
served in the armed services, and other dislocations caused by the war.
The end of the war in August 1945 was accompanied by rapid inflation and
a wave of strikes that disrupted the return to a peacetime economy. It
would be September 1948 before the Modern Library could announce, “Every
title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now back in
stock for the first time since the war” (Modern Library advertisement,
<em>Publishers’ Weekly</em>, September 17, 1948, p. 1095).</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Ten titles were added to the ML and ten were discontinued. The number of
titles in the series remained at 219, the same as in 1940.</p>
<h3>Title page</h3>
<p>Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by
Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He
created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and
making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer.</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format
was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used
smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or
gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the
spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black
or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of
green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were
usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a
single color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover
were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was
stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front
cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within
which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold.</p>
<h3>Endpaper</h3>
<p>The enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the
ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through
spring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers
featured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by a pattern of open books and
“ml” initials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through
spring 1966.</p>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>Two 1941 titles (Saroyan, <em>Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em> and
Bemelmans, <em>My War with the United States</em>) were originally published by
Random House; their ML jackets were adapted from the RH jackets. The
Saroyan jacket was designed by Ernest Reichl, and the jacket for <em>My War
with the United States</em> featured an adaptation of one of Bemelmans’s
illustrations.</p>
<p>The jacket for Steinbeck, <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> incorporated a
reproduction of Thomas Hart Benton’s lithograph “Departure of the Joads”
from his Grapes of Wrath series. Paul Galdone was responsible for three
jackets: Hugo, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> was an individually
designed pictorial jacket; <em>Five Great Modern Irish Plays</em> and Lardner,
<em>Collected Stories</em> featured a decorative non-pictorial design that was
used on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s.</p>
<p>Pascal, <em>Pensées &amp; The Provincial Letters</em>, had a typographic jacket
that was clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal. Three other
predominately typographic jackets were probably also by Blumenthal, who
signed none of his jackets. <em>The Federalist</em> featured a decorative image
of an American eagle, Proust’s <em>The Captive</em> had a small silhouette of
Proust in left profile that was also used on the other six titles of
<em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>, and Plato’s <em>Republic</em> had an inset
photographic image of a bust of Plato.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>95 cents.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Hugo, <em>Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> xBemelmans, <em>My War with the
United States</em>; Giants through G56; jackets: 271 (=spring 1940). (Fall)
Bemelmans, <em>My War with the United States</em> xLewis, <em>Babbitt</em>; Giants
through G58 with G20–21 Symonds, <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>; jackets: 278.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Cerf expressed interest in Ernest Hemingway’s <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>,
published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1940: “This is one book above
almost any other that has been written in the past five years that I’d
like to see on the Modern Library list when the time comes” (Cerf to Max
Perkins, 23 July 1941). The ML never secured reprint rights. In 1953
Scribner’s served notice that it was withdrawing all three Hemingway
titles in the ML—<em>The Sun Also Rises</em> (190), <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> (237),
and <em>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</em> (G59)—in order to publish
their own reprint editions in all English-speaking markets in North
America.</p>
<p>Conrad Aiken repeated his suggestion for a ML edition of his first
novel, <em>Blue Voyage</em>, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1927
(Aiken to Cerf, 19 May 1941). Aiken edited several poetry anthologies
for the ML, but he never had a book of his own in the series.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial on cream paper printed in grayish yellow green
(105) with title in ornamental lettering in deep orange (51), very dark
green (147), and moderate greenish blue (173); subtitle and author in
script lettering in very dark green and moderate greenish blue. Adapted
from Ernst Reichl’s jacket for the original RH edition. The original
jacket is signed “REICHL” in sans-serif capitals along the lower right
margin. The reduction in size of the ML jacket is achieved by cropping
the side and lower margins, resulting in the omission of his name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
When this volume first appeared in 1934 under the Random House
imprint, William Saroyan’s meteoric flight across the literary skies
was begun. For a book of short stories, it had an unprecedented
success and was an augury of his continuing national fame. Since then
William Saroyan has maintained his position among the foremost writers
of America. Winner of the Drama Critics Circle award and also winner,
but scorner, of the Pulitzer Prize for <em>The Time of Your Life</em>, he has
achieved quite as sensational a name for himself in the field of the
drama as in the short story. (<em>Spring 1941</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1934. ML edition (pp. [vii–x],
9–270) printed from RH plates with running heads removed to accommodate
the ML’s smaller format and with page numerals 7–8 removed from the
table of contents, which was revised to include Saroyan’s preface to the
ML edition. Published January 1941. <em>WR</em> 25 January 1941. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948.</p>
<p><em>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em> was one of the first trade
titles published by Random House. Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to
design trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the
plates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such
as the removal of running heads.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May
1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML
titles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the
ML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was
out of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print
and that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to
Saroyan, 5 April 1949).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The perennial success of <em>Les Miserables</em> in the Modern Library has
induced the editors to add Victor Hugo’s companion masterpiece, <em>The
Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, to the series. Adult readers of every taste
and opinion turn back to these monumental novels of the Romantic
School for escape [+and excitement] and solace, and new generations
receive their first introduction to the world of good books by the
discovery of such [+pulse-quickening] novels as <em>The Hunchback of
Notre Dame</em>. Young and old are rewarded by a story that stirs the
heart and kindles the imagination. (<em>Spring 1941; [Fall 1953]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. and
other publishers. ML edition (pp. [5]–416) printed from Burt plates
with the table of contents reset. Published January 1941. <em>WR</em> 25
January 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on
the first printing of Hugo’s <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> (1831) and does not
include three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in
December 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and
Book Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation
used by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and
Book Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and
5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not
“augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The
three added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been
misplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be
included in the 1832 printing (Hugo, <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em>, translated
and edited by John Sturrock [London: Penguin Books, 2004], pp. 26–29).</p>
<p>The absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill
That), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the
printing press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the
public expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during
the world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan
pagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of
the human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious
symbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own
monument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191).</p>
<p>When the ML reprinted <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> in 1996 as part of
the “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous
and incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and
1971.</p>
<p><em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> sold 4,004 copies during the 18-month
period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter
of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling
titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November
1951–October 1952. Hugo’s <em>Les Misérables</em> (G3) was in first quarter of
ML titles at both periods.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
For every American who is eager to know the fundamental principles
upon which the Government of the United States was established, the
first source is <em>The Federalist</em>. These essays by Hamilton, Jay and
Madison provided the arguments which persuaded the Founding Fathers to
adopt the Constitution. They are required reading for an understanding
of the ideal of representative government, now facing its most
critical challenge in the one hundred and fifty years of America’s
independence. By giving <em>The Federalist</em> the widest possible
distribution at a cost within everybody’s purse, the Modern Library
helps to explain the origins of our government to our people. (<em>Spring
1941</em>)</p>

<p>Sesquicentennial Edition published by National Home Library Foundation,
1938. ML edition (pp. v–618) printed from National Home Library
Foundation plates. Published January 1941. <em>WR</em> 25 January 1941. First
printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The ML presented the National Home Library Foundation with a complete
set of ML books in print in exchange for the free use of its plates. The
first printing of the ML edition failed to acknowledge the Foundation.
It included instead the following statement, adapted from the National
Home Library Foundation edition: “Acknowledgment is made, with thanks,
for the aid received from the <em>Carnegie Corporation of New York</em> in
making possible this edition of <em>The Federalist</em>” (p. [iv]). The ML
removed the title leaf of remaining copies of the first printing and
tipped in a new title leaf which acknowledged the National Home Library
Foundation on the verso (338a<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,782 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,
placing it low in the first quarter of ML titles. It sold 4,330 copies
during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, retaining its
place in the first quarter of ML titles.</p>

<p>Sherman F. Mittell of the National Home Library Foundation informed
Klopfer shortly after publication that the ML should have thanked the
Foundation and that the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation
would have to be removed. Klopfer agreed to rip the title leaf out of
every copy in stock and tip in a corrected leaf with the acknowledgment,
“The publishers are indebted to the National Home Library Foundation for
making this edition possible and wish to thank them for the courtesy
extended in the use of their plates” (Klopfer to Mittell, 27 February
1941; Mittell to Klopfer, 4 March 1941). A sizable portion of the first
printing appears to have been distributed before the cancellation and
replacement of the title leaf. Copies of 338a<sub>2</sub> are notably
harder to find than copies of 338a<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>After Mittell’s death in 1942 his widow offered to sell the National
Home Library Foundation plates to the ML. Cerf offered $250, then raised
his offer to $350 (Cerf to Fanny Mittell, 10 August 1942). The offer
appears to have been accepted. In 1960 Jason Epstein reported that the
ML paid no royalty and owned the plates free and clear but still showed
practically no profit per copy (Epstein to Willard A. Lockwood, 24 May
1960).</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in strong yellowish green (131), gold and light
yellow (86) on coated white paper with lettering in reverse on inset
panel in strong yellowish green and three strong yellowish green below
the inset panel, all surrounded by white background with decorations in
gold and yellow. Designed by Paul Galdone in December 1940; unsigned.
The jacket design in different color combinations was also used for
<em>Collected Short Stories</em> <em>of Ring Lardner</em> (1941: 344), <em>Collected
Stories of Dorothy Parker</em> (1942: 353), and four existing ML
anthologies: <em>Best Ghost Stories</em> (1919: 67b), <em>Best American Humorous

and <em>Great German Short Novels and Stories</em> (1933: 256b) when they
appeared in the ML’s larger format in the early 1940s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No nation has made a richer contribution to the recent literature of
the theatre than Ireland. Her playwrights have brought about a
renaissance of the drama in their own country and have earned the
world’s admiration. The plays in this volume represent the finest
flowering of the Irish genius in the drama, and include the complete
texts of <em>The Playboy of the Western World</em> and <em>Riders to the Sea</em> by
J. M. Synge, <em>Juno and the Paycock</em> by Sean O’Casey, <em>Spreading the
News</em> by Lady Gregory and <em>Shadow and Substance</em> by Paul Vincent
Carroll. George Jean Nathan provides a scintillating introduction.

<p>Original ML anthology. Published March 1941. <em>WR</em> 15 March 1941. First
printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The working title of the anthology when it was being planned was <em>Six
Great Modern Irish Plays</em>. Cerf wanted to include William Butler Yeats’s
one-act play, <em>Cathleen ni Houlihan</em>. He initially offered a flat fee of
$50 to include the play, then increased the offer to a $100 advance
against royalties of 1 percent of the list price. Mrs. Yeats did not
reply to his letters. The Synge estate granted permission to include
<em>The Playboy of the Western World</em> and <em>Riders to the Sea</em> for a $200
advance against a 2 percent royalty. The Synge estate received the
entire amount even though Random House, as Synge’s U.S. publisher, might
have claimed half of it; the advance exceeded the total 1939 royalties
for the RH edition of Synge’s <em>Complete Works</em> (Cerf to Denis Synge
Stephens, 15 October 1940). Lady Gregory’s <em>Spreading the News</em> was
obtained for a flat fee of $25.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 3,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it high in the fourth quarter of ML titles.
It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML
during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
No novel of our own time more certainly deserves the permanence
assured by inclusion in the Modern Library series than <em>The Grapes of
Wrath</em>. Universally hailed for its humanity and its power, this
odyssey of the Okies will long remain not only a fiery social
document, but will also endure as a magnificent work of literature.
<em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> is the fourth John Steinbeck novel on the Modern
Library shelf; the others are: <em>Tortilla Flat</em> (No. 216), <em>Of Mice and

Hailed for its humanity and power, this odyssey of the Okies as they
took flight westward from their dust-ruined land will long remain an
important social document. As a fictional account of a migration
unique in American history, it will endure as a magnificent work of
literature. <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> is the novel by which John Steinbeck
achieved his greatest fame. It is one of four of his books on the
Modern Library shelf. The other three are <em>Tortilla Flat</em> (No. 216),
<em>Of Mice and Men</em> (No. 29) and <em>In Dubious Battle</em> (No. 115). (<em>Spring

<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1939. ML edition (pp. [<em>7</em>]–619)
printed from Viking plates. Published October 1941. <em>WR</em> 4 October 1941.
First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1959.</p>
<p>The Viking Press edition led the best-seller list in 1939 with sales of
300,000 copies (Hackett and Burke, p. 127). The ML paid Viking Press a
$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for non-exclusive
reprint rights. There was a ML printing of 2,000 copies in December
1942; later printings included 4,000 copies each in May 1943 and June
1944.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 9,495 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,
placing <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> in the middle of the first quarter of ML
and Giant titles. Sales declined to 3,964 copies during the 12-month
period November 1951–October 1952, placing it toward the bottom of the
first quarter of titles.</p>
<p>In Chapter 30 (the last chapter) of Viking Press printings, the number
of lines per page increases between the fifth printing (May 1939) and
ninth printing (September 1939). The first page of Chapter 30 (p. 593)
of the ninth printing has one more line than early printings; lines are
shifted forward throughout the chapter, with the result that the last
page of text (p. 619) has only four lines—five fewer than the fifth
printing. The reason for the shift has not been determined. The plates
used by the ML reflect the later configuration of Chapter 30.</p>
<p>The ML’s reprint contract appears to have been terminated in 1958 when
Viking Press published <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> in its quality paperback
series, Compass Books. The Modern Library edition was discontinued at
the end of 1959. Original publishers normally allowed the ML to sell out
its existing stock when a reprint contract was terminated.</p>

For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have planned to

The entire text of Plato’s <em>The Republic</em> in the Benjamin Jowett
translation is made available in the Modern Library series. At a time
when interest in government, local and national, is of critical
importance, the most famous of the Socratic dialogues offers guidance
in the principles under which man can live in amity with his
fellow-man. Now, just as it had four centuries before the Christian
era, Plato’s description of the ideal commonwealth has a special
timeliness; it outlines a pattern of government that free men can
follow with trust and conviction. This edition includes, in addition
to the complete and unabridged text, the Jowett references and
marginal notes. (<em>Fall 1957</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
No philosopher has had as profound an influence on the history of
Western thought as Plato, and perhaps no one work has shaped our
conception of the ideal society as much as Plato’s <em>Republic</em>. The
most important of the Socratic dialogues, the <em>Republic</em> is concerned
with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place
as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the
word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes
various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But
above all, the <em>Republic</em> is an attempt to define “justice”; by
imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to
see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows
himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.</p>
<p>The text used here is the classic Jowett translation, complete and
unabridged, with notes and marginalia for the student, scholar, and
general reader alike.</p>

Foreword; 11–151 text; [152–158] blank. <em>Note:</em> <em>First</em> statement
retained on all printings. The first printing is on thicker paper than
most of the later printings, and there is no list of titles inside the
jacket.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), moderate yellow
(87) and black on cream paper with drawing of a fort and cannon in black
and moderate greenish blue against moderate yellow background; lettering
in black except last two words of title in moderate greenish blue
outlined in black. Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition
with a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN
LIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot
of the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML
jacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the
Bemelmans drawing on the title page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own
foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ <em>My War with the United States</em> fulfils
that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It
persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American
Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and
wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its
illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and
civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a
reprint edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. [3],
[5]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the
Viking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published
October 1941. <em>WR</em> 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained.
Discontinued fall 1948.</p>
<p>The verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,
“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway
Printing Company Paper by Richard Bauer &amp; Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The
ML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset
department before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that
specialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its
standard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible
that Parkway subcontracted the job.</p>
<p>There are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a
ML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were
printed from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset
printing.</p>
<p>The jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and
the inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings
of the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring
1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so
they could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.</p>
<p>The ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl
Harbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings
are on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to
enhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset
lithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of
wartime paper shortages.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May
1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and
Giant titles.</p>

In his lifetime Ring Lardner was briefly described as a writer of
humorous dialect, a baseball satirist and generally a funny fellow.
This injustice to his reputation has been completely revised since his
death by a new estimate of his place among the world’s great
story–tellers. Now he is as much admired for his vigor and warmth and
unfailing sense of the dramatic as for his irrepressible humor. *The
Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner—*thirty-five in all—represent,
in John Chamberlain’s opinion, “The full measure of the talent of the
man who is pre-eminently our best short story writer.” (<em>Fall 1941</em>)</p>

November 1941. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.</p>
<p>The ML paid Scribner’s a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a
copy. Cerf had tried to get Lardner’s stories for the ML on several
occasions before Scribner’s agreed to a reprint edition. He noted in
spring 1941 when he requested permission to include the book in the
fall, “It is a glaring omission on our list and it has been commented on
so many times that I am getting tired of hearing it” (Cerf to Max
Perkins, 1 May 1941). There was a second printing of 4,000 copies in
March 1942 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in January 1943.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 7,800 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1
November 1943, placing it in the first quarter of regular ML and Giant
titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular

The two works upon which Pascal’s enduring fame rests are <em>Pensées</em>
and <em>The Provincial Letters</em>. Now, at last, they are made available,
as they always should have been, in a single, complete and unabridged
volume. One of the world’s greatest declarations of faith, <em>Pensées</em>
has given sustenance over a period of three hundred years to men of
inquiring minds who are assailed by doubt. Considered a masterpiece of
religious controversy, <em>The Provincial Letters</em> are the product of one
of the most unusual scientific intellects of all time applied to the
humane purpose of liberalizing religious doctrine. (<em>Fall 1941</em>)</p>

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe ML presented the National Home Library Foundation with a complete\nset of ML books in print in exchange for the free use of its plates. The\nfirst printing of the ML edition failed to acknowledge the Foundation.\nIt included instead the following statement, adapted from the National\nHome Library Foundation edition: “Acknowledgment is made, with thanks,\nfor the aid received from the *Carnegie Corporation of New York* in\nmaking possible this edition of *The Federalist*” (p. \\[iv\\]). The ML\nremoved the title leaf of remaining copies of the first printing and\ntipped in a new title leaf which acknowledged the National Home Library\nFoundation on the verso (338a<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,782 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing it low in the first quarter of ML titles.

(*Fall 1946*)\n\nSherman F. Mittell of the National Home Library Foundation informed\nKlopfer shortly after publication that the ML should have thanked the\nFoundation and that the acknowledgement to the Carnegie Corporation\nwould have to be removed. Klopfer agreed to rip the title leaf out of\nevery copy in stock and tip in a corrected leaf with the acknowledgment,\n“The publishers are indebted to the National Home Library Foundation for\nmaking this edition possible and wish to thank them for the courtesy\nextended in the use of their plates” (Klopfer to Mittell, 27 February\n1941; Mittell to Klopfer, 4 March 1941). A sizable portion of the first\nprinting appears to have been distributed before the cancellation and\nreplacement of the title leaf. Copies of 338a<sub>2</sub> are notably\nharder to find than copies of 338a<sub>1</sub>.\n\nAfter Mittell’s death in 1942 his widow offered to sell the National\nHome Library Foundation plates to the ML. Cerf offered $250, then raised\nhis offer to $350 (Cerf to Fanny Mittell, 10 August 1942). The offer\nappears to have been accepted. In 1960 Jason Epstein reported that the\nML paid no royalty and owned the plates free and clear but still showed\npractically no profit per copy (Epstein to Willard A. Lockwood, 24 May\n1960).\n\n#",

The next four years would be difficult, as publishers\nstruggled with a huge increase in demand for books coupled with scarcity\nof resources, including paper rationing, the absence of personnel who\nserved in the armed services, and other dislocations caused by the war.\nThe end of the war in August 1945 was accompanied by rapid inflation and\na wave of strikes that disrupted the return to a peacetime economy. It\nwould be September 1948 before the Modern Library could announce, “Every\ntitle in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now back in\nstock for the first time since the war” (Modern Library advertisement,\n*Publishers’ Weekly*, September 17, 1948, p. 1095).\n\n### Number of titles\n\nTen titles were added to the ML and ten were discontinued. The number of\ntitles in the series remained at 219, the same as in 1940.\n\n### Title page\n\nModern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by\nJoseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He\ncreated the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and\nmaking electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer.\n\n### Binding\n\nThe binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used\nsmooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or\ngray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the\nspine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black\nor dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of\ngreen bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were\nusually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a\nsingle color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover\nwere framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was\nstamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front\ncover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within\nwhich Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold.\n\n### Endpaper\n\nThe enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the\nML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through\nspring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers\nfeatured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by a pattern of open books and\n“ml” initials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through\nspring 1966.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTwo 1941 titles (Saroyan, *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* and\nBemelmans, *My War with the United States*) were originally published by\nRandom House; their ML jackets were adapted from the RH jackets. The\nSaroyan jacket was designed by Ernest Reichl, and the jacket for *My War\nwith the United States* featured an adaptation of one of Bemelmans’s\nillustrations.\n\nThe jacket for Steinbeck, *The Grapes of Wrath* incorporated a\nreproduction of Thomas Hart Benton’s lithograph “Departure of the Joads”\nfrom his Grapes of Wrath series. Paul Galdone was responsible for three\njackets: Hugo, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was an individually\ndesigned pictorial jacket; *Five Great Modern Irish Plays* and Lardner,\n*Collected Stories* featured a decorative non-pictorial design that was\nused on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s.\n\nPascal, *Pensées & The Provincial Letters*, had a typographic jacket\nthat was clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal. Three other\npredominately typographic jackets were probably also by Blumenthal, who\nsigned none of his jackets. *The Federalist* featured a decorative image\nof an American eagle, Proust’s *The Captive* had a small silhouette of\nProust in left profile that was also used on the other six titles of\n*Remembrance of Things Past*, and Plato’s *Republic* had an inset\nphotographic image of a bust of Plato.\n\n### Price\n\n95 cents.\n\n### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Hugo, *Hunchback of Notre Dame* xBemelmans, *My War with the\nUnited States*; Giants through G56; jackets: 271 (=spring 1940). (Fall)\nBemelmans, *My War with the United States* xLewis, *Babbitt*; Giants\nthrough G58 with G20–21 Symonds, *Renaissance in Italy*; jackets: 278.\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nCerf expressed interest in Ernest Hemingway’s *For Whom the Bell Tolls*,\npublished by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1940: “This is one book above\nalmost any other that has been written in the past five years that I’d\nlike to see on the Modern Library list when the time comes” (Cerf to Max\nPerkins, 23 July 1941). The ML never secured reprint rights. In 1953\nScribner’s served notice that it was withdrawing all three Hemingway\ntitles in the ML—*The Sun Also Rises* (190), *A Farewell to Arms* (237),\nand *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* (G59)—in order to publish\ntheir own reprint editions in all English-speaking markets in North\nAmerica.\n\nConrad Aiken repeated his suggestion for a ML edition of his first\nnovel, *Blue Voyage*, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1927\n(Aiken to Cerf, 19 May 1941). Aiken edited several poetry anthologies\nfor the ML, but he never had a book of his own in the series.\n\n### New titles\n\nSaroyan, *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* (1941–1948) 336\n\nHugo, *Hunchback of Notre Dame* (1941–1971) 337\n\n*The Federalist* (1941– ) 338\n\n*Five Great Modern Irish Plays* (1941– ) 339\n\nProust, *The Captive* (1941– ) 340\n\nSteinbeck, *Grapes of Wrath* (1941– ) 341\n\nPlato, *The Republic* (1941– ) 342\n\nBemelmans, *My War with the United States* (1941– ) 343\n\nLardner, *Collected Stories of Ring Lardner* (1941– ) 344\n\nPascal, *Pensées; The Provincial Letters* (1941– ) 345### Discontinued\n\nBeebe, *Jungle Peace* (1925)\n\nFerber, *Show Boat* (1935)\n\nHeyward, *Porgy* (1934)\n\nMerejkowski, *Death of the Gods* (1929)\n\nMerejkowski, *Peter and Alexis* (1931)\n\nNewton, *Amenities of Book Collecting* (1935)\n\nNorris, *The Pit* (1934)\n\nStein, *Three Lives* (1933)\n\nWallace, *Ben Hur* (1933)\n\nWaugh, *Vile Bodies* (1933)\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 336\n\n**WILLIAM SAROYAN.

Adapted\nfrom Ernst Reichl’s jacket for the original RH edition. The original\njacket is signed “REICHL” in sans-serif capitals along the lower right\nmargin.

ML edition (pp. \\[vii–x\\],\n9–270) printed from RH plates with running heads removed to accommodate\nthe ML’s smaller format and with page numerals 7–8 removed from the\ntable of contents, which was revised to include Saroyan’s preface to the\nML edition. Published January 1941. *WR* 25 January 1941. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1948.\n\n*The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* was one of the first trade\ntitles published by Random House. Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to\ndesign trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the\nplates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such\nas the removal of running heads.\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May\n1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML\ntitles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the\nML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was\nout of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print\nand that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to\nSaroyan, 5 April 1949).\n\n### 337\n\n**VICTOR HUGO.

Burt Co. and\nother publishers. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–416) printed from Burt plates\nwith the table of contents reset. Published January 1941. *WR* 25\nJanuary 1941. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on\nthe first printing of Hugo’s *Notre-Dame de Paris* (1831) and does not\ninclude three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in\nDecember 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and\nBook Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation\nused by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and\nBook Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and\n5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not\n“augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The\nthree added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been\nmisplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be\nincluded in the 1832 printing (Hugo, *Notre-Dame de Paris*, translated\nand edited by John Sturrock \\[London: Penguin Books, 2004\\], pp. 26–29).\n\nThe absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill\nThat), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the\nprinting press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the\npublic expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during\nthe world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan\npagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of\nthe human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious\nsymbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own\nmonument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191).\n\nWhen the ML reprinted *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* in 1996 as part of\nthe “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous\nand incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and\n1971.\n\n*The Hunchback of Notre Dame* sold 4,004 copies during the 18-month\nperiod 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter\nof ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952. Hugo’s *Les Misérables* (G3) was in first quarter of\nML titles at both periods.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nHugo, *Les Misérables* (Giant, 1931–1973, 1980– ) G3\n\n### 338\n\n**THE FEDERALIST. 1941–1970.

The ML paid Viking Press a\n$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for non-exclusive\nreprint rights. There was a ML printing of 2,000 copies in December\n1942; later printings included 4,000 copies each in May 1943 and June\n1944.\n\nThe ML edition sold 9,495 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing *The Grapes of Wrath* in the middle of the first quarter of ML\nand Giant titles. Sales declined to 3,964 copies during the 12-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it toward the bottom of the\nfirst quarter of titles.\n\nIn Chapter 30 (the last chapter) of Viking Press printings, the number\nof lines per page increases between the fifth printing (May 1939) and\nninth printing (September 1939). The first page of Chapter 30 (p. 593)\nof the ninth printing has one more line than early printings; lines are\nshifted forward throughout the chapter, with the result that the last\npage of text (p. 619) has only four lines—five fewer than the fifth\nprinting. The reason for the shift has not been determined. The plates\nused by the ML reflect the later configuration of Chapter 30.\n\nThe ML’s reprint contract appears to have been terminated in 1958 when\nViking Press published *The Grapes of Wrath* in its quality paperback\nseries, Compass Books.

The\n> most important of the Socratic dialogues, the *Republic* is concerned\n> with the construction of an ideal commonwealth and thus wins its place\n> as the earliest of utopias. At the same time, it seeks to define the\n> word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes\n> various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But\n> above all, the *Republic* is an attempt to define “justice”; by\n> imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to\n> see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows\n> himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.\n>\n> The text used here is the classic Jowett translation, complete and\n> unabridged, with notes and marginalia for the student, scholar, and\n> general reader alike.\n\nPublished fall 1982 at $7.95.

Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition\nwith a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN\nLIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot\nof the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML\njacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the\nBemelmans drawing on the title page.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own\n> foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ *My War with the United States* fulfils\n> that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It\n> persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American\n> Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and\n> wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its\n> illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and\n> civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a\n> reprint edition.\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. \\[3\\],\n\\[5\\]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published\nOctober 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1948.\n\nThe verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,\n“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway\nPrinting Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The\nML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that\nspecialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its\nstandard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible\nthat Parkway subcontracted the job.\n\nThere are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a\nML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were\nprinted from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset\nprinting.\n\nThe jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and\nthe inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings\nof the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring\n1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so\nthey could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.\n\nThe ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl\nHarbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings\nare on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to\nenhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset\nlithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of\nwartime paper shortages.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and\nGiant titles.\n\n### 344\n\n**RING LARDNER.

Cerf had tried to get Lardner’s stories for the ML on several\noccasions before Scribner’s agreed to a reprint edition. He noted in\nspring 1941 when he requested permission to include the book in the\nfall, “It is a glaring omission on our list and it has been commented on\nso many times that I am getting tired of hearing it” (Cerf to Max\nPerkins, 1 May 1941). There was a second printing of 4,000 copies in\nMarch 1942 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in January 1943.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,800 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it in the first quarter of regular ML and Giant\ntitles.

  "year": "1941",
  "general": "The last title added in 1941, Pascal’s *Pensées & The Provincial\nLetters* (345), was published a month before the Japanese attack on\nPearl Harbor. The next four years would be difficult, as publishers\nstruggled with a huge increase in demand for books coupled with scarcity\nof resources, including paper rationing, the absence of personnel who\nserved in the armed services, and other dislocations caused by the war.\nThe end of the war in August 1945 was accompanied by rapid inflation and\na wave of strikes that disrupted the return to a peacetime economy. It\nwould be September 1948 before the Modern Library could announce, “Every\ntitle in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now back in\nstock for the first time since the war” (Modern Library advertisement,\n*Publishers’ Weekly*, September 17, 1948, p. 1095).",
  "numberOfTitles": "Ten titles were added to the ML and ten were discontinued. The number of\ntitles in the series remained at 219, the same as in 1940.",
  "titlePage": "Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by\nJoseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He\ncreated the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and\nmaking electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer.",
  "binding": "The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format\nwas introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used\nsmooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or\ngray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the\nspine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black\nor dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of\ngreen bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were\nusually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a\nsingle color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover\nwere framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was\nstamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front\ncover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within\nwhich Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold.",
  "endpaper": "The enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the\nML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through\nspring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers\nfeatured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by a pattern of open books and\n“ml” initials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through\nspring 1966.\n\n**Jackets**\n\nTwo 1941 titles (Saroyan, *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* and\nBemelmans, *My War with the United States*) were originally published by\nRandom House; their ML jackets were adapted from the RH jackets. The\nSaroyan jacket was designed by Ernest Reichl, and the jacket for *My War\nwith the United States* featured an adaptation of one of Bemelmans’s\nillustrations.\n\nThe jacket for Steinbeck, *The Grapes of Wrath* incorporated a\nreproduction of Thomas Hart Benton’s lithograph “Departure of the Joads”\nfrom his Grapes of Wrath series. Paul Galdone was responsible for three\njackets: Hugo, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was an individually\ndesigned pictorial jacket; *Five Great Modern Irish Plays* and Lardner,\n*Collected Stories* featured a decorative non-pictorial design that was\nused on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s.\n\nPascal, *Pensées & The Provincial Letters*, had a typographic jacket\nthat was clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal. Three other\npredominately typographic jackets were probably also by Blumenthal, who\nsigned none of his jackets. *The Federalist* featured a decorative image\nof an American eagle, Proust’s *The Captive* had a small silhouette of\nProust in left profile that was also used on the other six titles of\n*Remembrance of Things Past*, and Plato’s *Republic* had an inset\nphotographic image of a bust of Plato.",

The ML never secured reprint rights.

Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the\nML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was\nout of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print\nand that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to\nSaroyan, 5 April 1949)."

The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and\nBook Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation\nused by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and\nBook Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and\n5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not\n“augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The\nthree added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been\nmisplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be\nincluded in the 1832 printing (Hugo, *Notre-Dame de Paris*, translated\nand edited by John Sturrock \\[London: Penguin Books, 2004\\], pp. 26–29).\n\nThe absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill\nThat), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the\nprinting press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the\npublic expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during\nthe world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan\npagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of\nthe human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious\nsymbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own\nmonument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191).\n\nWhen the ML reprinted *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* in 1996 as part of\nthe “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous\nand incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and\n1971.\n\n*The Hunchback of Notre Dame* sold 4,004 copies during the 18-month\nperiod 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter\nof ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952. Hugo’s *Les Misérables* (G3) was in first quarter of\nML titles at both periods.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nHugo, *Les Misérables* (Giant, 1931–1973, 1980– ) G3"

The ML paid Viking Press a\n$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for non-exclusive\nreprint rights.

Now, just as it had four centuries before the Christian\n> era, Plato’s description of the ideal commonwealth has a special\n> timeliness; it outlines a pattern of government that free men can\n> follow with trust and conviction. This edition includes, in addition\n> to the complete and unabridged text, the Jowett references and\n> marginal notes. (*Fall 1957*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.

At the same time, it seeks to define the\n> word “philosopher,” questions our perception of reality, and describes\n> various constitutions, citing their relative merits and defects. But\n> above all, the *Republic* is an attempt to define “justice”; by\n> imagining the best possible State, Plato reasons, it will be easier to\n> see what makes the just individual, and in his argument he shows\n> himself at the peak of his dialectical and literary powers.\n>\n> The text used here is the classic Jowett translation, complete and\n> unabridged, with notes and marginalia for the student, scholar, and\n> general reader alike.\n\nPublished fall 1982 at $7.95.

The first printing is on thicker paper than\nmost of the later printings, and there is no list of titles inside the\njacket.\n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), moderate yellow\n(87) and black on cream paper with drawing of a fort and cannon in black\nand moderate greenish blue against moderate yellow background; lettering\nin black except last two words of title in moderate greenish blue\noutlined in black. Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition\nwith a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN\nLIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot\nof the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML\njacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the\nBemelmans drawing on the title page.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own\n> foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ *My War with the United States* fulfils\n> that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters. It\n> persuades you by its honesty and its charm that life in the American\n> Army can be anything from a consecration to a lark. Both amiable and\n> wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its\n> illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and\n> civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a\n> reprint edition.\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. \\[3\\],\n\\[5\\]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published\nOctober 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1948.\n\nThe verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,\n“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway\nPrinting Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The\nML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that\nspecialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its\nstandard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible\nthat Parkway subcontracted the job.\n\nThere are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a\nML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were\nprinted from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset\nprinting.\n\nThe jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and\nthe inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings\nof the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring\n1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so\nthey could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.\n\nThe ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl\nHarbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings\nare on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to\nenhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset\nlithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of\nwartime paper shortages.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and\nGiant titles."

Cerf had tried to get Lardner’s stories for the ML on several\noccasions before Scribner’s agreed to a reprint edition. He noted in\nspring 1941 when he requested permission to include the book in the\nfall, “It is a glaring omission on our list and it has been commented on\nso many times that I am getting tired of hearing it” (Cerf to Max\nPerkins, 1 May 1941). There was a second printing of 4,000 copies in\nMarch 1942 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in January 1943.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,800 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it in the first quarter of regular ML and Giant\ntitles.
