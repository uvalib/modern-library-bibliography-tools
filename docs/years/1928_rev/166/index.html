The most popular of his books, it stands alone as a unique recreation of what was actually Proust’s own childhood. Swann, the focal character, is the son of a stockbroker and has entered into an “unfortunate” marriage. Marcel, the narrator, remembers that his family’s guests during the early period of his life were practically limited to Swann, who, like the other people in Marcel’s early memories, seemed to him to be “abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree.”"
