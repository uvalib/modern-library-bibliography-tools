    "“In ‘The Sea and the Jungle’ we have surely one of the great achievements of maritime narrative. There need be no fatuous comparisons. Sometimes they are useful as a label for the instruction of those who must have things expressed in terms of what they know already. But in speaking of this book, that has earned its right to stand among the most thoughtful of our time, we can be absolute. The author’s own casual phrase will serve, ‘This is a travel book for honest men.’ Beneath the sheer beauty of the writing you will find that plain virtue, that honesty, that fidelity to the ungainly fact.”  —Christopher Morley(Spring 1928)",

    "From the moment H. M. Tomlinson, caught and caged by the city, watched the Putney bus take on a casual passenger, and then the Skipper himself, until theCapellamade port from Pará and the Madeira jungle, this book spreads a tapestry of pictures and places, adventures and yarns, and talk of great things and little in the sure accents of truth.The Sea and the Jungleis more than a travel book or a maritime narrative; it is writing of sheer beauty, unswerving fidelity and scrupulous honesty. (Fall 1933)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by E. P. Dutton Co., 1913, using sheets of the English edition published by Duckworth. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1928.WR17 March 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.",
    "The Sea and the Jungleappears to have been in the U.S. public domain because of its original publication in the U.S using imported sheets. The ML paid royalties directly to Tomlinson.",
    "Sales ofThe Sea and the Jungleduring the first six months of 1928 placed it 15th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales.",
