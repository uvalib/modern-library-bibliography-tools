(Fall 1928) Front flap: The mighty corridors of heaven and the mean and fashionable streets of Paris provide the scenes for Anatole France’s most fabulous satire. Angels and mortals, seraphim and syndicalists, demiurges and trollops mingle in love and in the daily pursuits of life. This novel, recounting the visitation to earth of the messengers of God and Satan, reveals Anatole France at his impious best as the subtle ironist and the resourceful historian of disillusion.The Revolt of the Angelsis one of five Anatole France titles in the Modern Library. (Spring 1934) Translation by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson originally published in U.S. by John Lane, 1914, and from 1922 by Dodd, Mead & Co. ML edition (pp. [1–4], 7–348) printed from a duplicate set of Lane/Dodd, Mead plates with running heads removed and original page numerals in the headline replaced by smaller numerals placed closer to the text. Published September 1928.WR13 October 1928. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939. The Dodd, Mead trade edition ofThe Revolt of the Angelswas an attractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page (text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins. The Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid typesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a type page that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard trim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem.  [scan of Dodd, Mead ed. w ML Jacket Scans file] In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by photographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the type page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The quality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were higher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an option in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were developed in the early part of the century, but it was not until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book printing industry. The method would have had more use in its early days had it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not well enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked lithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee,Bookmaking, 2nd ed., p. 136). The Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals were part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page numerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the first line of text, and they were set in a different font that was smaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals. Margins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was ⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted to the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The result was the one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. The Revolt of the Angelssold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter. The ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of 17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings of 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly before the final printing. Subsequent sales were as follows: 366 copies (July–December 1936); 344 copies (1937); 319 copies (1938); and 256 copies (January–June 1939, after the ML edition was officially discontinued). The figures for July 1936–June 1939 include the resale of copies returned by booksellers; sales subject to royalty payments during this period totaled 753 copies. The Revolt of the Angelswas discontinued in 1938 because of declining sales, shortly before the ML introduced a new and larger format designed by Joseph Blumenthal that could have accommodated the Dodd, Mead plates more comfortably.
