    "The Modern Library offers you herewith a complete and unabridged “Three Musketeers” in one volume to slip into your coat pocket or tuck into an accessible corner of your library shelf. For the next time a fit of boredom or weariness assails you, a dose of d’Artagnan and his three musketeers—Porthos, Athos, and Aramis—is confidently prescribed. (Spring 1928)",

    "However much the industry of Alexandre Dumas is held up as an example of literature in its first manifestations of mass production,The Three Musketeersstill throbs with undiminished pulse for the modern reader. Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos [sic] and Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan, there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first and final perfection. (Spring 1934)",
    "Anonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. ML edition printed from Burt plates. Publication announced for February 1928.WR26 May 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1950 by Le Clercq translation (153.2).",

    "This brand-new translation of one of the world’s masterpieces of adventure is alive with the excitement that has held generation after generation of readers spellbound. For those three inseparables, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, with their fourth comrade-in-arms, d’Artagnan, there never can be a dull moment. They are the archetypes of the “cape and sword” heroes whose persistence in fiction is the best possible tribute to Alexandre Dumas, the man who created them in their first and final perfection. (Spring 1950)Note:Copies of the first printing are most often seen in spring 1950 jackets, but it was not unusual for jackets of new ML titles published in January to have lists from the previous season. Copies of this jacket have been reported with the fall 1949 ML list (MLC 47, April 2004, p. 6).",
