Text on front: The Modern Library offers you herewith a complete and unabridged “Three Musketeers” in one volume to slip into your coat pocket or tuck into an accessible corner of your library shelf. For the next time a fit of boredom or weariness assails you, a dose of d’Artagnan and his three musketeers—Porthos, Athos, and Aramis—is confidently prescribed. (Spring 1928) Jacket B:Uniform typographic jacket D. (Fall 1929) Jacket C:Pictorial in vivid red (11) and black on cream paper depicting four swords held aloft with a plumed hat perched on one of the swords; lettering in black, borders in vivid red. Signed: Staloff. (Spring 1931) Front flap: However much the industry of Alexandre Dumas is held up as an example of literature in its first manifestations of mass production,The Three Musketeersstill throbs with undiminished pulse for the modern reader. Around those three inseparables, Athos, Parthos [sic] and Aramis, and their fourth comrade in arms and adventure, d’Artagnan, there is a glamorous aura and romantic flourish. They are the progenitors of those “cape and sword” characters whose persistence in fiction is the best tribute to the man who created them in their first and final perfection. (Spring 1934) Anonymous translation previously published in U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. ML edition printed from Burt plates. Publication announced for February 1928.WR26 May 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1950 by Le Clercq translation (153.2). The ML bought a set of plates from Burt. Neither Burt nor the ML knew the name of the translator or the date of the translation (Doris Schneider to E. P. Dutton Co., 4 April 1929). Sales ofThe Three Musketeersduring the first six months of 1928 placed it 18th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 it was low in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. 153.1b.

For those three inseparables, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, with their fourth comrade-in-arms, d’Artagnan, there never can be a dull moment. They are the archetypes of the “cape and sword” heroes whose persistence in fiction is the best possible tribute to Alexandre Dumas, the man who created them in their first and final perfection.
