When, in 1912, Gerhart Hauptmann, then fifty years of age, was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, it was “principally for his rich, versatile and prominent activity in the realm of the drama.” To a world which knows Hauptmann by his “The Sunken Bell,” there is no more convenient way of introducing a work of his which yet is not so widely known as by saying that “The Heretic of Soana” is to Gerhart Hauptmann’s prose fiction what “The Sunken Bell” is to his poetical dramas. (Spring 1928; Fall 1928)"
