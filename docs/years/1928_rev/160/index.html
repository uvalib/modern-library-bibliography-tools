    "The world knows Gerhart Hauptmann as dramatist, and, largely because of the nature of some of his dramas, as poet. When, in 1912, Gerhart Hauptmann, then fifty years of age, was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, it was “principally for his rich, versatile and prominent activity in the realm of the drama.” To a world which knows Hauptmann by his “The Sunken Bell,” there is no more convenient way of introducing a work of his which yet is not so widely known as by saying that “The Heretic of Soana” is to Gerhart Hauptmann’s prose fiction what “The Sunken Bell” is to his poetical dramas. (Spring 1928; Fall 1928)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1923, whose firm merged with Viking Press in 1925. ML edition (pp. [3]–192) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates with the Huebsch half title used as a fly title. Published July 1928.WR4 August 1928. First (and probably only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued April 1931.",
    "The ML failed to identify the translator, Bayard Quincy Morgan. Viking Press pointed out the oversight, and Klopfer promised to add Morgan’s name to the next printing (Klopfer to Viking Press, 23 July 1930). However,The Heretic ofSoanasold poorly, and there does not appear to have been a second printing. Copies of the first printing have been seen with the remainder marking of a star stamped on the endpaper."
