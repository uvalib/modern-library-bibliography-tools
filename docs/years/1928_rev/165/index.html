Front flap: The first of modern philosophers to insist on the primacy of will over intellect, Schopenhauer, who himself derived much of his thought from Kant, started a movement whose influence was felt by Nietzsche, James, Bergson and Dewey. The continuing popularity of his work, however, rests not on his influence on other thinkers of his time or on the logical strength of his metaphysics, but on his resonant prose, and the accessibility to the nonacademic reader of what Irwin Edman calls, in his introduction, a “philosophy in the old and appealing meaning of the wisdom of life. . . . the alert, half-sad, half-cynical harvest of a candid eye.” This volume contains Schopenhauer’s major work,The World as Will and Idea, as well as the essay, “The Metaphysics of the Love of the Sexes.” Also in the Modern Library Schopenhauer,Studies in Pessimism(1917–1934)  12"
