    "The four books of Rabelais remain forever the four gospels of the joyous and irredeemable brotherhood of sinners. Against the weariness of a forbidding morality and the rumbling pretences of its pious advocates, there is always the wholehearted ribaldry and rollicking laughter of Rabelais. His gigantic nonsense and his gay and lecherous love of life give his books the stature and vitality of his own heroes. The Modern Library version, condensed by Professor Donald Douglas, is as faithful in spirit as it is intelligent in its selectiveness. (Fall 1933)",

    "The ML commissioned Douglas to prepare an abridged edition of Rabelais. The manuscript was due in May 1927, but Douglas’s work on it was held up by a succession of bouts with influenza. There were other problems as well. In one letter he told Cerf, “I had worked about six hours a day for a week on Rabelais . . . and then you told me the whole thing must be expurgated” (Douglas to Cerf, 6 October 1927). When he finally submitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever did in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).",
    "Douglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse Rabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells would say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the immense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth or turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of stones. By the laws of our own age it has become necessary and obligatory” (pp. ix–x). Douglas’s edition was superseded in 1944 byTheComplete Worksof Rabelais(G66) in an unabridged translation by Jacques Le Clercq.",
