    "John Addington Symond’s [sic] biography is more than a study of a unique personality; it is an incarnation of the Renaissance and an evaluation of its most titanic symbol. In the ninety years of Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a century was consecrated to a burning sense of beauty, which took form in his colossal plastic figures and the impassioned sonnets. The versatile creator of the Sistine chapel, sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and writer completely embodies the Carlyle-Nietzschean conception of “the hero as artist.” (Fall 1933)",

    "Even more than a study of one of the most heroic personalities of history, John Addington Symond’s [sic] biography of Michelangelo becomes an evaluation of the Renaissance and its most titanic symbol. Of the ninety years of Michelangelo’s life, three-quarters of a century was consecrated to his great works of art. The unexcelled sculptured figures and the impassioned sonnets suggest two facets of his complex creative personality. The painter of the Sistine Chapel, the sculptor of the Medicean tombs, the architect and the writer indicate the versatility of his gifts and the richness of the heritage he has bestowed upon mankind.
