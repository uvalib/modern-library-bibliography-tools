Both jackets were printed on pale yellow paper;       series THE MODERN LIBRARY appeared in the lower. The paragraph of descriptive text that had been used on the front panel of ML jackets since 1917 was dropped completely. In its place was the title in large capitals that could be read easily from a distance of five or six feet, a torchbearer that was nearly twice the size of the torchbearer on uniform typographic jacket B2, and brief descriptive text in smaller type. The jacket for The Revolt of the Angels stated, “One of the five of Anatole France’s greatest books available in this edition”; that of Gargantua and Pantagruel stated, “Intelligently condensed into one volume by prof. donald douglas of Columbia University.” The colored rules did not make the books stand out on bookstore shelves, and uniform jacket C was replaced the following month by uniform typographic jacket D."

The new jackets differed from uniform typographic jacket C in two respects. The colored rules near the top and foot were extended to the upper and lower edges of the jacket, creating colored borders 7/16 inch wide which extended over the front and back panels, backstrip, and jacket flaps. And the jackets were printed in different color combinations. The borders were printed in deep reddish orange, moderate blue, or moderate yellowish green; the paper stock was light greenish blue, brilliant yellow, or pale yellow. Most booksellers displayed Modern Library books together. The vivid and varied colors of the jacket borders and paper stock significantly increased the visual appeal of groups of ML books displayed in book and department stores."

The quality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were higher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an option in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were developed in the early part of the century, but it was not until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book printing industry. The method would have had more use in its early days had it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not well enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked lithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee,"

Margins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was ⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted to the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot.
