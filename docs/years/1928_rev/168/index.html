    "Virginia Woolf’s vibrant sensitiveness to the casual, her unerring susceptibility to impressions and the firm texture of her prose combine to makeMrs. Dallowaya novel of distinction and absorbing interest. The events of the single day on which Clarissa Dalloway prepares for a party become a pageant of London. By means of technique both delicate and sure, a vivid chronicle of men and women of diverse character unfolds itself, revealing a cross-section of English life compressed into the flow of a few hours. (Fall 1936)",
    "JacketB:Non-pictorial jacket in light violet (210), deep reddish orange (36) and black on white paper with title in deep reddish orange on inset white panel on diagonal axis; author’s name in reverse and other lettering in black, all against light violet background. Designed by Valenti Angelo; unsigned. Front flap as jacket A. (Spring 1939)",
    "Originally published in U.S. by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1925. ML edition (pp. 3–296) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published December 1928.WR12 January 1929. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued fall 1949.",
    "ML sales ofMrs. Dallowaytotaled 61,000 copies (Kirkpatrick,Virginia Woolf, p. 26).Mrs. Dallowaysold 4,271 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales.To the Lighthouse(306) was in the fourth quarter during this period with sales of 3,203 copies.",
    "Lewis Miller, the RH sales manager, reviewed the jacket design that Angelo originally submitted and asked for revisions: “Would you try to do the lettering for the title in a little simpler fashion to increase visibility. Also the pinkish lettering against the white is perhaps not strong enough. Could I recommend that you think in terms of a darker ink for the lettering?” (Miller to Angelo, 15 March 1939).",
    "Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning postwar college market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts forMrs. Dalloway,To the Lighthouse, and seven other titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis, Katherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 1,400 copies ofMrs. Dallowayin stock. Klopfer estimated that it would take six months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948).",
