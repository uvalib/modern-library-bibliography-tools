    "The writer of some of the most beautiful lyric poems in English and a romantic, almost legendary figure in his own right, Lord Byron is known to many of us as both a creator and archetype of the melancholy, world-weary wanderer in literature to whom he unwittingly bequeathed his own name, the “Byronic hero.” Such is the figure revealed in the cantos ofChilde Harold’s Pilgrimage, while the selections in this volume fromHebrew MelodiesandHours of Idlenessprove the poet’s great lyric gifts. But such additional works asBeppoandThe Vision of Judgment,English Bardsand Scotch Reviewersand the occasional verses penned for his friends show us a poet equally at home in ironic high comedy and biting satire, a poet capable of facing the world and human nature with unwavering realism. (Spring 1954)",

    "Marchand received a flat fee of $250 for writing the introduction and selecting the contents; $50 for preparing editorial head notes, which are printed within square brackets at the beginning of each section; and an additional $100 when the collection was published in the regular ML. Stein told him, “SinceDon Juanis already available in the Modern Library, this means that we can include roughly half of Byron’s remaining poetical writings and a small selection of his prose if you feel any of it should be included” (Stein to Marchand, 27 June 1950).",
