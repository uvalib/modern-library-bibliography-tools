(Late 1950s/early 1960s) Jacket:Pictorial in strong greenish yellow (99), dark grayish blue (187) and black on coated white paper with oval illustration of the columned porch of a house, gnarled trees hanging with Spanish moss, and a low moon, surrounded by a strong greenish yellow glow and scattered stars; lettering in dark grayish blue and black. Signed: PG [Paul Galdone]. Front flap: Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved.(Fall 1954) A Curtain of Greenoriginally published with Porter introduction by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published asA Curtain of Green and Other Storiesby Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947.The Wide Net and Other Storiesoriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954.WR16 October 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Cerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt, Brace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager sentA Curtain of Green,The Robber Bridegroom,The Wide Net,Delta Wedding, andThe Golden Apples, expressing the hope that the ML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The reprint contract forSelected Stories of Eudora Weltywas signed a month later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk reports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete information about printings and sales is not available in the RH archives, but the following evidence is suggestive:Selected Stories of Eudora Weltydoes not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than 2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and it sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500 titles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the titles that survived. Textual variants between the first edition ofA Curtain of Green(Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text of the Modern LibraryA Curtain of Green” (1979). Polk writes: In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition ofA Curtain of Green. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text ofA Curtain of Greenis two typesettings removed from the first American edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted the Harcourt, Brace text in itsSelected Stories(NY, 1954), it of course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text ofA Curtain of Greenis both the only one currently in print and the text most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6) In his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the Harcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in print and the one most frequently cited. 471b.

Polk indicates that the ML edition went out of print in October 1977 after 27,035 copies had been printed and that it was brought back into print in 1978 (Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work, p. 94). It appears more likely that it went out of print in 1976 since 471c was published in fall 1977."
