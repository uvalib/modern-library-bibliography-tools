    "Samuel Hoffenstein practices in the tradition of sparkling light verse that has become one of the most refreshing trends on the American literary scene. And even in that tradition he is unique, as evidenced by the constantly increasing corps of Hoffenstein devotees. In this book, to their infinite joy and that of the hosts of newcomers who will join their ranks upon its publication, the Modern Library presents the complete Hoffenstein to date, the full texts of his three volumes—Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing, Year In, You’re Out,andPencil in the Air. (Spring 1954)",
    "Poems in Praise of Practically Nothingoriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1928;Year In, You’re Outoriginally published by Horace Liveright, 1930;Pencil in the Airoriginally published by Doubleday & Co., 1947. Original ML collection printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1954.WR29 May 1954. First (and only) printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.",
    "The ML paid a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Rights toPencil in the Airhad reverted to Hoffenstein’s estate, and the advance was divided equally between Liveright and David Hoffenstein, the author’s son. The ML edition sold about 6,000 copies in four and a half years (David Hoffenstein to Cerf, 9 December 1958). When the ML edition was discontinued Cerf wrote to David Hoffenstein, “I am sorry to say that we cannot possibly keep the Hoffenstein Poetry in the Modern Library. Quite frankly, it was one of the very poorest sellers we have ever had in the series. I am just as sorry about this as I know you are” (Cerf to David Hoffenstein, 23 December 1958)."
