(Spring 1963)Note:The contents heading is dropped on the page, leaving no room for a page numeral at the foot. Jacket:Uniform Aristotle jacket in moderate greenish blue (173) and black on coated white paper with top half consisting of white band with jacket title “The Rhetoric and The Poetics of Aristotle” and left-profile portrait of Aristotle in black and moderate greenish blue; moderate greenish blue band below center with lettering in black; thinner band at foot with series in moderate greenish blue. Front flap: For more than two thousand years, theRhetoricand thePoeticsof Aristotle have enjoyed the zealous acclaim of some readers and endured the hostile scrutiny of others. But, in any case, few words of antiquity have had more constant influence in Western thought than have these writings. It has long been the hope of the editors of the Modern Library to include these works in complete form, and now permission to use the distinguished Oxford translations by Roberts and Bywater makes this book possible. To it, Professor Solmsen has contributed a distinguished introduction and a body of helpful notes. (Fall 1954) ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1954.WR29 January 1955. First printing: Not ascertained. The Bywater translation ofPoeticswas originally published by the Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1909; the Roberts translation ofRhetoricwas originally published by the Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1924. The ML paid Clarendon Press a $300 advance on the first 10,000 copies and royalties of 5 percent of the list price thereafter. Solmsen received a flat fee of $300 for his work on the ML edition. Stein found Solmsen’s English a bit clumsy and sent the introduction to Sidney Kaplan at the University of Massachusetts for stylistic improvement and clarification. Kaplan received $30 for this work. “The selection from the notes to the Roberts and Bywater edition has been made by Professor Solmsen, who has also made the emendations enclosed by brackets” (p.

Front flap: Few works of antiquity have had a more constant influence in Western thought than Aristotle’sRhetoricandPoetics. For the distinguished Oxford translations by W.

Front flap: Here is the complete text of two of Aristotle’s most important and influential works, in the famous and authoritative Oxford translations by W. Rhys Roberts and Ingram Bywater. Aristotle’s intention when he composed thePoeticswas to set up standards of literary excellence, and in theRhetoriche sought to establish standards of effective public speaking. For more than two thousand years theRhetoricand thePoeticshave met with both hostile scrutiny and zealous acclaim; few works of antiquity have had more constant influence in Western thought.
