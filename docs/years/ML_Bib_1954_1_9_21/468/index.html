Front flap: No poet in English literature excelled Robert Browning in the ability to understand the human heart and mind and soul. The tangled web of love and hate, hope and despair, faith and disbelief envelops the panorama of memorable characters in his poetry—lords, ladies, monks, alchemists, scholars, musicians, and others who crowd the colorful pages of his work. Throughout his writing there is an unbroken fortitude and an awareness of man’s capacity for greatness that provides inspiring guidance to all in a troubled time. (Fall 1954) Original ML collection. Published in MLCE January 1951 and the regular ML 13 October 1954.WR16 October 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.
