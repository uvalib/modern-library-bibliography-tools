Signed: Staloff. (Fall 1931) Front flap: Of the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none is in greater favor than Homer’sThe Odysseyand its companion volume,The Iliad(No. 166). The immortal epic of the ten-year wanderings of Ulysses remains as vivid to the contemporary reader as it was when first recited to Homer’s enthralled audience many centuries before the Christian era. The Modern Library edition of the Butcher and Lang prose translation has been adopted by many leading universities as the standard text of this classic. (Fall 1936) Butcher and Lang translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1879. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1929.WRnot found. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1962 by Rees translation (187.2). See 186.1a for information about the selection of the Butcher and Lang translation. TheOdysseyranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943, slightly belowThe Iliad. It was near the top of the second quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, four titles belowThe Iliad. 187.1b.

(Spring 1962) Jacket:Pictorial in strong greenish blue (169), moderate greenish yellow (102) and black on coated white paper with a small ship in moderate greenish yellow against sea represented by wavy black lines; lettering in reverse and black, all against strong greenish blue background. Front flap: This is a completely new translation of the ODYSSEY of Homer. Brilliantly done in natural, free-flowing verse, it is the most readable version available to modern readers. The successful recapture here of the flavor and meaning of the ODYSSEY will enable the reader to see fully why the epic story of the wanderings of Odysseus has been one of the most treasured legacies of ancient Greece. (Spring 1962) Rees translation originally published by Random House, 1960. ML edition (pp. vii–416) printed from RH plates, with the title page adapted from the original plates. Published spring 1962.WR4 June 1962. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Rees’s translation ofThe Odysseyfilled the need for a modern verse translation. Richmond Lattimore’s verse translation ofThe Odysseydid not appear until 1967, sixteen years after his translation ofThe Iliad. The Lattimore translation probably would not have been available to the ML in any case.\tRees’s verse translation ofThe Iliadwas published in 1963 and was added to the ML the following year (see 186.2). Both of Rees’s volumes were designed so that the plates could be used for ML printings. The ML title page reproduces the title exactly as it appears in the RH printing, but the statement of responsibility for the translator (TRANSLATED BY | ENNIS REES) and the imprint are reduced in size, significantly improving the balance and aesthetic appeal of the ML title page. The 3-line dedication facing the title page in the RH printing, which is identical to that in Rees’s translation ofThe Iliad, is shifted in the ML printing to the recto of the third leaf (p. [v]).
