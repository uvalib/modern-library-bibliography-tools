    "A comprehensive anthology that presents a striking picture of the intellectual development of the American negro. The volume contains short stories, significant excerpts from novels, essays, spirituals, poetry, and blues, and includes contributions by Booker T. Washington, Walter White, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Eric Walrond, Countee Cullen, and many others.  (Fall 1929)",
    "Original ML anthology. Published October 1929.WR23 November 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1944 by a revised edition edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins (372).",
    "When W. C. Handy authorized the inclusion of five blues he had copyrighted, he stipulated that copyright notices were to be printed on the same pages as the lyrics. Calverton acknowledged Handy generously in the preface but neglected to include the individual copyright notices. Handy or his representative contacted the ML shortly after publication, insisting that the agreement be honored. Klopfer contacted the ML’s legal counsel about the matter (Klopfer to Edwin A. Falk, 27 November 1929). He subsequently wrote to H. Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders, informing them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected sheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s truckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s stock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,” he stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly printed” (Klopfer to Miss J. A. Lanning, H. Wolff Estate, 26 December 1929). The corrected state of the first printing is described under 183a2.",

    "Negro achievement in the arts has kept pace with a change in intellectual conviction. Injustice and discrimination have proven a challenge, and that challenge is being answered with the literature produced by the colored race during the last decade. This anthology gives a comprehensive picture of the struggle of a people to affirm its own genius. It is representative of a new consciousness; it gives evidence of a determination to end the admission of inferiority and to begin to assert the unique and durable qualities of a race. (Fall 1933)",
