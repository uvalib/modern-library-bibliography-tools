    "Jacket:Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “Mr. Van Vechten’s most popular novel introduces a continuous procession of restless modern sophisticates—artists, writers, actors, and the like. They are drawn from life, and indeed, many of them appear under their own names.” (Fall 1929)",
    "Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp. [5]–247) printed from Knopf plates. Published November 1929.WR21 December 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.",
    "James Crowder, the ML’s midwestern sales representative, suggested the inclusion ofPeter Whiffle(Crowder to Cerf, 21 December 1928). At this time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering resentment over the ML edition ofGreen Mansions(90). However, Cerf had become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying to put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928). Relations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929 luncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy forPeter Whiffle. He also offered to pay Van Vechten $100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an introduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated that he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van Vechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf turned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929).Peter Whifflewas the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the ML.",
    "There was a second printing of 1,000 copies in August 1932."
