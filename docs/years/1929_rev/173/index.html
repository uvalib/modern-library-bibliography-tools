    "Merejkowski’s colossal trilogy, collectively entitledChrist and Anti-Christ, begins with the volumeThe Death of the Gods. It is a historical romance woven around Julian the Apostate, the first Roman emperor to be brought up in the Christian faith. The multi-colored background of the fourth century and the conflict for survival between paganism and Christianity provide Merejkowski with setting and theme for his most resplendent historical novel. (Spring 1936)",
