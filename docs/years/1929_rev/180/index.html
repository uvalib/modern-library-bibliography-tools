(Fall 1929) Front flap: To classifyThe Dance of Lifeas a book of philosophy, as a spiritual autobiography or even as a book of personal affirmations does it scant justice. It is all of these and more. It is a book of aspiration, of growth and of revelation, written by a man who has partaken of life and contributed to its wisdom, grace and idealism.The Dance of Lifemay be considered the crowning achievement of Havelock Ellis’s life; it epitomizes his spirit and his work. (Spring 1938) Originally published in U.S. by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1923.ML edition printed from Houghton Mifflin plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1929.WR26 October 1929. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959. In addition to the ML printing, the new plates were used for 1929 printings in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library and the Book League of America. A revised index keyed to the new typesetting appears in ML and Book League of America printings but not the Riverside Library printing, which ends on p. 342, the last page of text. The Book League of America contents page lists the index while the ML’s doesn’t. Ellis’s new foreword is unique to ML printings. The ML paid Houghton Mifflin an undetermined advance against royalties on the first 50,000 copies. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1931; printings reached 50,000 copies by October 1945. The Dance of Liferanked in the 3rd quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. 180b.
