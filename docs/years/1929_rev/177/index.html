    "From the time Honoré de Balzac pronounced Stendhal’s preeminence among the novelists of France until today, the author ofThe Red and the Blackhas retained and spread his influence among writers of every nationality. His story of Julien Sorel is incomparably the most astute and penetrating study of middle-class mores in all fiction. It is, in addition, a relentless dissection of the hypocrisy and opportunism of as unconscionable an upstart as ever violated the Seventh and other Commandments in order to get on in the world. (Spring 1933)",
    "Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Boni & Liveright, 1926. ML edition (pp. v–[288]; v–[352]) printed from B&L plates. Published June 1929.WR13 July 1929. First printing: 4,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissue format, 1984.",
    "The ML hyphenates the translator’s name as Scott-Moncrieff on the 177a title page and omits the hyphen in 177b‑e. Boni & Liveright was also inconsistent in its multi-volumeWorksof Stendhal, hyphenating the translator’s name on the title page ofThe Red and the Blackand omitting the hyphen on the title page ofThe Charterhouse of Parmaand the jackets of both works.",
    "The ML paid Liveright royalties of 10 cents a copy.",
    "The Red and the Blackranked high in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It rose to the first quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. The dramatic increase in sales may reflect use ofThe Red and the Blackin college literature courses after the Second World War, when enrollments increased dramatically as large numbers of veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill to earn college degrees.",

    "“True passion,” Stendhal wrote, “never thinks of anything but itself.” Based on an actual incident that Stendhal read about in theGazette desTribunauxin 1827,The Red and the Blackis a brilliant psychological portrait of passion, opportunism and political intrigue set in 19th-century Restoration France. It is the story of Julien Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois mores and French society,The Red and the Blackestablished Stendhal as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.",
