His story of Julien Sorel is incomparably the most astute and penetrating study of middle-class mores in all fiction. It is, in addition, a relentless dissection of the hypocrisy and opportunism of as unconscionable an upstart as ever violated the Seventh and other Commandments in order to get on in the world.

It is the story of Julien Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois mores and French society,The Red and the Blackestablished Stendhal as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century."
