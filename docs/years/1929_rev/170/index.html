    "Cerf invited Will Durant to write an introduction toSalammbôafter Durant’s publishers, Richard L. Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster, told him that Durant was an enthusiastic admirer of the work. Durant insisted on a fee of $100, twice what the ML usually paid, and then submitted a general essay on Flaubert. Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to me much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much too much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo. And what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story” (Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to Durant, 10 September 1928). Durant indicated that he didn’t have time to make changes, and the ML publishedSalammbôwithout an introduction.",
    "Four years afterSalammbôwas discontinued, James T. Farrell suggested Flaubert’sSentimentalEducationfor the ML (Farrell to Cerf, 1 February 1939). Cerf responded, “I am sorry to say that I see little point in adding another Flaubert title to the Modern Library at this time. We had to drop out both SALAMMBO and THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY because of complete lack of demand, and even MADAME BOVARY doesn’t sell one-quarter of what it did ten and fifteen years ago” (Cerf to Farrell, 2 February 1939).",
