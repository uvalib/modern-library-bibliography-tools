    "The rogues’ gallery of scoundrels and lusty wenches that gave flavor toRoderick RandomandPeregrine Pickleis matched by as humorous an array of delightful and cantankerous characters inHumphry Clinker. Here, too, are the caustic turns of speech, the sardonic wit and the acute powers of observation that have made Smollett’s books a plunder house for English writers during almost two centuries. And here, above all, is Smollett in a genial and mellow mood, but candid and outspoken, with the healthy frankness of the eighteenth century. (Fall 1936)",
    "ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published August 1929.WR14 September 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "Cerf wanted to include a volume of Machen’s stories in the ML and proposed the idea to him when he visited London in summer 1926.The Hill of DreamsandThe House of Soulswere in the U.S. public domain, but Machen, who badly needed the money a ML edition would bring, felt he could approve the proposal only if Alfred A. Knopf, his American publisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached Knopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He told Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an introduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s usual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf to Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated thatHumphry Clinker, “the work of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he thought thatRoderick Randomwas “more characteristically Smollett: rough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin with. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with his order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April 1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he wrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.",
    "Humphry Clinkerranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.",

    "The rogues’ gallery of ruffians and lusty wenches that gave so much color toRoderick RandomandPeregrine Pickleis matched by an array of cantankerous characters inHumphry Clinker. Here, in the last of his novels as in the others, are the wit and wisdom, the acute powers of observation, and the sharp turn of phrase that characterize all of Tobias Smollett’s work. Here is Smollett, grown tolerant of human frailty after having screamed against it inRoderick Random, now writing in the mellow, satiric vein of amiable elderly people in whom there is a hard core of eccentricity.Humphry Clinker, now almost two hundred years old, still retains the freshness and the vigor of the best of the eighteenth-century novels.
