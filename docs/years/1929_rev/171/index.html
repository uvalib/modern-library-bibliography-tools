    "Bindingand endpapervariants:The new binding design created by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April 1929, but Kent tested his design on copies of the first printing ofThe Brothers Karamazov, which was scheduled for publication in February.The Brothers Karamazovfirst appeared with Bernhard endpapers in balloon cloth binding A with spine lettering set from type. Copies of the first printing are also found in balloon cloth binding  with Kent’s grapevine design on the spine, his torchbearer in gold on the front panel, and the title and author on the spine stamped from lettering drawn by hand rather than set from metal type. There is also an intermediate stage between binding A and binding B1 which incorporates all elements of Kent’s design except hand lettering on the spine. Later printings appeared in balloon cloth bindings B2, with Kent’s torchbearer blind stamped on the front panel. The ML appears to have rejected Kent’s recommendation to employ letterers to create title and author statements for the binding spines of subsequent titles.",

    "Jacket B: Pictorial expressionist jacket in dark brown and bluish gray depicting an unclothed male figure with his head in his hand walking through a stylized landscape consisting of a flower, a combined moon and sun, and geometrical shapes. Signed: Hynd. (Spring 1929)Note:The ML experimented with several pictorial jackets in 1929 in connection with three boxed sets of three titles each that were intended for sale as Christmas gifts. The boxed sets, which were sold primarily in department stores, wereThree Great French Romances,Three Great Renaissance Romances, andThree Great Modern Novels. Hynd’s jackets for the volumes in theThree Great Modern Novelsgift box—Butler’sWay of All Flesh(13.1d jacket B) and Hardy’sReturn of the Native(126b jacket B) in addition toTheBrothers Karamazov—were exceptional examples of expressionist graphics. They were never adapted for use on regular ML printings.",

    "Friedrich Nietzsche paid Fyodor Dostoyevsky the supreme compliment of acknowledging him his teacher, for he learned from the Russian that even a great criminal could be a great man. Dostoyevsky’s understanding of every exaltation and humiliation of the human spirit, his profound tenderness and compassion, his intensity and psychological clairvoyance are nowhere so completely realized as inThe Brothers Karamazov. Here the mystic and the realist at last come into accord and give to the world this crowning achievement of Dostoyevsky’s tormented and almost fabulous life. (Fall 1933)",
    "Garnett translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1912. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1929.WR23 March 1929. First printing: 20,000. Discontinued 1971/72.",
    "Klopfer inquired about the possibility of printing the ML edition from Macmillan plates but was informed that the Macmillan Co. in New York used printed sheets imported from England (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 31 October 1928; Harold S. Latham, Macmillan, to Klopfer, 9 November 1928). Cerf and Klopfer decided to assume the cost of original composition and announced that the ML edition was the first to be printed in the United States. Other publishers, they noted, “always imported it from England rather than undergo the great expense of making a new set of plates for so lengthy a book” (ML circular, RH box 133, Advertising 1929 folder 2). At 988 pagesThe Brothers Karamazovwas longest book the ML had published up to that time.",
    "The Brothers Karamazovsold about 30,000 copies in its first two-and-a-half years in the ML (Cerf to Robert Linscott, 9 October 1931). It ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. In the early 1950s (November 1951–October 1952) it was the twelfth best-selling title in the ML; the Giant edition (G34) ranked in the second quarter of ML titles.",
    "The Brothers Karamazovwas one of four works to be published in the regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included in all three series were Cervantes,Don Quixote(1930: 197), Giant (1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Fielding,History of Tom Jones(1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943: IML 5); and Whitman,Poems(1921: 94.1), title changed toLeaves of Grass(1929),Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose(1951: 440);Leaves of Grass(Giant,1940: G48), Illus ML (1944: IML )",
