(Spring 1929) Front flap: The glory that was Greece is nowhere so luminously reflected as in the mirror of her drama. Through the masks of tragedy and comedy, nobility and villainy, and all the duality of the human spirit, the life of man glows to passion and grows dim. Pity and terror in Æschylus, serene detachment in Sophocles, burning fervor for justice in Euripides and the robust intellectual comedy of Aristophanes—these qualities remain the message and the meaning of Greek drama. It is a heritage from antiquity that the modern spirit needs. (Fall 1933) Original ML anthology. Publication announced for July 1929.WR14 September 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1951 bySeven Famous Greek Plays, ed. Whitney J. Oates and Eugene O’Neill, Jr. (439). Cerf wrote shortly after publication, “The Greek Plays has done nobly, and has thoroughly justified its inclusion in the series. I am still regretting the fact, however, that we did not get permission to use the Gilbert Murray translations” (Cerf to Landis, 8 May 1930). Twenty-two years later the ML used Murray’s translation ofThe FrogsinSeven Famous Greek Plays(439). Four Famous Greek Playsranked low in the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. 178b.
