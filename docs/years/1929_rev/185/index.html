    "The pursuit of women and adventure was the chief activity of Casanova’s life. Amorous and exciting exploits demanded all his energy and ability. When old age tempered his audacity, he retired to write the nostalgic recollections of his youthful prowess. The manuscript which has come down to us in various condensations has been the joy of those who cultivate delectable but forbidden pleasures, as it has been anathema and despair to prudes. The Modern Library edition includes the most vivid encounters and escapades of a glamorous life. (Fall 1936)",
    "Unidentified translation edited and probably abridged for the ML by Madeleine Boyd. Published November 1929.WR21 December 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.",
    "The ML sold exclusive reprint rights to the Madeleine Boyd edition to Garden City Publishing Co. for $1,500. The ML supplied duplicate plates (omitting the introduction) and retained all rights to publish its own edition (Robert F. de Graff, Garden City, to Cerf, 22 January 1932). A full-sized edition with illustrations by Victor Candell was published by Garden City later that year under the imprint Sun Dial Press.",
    "The Memoirs of Jacques Casanovaranked in the 3rd quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.",

    "The pursuit of women and adventure was the principal activity of Casanova’s life. By his own account, amorous and other exciting exploits demanded virtually all of his energy and resourcefulness. When old age tempered his passions, he retired to write the recollections of his youthful escapades. The manuscript which has come down to us from the eighteenth century in various condensations has delighted those readers who cultivate an interest in accounts of forbidden pleasures. It has also brought a little discomfort to the prudish-minded. This edition includes some of the most vivid encounters and escapades of Casanova’s crowded life. (Fall 1960)"
