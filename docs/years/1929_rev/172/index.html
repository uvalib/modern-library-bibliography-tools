Front flap: The problems of abnormal psychology are as manifold as the problems of modern life. To understand the origins and manifestations of the psychoses that afflict us, we must come to a better comprehension of the biological and social factors involved. This handbook gives an all–inclusive view of the interrelationship of mental diseases to the forces in modern life which cause them. Here eminent authorities speak in non–technical terms for the layman, that he may better understand the causes and consequences of a maladjusted mental equipment. (Spring 1939) Original ML anthology. Published February 1929.WR23 March 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded fall 1954 by revised edition (172.2). Cerf asked Everett Dean Martin of the New School for Social Research in 1926 if there was any chance of including his bookPsychology: What It Has to Teach You about Yourself and Your World(W. W. Norton, 1924) in the ML. If not, he asked whether Martin would be interested in compiling an anthology on psychology as a companion toAn Outline of Psychoanalysis(108). Martin replied negatively to both (Cerf to Martin, 21 September 1926; Martin to Cerf, 28 September 1926). Cerf turned next to Gardner Murphy, who received royalties of 5 cents a copy. An Outline of Abnormal Psychologysold 1,634 copies during the first six months of 1930 and 1,113 copies during the first six months of the following year. It ranked low in the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during 1951–52. 172.1b.

Signed: [Miriam] Woods. Front flap: Abnormality, as Hippocrates suggested centuries ago, is essentially a matter of defect or of exaggeration, and so the line between what is normal behavior and what is abnormal behavior is a thin, shifting one. In the study of the range of human variability lies a key to sympathetic understanding of those who suffer the tragedy of a sick, disturbed mind. In such study, too, lies a key to a greater capacity to understand one’s own emotional and social growth and thus to cope more skillfully with the endless problems, crises, and frustrations of everyday living. In this book, eminent authorities, using non-technical language, introduce the layman to the scope and the new horizons of abnormal psychology. (Fall 1954) Revised edition published fall 1954.WR16 October 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. Murphy wrote Cerf in 1953 that a revision ofAn Outline of Abnormal Psychologywas badly needed. He indicated that he had recently reviewed the selections in the 1929 edition and that in almost every instance it would be possible to select a superior example to represent current research and practice. He noted that he would need a collaborator who was familiar with fields in which he was not up-to-date (Murphy to Cerf, 14 January 1953). Stein replied four months later that the ML was planning revisions of several titles, includingAn Outline of Abnormal Psychology. He suggested that Murphy engage a collaborator for a flat fee of $300, which would be paid as an advance against Murphy’s royalties, and indicated that the ML would pay up to $300 for permissions. The royalty rate was to remain at 5 cents a copy (Stein to Murphy, 15 May 1953). Murphy thought that $500 should be the minimum fee for a collaborator but believed that permissions would be less than $300. Stein agreed to the $500 collaborator’s fee and reduced the permissions budget to $200 (Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953; Stein to Murphy, 29 May 1953). Murphy selected Bachrach as his collaborator. Bachrach made the preliminary selection of contents, and Murphy wrote a new introduction. The revised edition contained completely new material. The American Institute of Graphic Arts selectedAn Outline of Abnormal Psychologyas one of the fifty best books of 1954 (Fifty Books of the Year 1954: Catalog of the Thirty-third Annual Exhibition[New York: American Institute of Graphic Arts, 1955], p. 34). The book was designed by Peter Oldenburg and manufactured by H. Wolff Book Manufacturing Company.
