<div class="md-block"><h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1959</h1>
<h2>1959</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>During the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had
been immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a
steady upward climb. As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on
the verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959,
publishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book
Company, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin,
Macmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12
October 1959, p. 27).</p>
<p>On 2 October 1959, Random House became a public corporation: 222,060
shares of Random House stock were placed on sale at $11.25 a share. Cerf
and Klopfer remained firmly in control of the firm; the stock sold to
the public represented only 30 percent of Random House’s total stock. As
a result of the sale, Cerf and Klopfer each received a check for more
than a million dollars.</p>
<p>Making Random House a public organization changed the nature of the
business. Cerf has written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly Random House embarked on its financial career and expansion.
This marked a big change, since the minute you go public, outsiders
own some of your stock and you’ve got to make periodic reports to
them. You owe your investors dividends and profits. Instead of working
for yourself and doing what you damn please, willing to risk a loss on
something you want to do, if you’re any kind of honest man, you feel a
real responsibility to your stockholders. It was a very important
decision (Cerf, <em>At Random</em>, pp. 277–78).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following year, Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and its
outstanding quality paperback line, Vintage Books. But while Random
House and publishing in general were thriving, the 1950s marked the end
of the growth of the Modern Library. By the mid-1960s, interest in the
Modern Library on the part of the public was low and the series was in
serious trouble.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Ten titles were added and two were discontinued, bringing the total to
320.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with
the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.
The binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset
panels in black on the front cover and spine.</p>

<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>Jason Epstein, who moved from Alfred A. Knopf to Random House around
this time, had many ideas for the ML. He expressed interest in Samuel
Johnson’s <em>Lives of the Poets</em>. He asked William Barnett and Morton
White to edit a book on modern philosophy for ML Giants, indicating that
it could sell 15,000–20,000 copies a year (Epstein to White, 24 February
1959). Mark Van Doren, who had edited <em>The Poetry of John Dryden</em>
(Harcourt, Brace &amp; Howe, 1920) nearly forty years earlier, declined an
invitation to edit a collection of Dryden’s works for the ML (Van Doren
to Epstein, 20 May 1959). Epstein asked William Arrowsmith, whose
translation of Petronius, <em>Satyricon</em> (University of Michigan Press,
1959) had recently appeared, to translate <em>Aristophanes</em> for the ML,
indicating that he thought it would earn annual royalties between $500
and $1,000 (Epstein to Arrowsmith, 23 October 1959). He invited F. W.
Dupee to translate a selection of the works of the Marquis de Sade for
the ML; as a second choice he expressed interest in a translation of
Flaubert’s <em>Sentimental Education</em> (Epstein to Dupee, 17 November 1959).</p>
<p>Cerf wanted to include the one-volume edition of James George Frazer’s
<em>The Golden Bough</em> (Macmillan, 1922) in ML Giants and asked C. Edgar
Phreaner Jr. to seek rights (Phreaner to Cerf, 27 July 1959). He offered
Little, Brown an advance of $6,000 for Edith Hamilton, <em>Mythology</em>,
originally published in 1942 (Cerf to Arthur Thornhill, 26 October
1959), and he asked Professor William Alfred of Harvard University about
translations for a volume of Middle English literature for the ML,
saying “It would be a good idea, I think, for the Modern Library to
include an Anthology of this type” (Cerf to Alfred, 17 November 1959).
None of these works were added to the ML.</p>
<p>Several of Epstein’s suggestions resulted in additions to the series: <em>A
Kierkegaard Anthology</em> (1959: 518), Dickens, <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> (1960:
524), and the Bernard Guilbert Guerney translation of Turgenev, <em>Fathers
and Sons</em> (1917: 20.2a), which replaced the Constance Garnett
translation in the ML in 1961 (Epstein to Klopfer, 12 January 1959).
Other titles suggested by Epstein included Goodspeed’s translation of
<em>The Apocrypha</em> (1962: 541), <em>The Space Handbook</em> (ML Paperbacks,
November 1959), and Bernard Malamud’s <em>The Magic Barrel</em> (ML Paperbacks,
April 1960).</p>
<p>Epstein offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for
reprint rights to the William Arrowsmith translation of Petronius,
<em>Satyricon</em> (University of Michigan Press, 1959) but withdrew the offer
when he discovered that a paperback edition would be published by Mentor
Books (Epstein to Fred D. Wieck, 30 November 1959). <em>An Anthology of
Russian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak</em>, edited
by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, was considered for the ML but was published
in 1960 as a Random House trade book. Other titles considered included
E. M. W. Tillyard, <em>The Elizabethan World Picture</em>; Jacob Bronowski,
<em>The Common Sense of Science</em>; and <em>Five Plays</em> of Eugene O’Neill. <em>A
Documentary History of Communism</em>, edited by Robert V. Daniels, was
considered for the ML but was postponed (Minutes of ML Meeting, 5
February 1959); it ended up being published in two volumes in Vintage
Books.</p>
<p>Epstein wanted to strengthen the ML’s offerings of poetry. He suggested
volumes devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer, the Cavalier Poets (Thomas Carew,
Sir John Suckling, and Richard Lovelace) and collections of the poetry
of Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Samuel
Johnson, Christopher Smart, W. S. Landor, Robert Burns, Rudyard Kipling,
Thomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also suggested publishing
several longer poems as separate ML volumes, including Wordsworth’s <em>The
Prelude</em>, Browning’s <em>The Ring and the Book</em>, Edmund Spenser’s <em>The
Faerie Queen</em>, and the narrative poems of William Butler Yeats (Epstein
to Andrew Chiappe, 6 February 1959). None of these proposals came to
fruition.</p>
<p>Charles Singleton, professor of humanities studies at Johns Hopkins
University, signed a contract to prepare a new translation of Dante’s
<em>Divine Comedy</em> for the ML, for which he received a $3,000 advance
against royalties of 6½ percent of the retail price. In the end the
project took longer than expected and expanded beyond the single volume
that the ML anticipated. Singleton’s edition was published in six
volumes by Princeton University Press between 1970 and 1975. Each of the
three parts—<em>Inferno</em>, <em>Purgatorio</em>, and *Paradiso—*consisted of a
volume containing the Italian text and Singleton’s translation and a
volume of commentary by Singleton.</p>
<p>Epstein was also looking for new translations of several works that were
already in the ML. The Ennis Rees translations of Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> (1929:
186.2) and <em>Odyssey</em> (1929: 187.2), published by Random House in 1960
and 1963, replaced the 19th-century translations of Lang, Leaf and Myers
and Butcher and Lang in the ML between 1962 and 1964. The Samuel Putnam
translation of Cervantes, <em>Don Quixote</em>, published by Viking Press in
two volumes in 1949, replaced the Ozell revision of the Motteux
translation in 1964 in the regular ML and ML Giants.</p>
<p>Other works that Epstein wanted to include in the ML were <em>Hindu,
Buddhist, and Confucian Traditions</em> by Theodore de Bary, <em>Japanese
Plays</em> by Donald Keene, and the forthcoming edition of Pushkin’s <em>Eugene
Onegin,</em> translated with commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (Bollingen
Foundation, 1964). Also being sought were new translations of Homer’s
<em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Iliad</em> and the University of Chicago’s translations of
Greek Drama (Epstein to Cerf, 3 September 1959). The ML reprinted the
Chicago edition of <em>The Complete Greek Tragedies</em> in seven volumes
between 1960 and 1963.</p>
<p>Andrew Chiappe suggested Livy’s <em>Hannibal’s Campaign</em>, Tolstoy’s
<em>Essays</em>, Balzac’s <em>Lost Illusions</em>, and Terence’s <em>Comedies</em> (Chiappe,
November 1959). Epstein intended to add Sir Philip Sidney’s <em>Arcadia</em>,
for which he paid William G. Miller $500 for editing work (Epstein to
Miller 9 November 1959). Of these only Tolstoy, <em>Selected Essays</em> (1964:
564) and Balzac, <em>Lost Illusions</em> (1967: G109) appeared in the ML.</p>
<p>Klopfer asked Macmillan for reprint rights to Margaret Mitchell’s <em>Gone
with the Wind</em> for ML Giants. Macmillan considered the offer seriously
but Bruce Brett, the president of the firm, concluded that “this is not
the time for it” (Brett to Klopfer, 15 December 1959).</p>
<p>John Clive, whose <em>Macaulay: The Shaping of a Historian</em> would be
published by Knopf in 1973, suggested a ML selection of Macaulay’s
works. Epstein declined the proposal, noting that ML titles had to sell
“a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 copies a year for a considerable period,
which means that it has to be assigned to undergraduates in fairly
substantial numbers” (Epstein to Clive, 15 September 1959).</p>

This dictionary has been prepared with the general reader specifically
in mind. It provides reliable, clear, and concise information on
practically all the words he is likely to look up—information on
spelling, hyphenation, pronunciation, meaning, inflected forms, and
numerous other aspects of the English language.</p>
<p><em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> is based on <em>The American College
Dictionary</em>, widely acclaimed as the most distinguished dictionary of
its kind ever published. New and up to date, The Modern Library
Dictionary is an indispensable and authoritative ready-reference work.</p>
<p>Unlike most old-fashioned dictionaries, this book is easily used and
easily understood. Durably bound, it will readily absorb the constant
use which its compact and handy size invites. (<em>Spring 1959)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B</em>: As jacket A with ML number “1” on backstrip. (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML dictionary based on <em>The American College Dictionary</em>,
published by Random House in 1947. Published February 1959. <em>WR</em> 23
February 1959. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Cerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as
1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a
duplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William
Targ, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May
1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the <em>American College
Dictionary</em> in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By
deleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the
content to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the
dictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the
<em>American College Dictionary</em> by 50 percent would require making much
sharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a
Giant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with <em>The
Concise Oxford Dictionary</em>, the Funk and Wagnalls <em>Desk Standard
Dictionary</em>, and the <em>Winston Advanced Dictionary</em> (School Edition). He
estimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and
that editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott,
18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans
to publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. <em>The</em> <em>Modern
Library Dictionary</em> (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000
entries.</p>
<p><em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall
1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A,
1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because
new business machines acquired by Random House could not handle
number-letter combinations. Copies of <em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em>
that remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number
“1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.</p>
<p>The <em>First</em> statement on the verso of the title page appears to have
been removed on all subsequent printings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
Of the great modern poets, no one is held in greater esteem than W. H.
Auden. In the opinion of many, he is regarded as the foremost poet of
our time.</p>
<p>It is with particular pride, therefore, that the publishers of the
Modern Library make this book available to the large number of readers
who have long wished for such a volume.</p>
<p>This book contains a generous selection of Auden’s poetry. Here the
reader will find constant enjoyment in the spirited wit, the
wide-ranging intellect, the emotional power, and the unsurpassed
artistry that are among Auden’s characteristics. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in Britain as <em>W. H. Auden: A Selection by the
Author</em> (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from
a new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. <em>WR</em> 23 February 1959.
First printing: 7,500 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for
the ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of
<em>The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden</em> which Random House published in
1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer
turned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in
Vintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback
edition because <em>Collected Poetry</em> was selling so well (Klopfer to
Alfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).</p>
<p>The ML reprinted <em>W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author</em> because Auden
did not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered
buying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S.
copyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been
set in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention,
which the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement
for works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S.
citizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer
wrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might
invalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance”
(Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set
of proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of
uncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the
Penguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7
July 1958).</p>
<p>Auden included the following note on p. [<em>8</em>] following the table of
contents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the
chronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the
last from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony
or sense or both”.</p>
<p>The ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson
report a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings
of 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two
printings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and
7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
The fabulously successful musical plays of Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein II—<em>Oklahoma!</em>, <em>Carousel</em>, <em>Allegro</em>, <em>South Pacific</em>,
<em>The King and I</em>, and <em>Me and Juliet</em> —are a treasured part of
everyone’s life. These great plays and their unforgettable music have
probably brought more excitement and delight to people around the
world than have any others in our time.</p>
<p>Always tastefully rich in originality and showmanship, these musical
comedies by Rodgers and Hammerstein are loved for their enduring
enchantment. No one, whether he has seen these plays performed or not,
will want to deprive himself of the pleasure of reading these works at
his leisure again and again. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Few modern writers share the remarkable talent of Jerome Weidman—a
talent for telling a story with brightly-lit realism, for depicting
characters with extraordinary sharpness and insight, and for inciting
the reader to agree or disagree (vehemently in either case) with his
viewpoint.</p>
<p>Among the best of Weidman’s novels is <em>I Can Get It For You
Wholesale</em>, the story of Harry Bogen, who climbs ruthlessly to power
and wealth without concern for those he uses or hurts. This novel,
commended by the <em>New York Times</em> as “racy, fresh and continuously
interesting,” is one that all readers will want to know and that none
will ever forget. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>

Dr. C. G. Jung, whose ideas have exerted great influence upon all

<p>The publication of this volume of basic writings, skillfully edited by
Violet de Laszlo, provides for the first time a means by which general

<p>Clifton Fadiman suggested a volume of Jung’s writings in 1956. He had
received a letter which stated: “You may know those who select the
titles for Modern Library Editions. Could you persuade them to publish
some of Dr. C. G. Jung’s writings. They are so scattered it is difficult
to obtain the more important parts.” Fadiman commented, “Not as crazy as
it sounds—the Jung cult is fairly large, the name better and better
known, and the Bollingen translations are good and easily buyable from
Kurt [Wolff, the founder of Pantheon Books]” (Fadiman to Klopfer, 13
April 1956). Klopfer replied, “We have been negotiating with the
Bollingen people for months, and expect to have a title in the Modern
Library in 1957” (Klopfer to Fadiman, 20 April 1956).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
The question, “What is society?” is one that was pondered long before
there was such a word as <em>sociology</em>. This book shows some of the ways
men in all ages have dealt with this question and others concerning
man’s relations with his fellow-men. The range is from Plato and
Aristotle to the recent leading figures—Znaniecki, Park, Sorokin,
MacIver, Mannheim, Lundberg, Becker, Parsons—and the Introduction by
Robert Bierstedt traces, clearly and concisely, the history of
sociological theory and concludes with a statement about the problems
sociologists are most concerned with today. (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
One evening, in the year 1546, Giorgio Vasari, a Florentine painter
and architect, was dining in Rome with the celebrated Cardinal
Farnese. The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need
was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of
Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should
undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”</p>
<p>Four years later <em>Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and
Architects</em> was published in Florence. The time and the man had come
together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a
great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian
Renaissance.</p>
<p>Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of
the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as
the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything
considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (<em>Fall
1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London
by the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959. <em>WR</em>
19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Linscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He
originally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs.
Jonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the
DeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser
translation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000
words.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the
manuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s
worth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates”
(Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume
DeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the
U.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of
pictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable
moralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential
Vasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to
change the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has
been done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a
building it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American
readers” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).</p>
<p>Linscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he
thought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to
Cerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and
an expensive illustrated edition by S &amp; S [Simon and Schuster] with
disgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print.
Instead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff,
inaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly
accurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br>
Pick up this book and start reading a story, any story. Choose from
intriguing titles like “A Perfect Day for Bananafish” or “For
Esmé—With Love and Squalor,” and start anywhere. Chances are that you
will be in on a conversation, one so fresh and immediate that you will
seem to be hearing, not reading it. You have entered the world of
J. D. Salinger, and you will continue reading until you have finished
all nine stories. Who are these extraordinary people, these grave and
knowing children, what is happening to them, what are they revealing
about past events, about themselves, about their dealings with each
other and the world? The author does not tell you directly but you
find out for yourself from their every word, gesture, and act.</p>
<p>When you have finished, you will understand why Arthur Mizener
recently called Salinger “probably the most avidly read author of any
serious pretensions in his generation,” and his work “the most
interesting fiction that has come along for some time.” (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1953. ML edition (pp.
[<em>5</em>]–302) printed from Little, Brown plates with decorative rules
removed from table of contents, fly title and chapter heads in all
printings of 516a. Published September 1959. <em>WR</em> 28 September 1959.
First printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65.</p>
<p>Cerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped <em>Nine Stories</em> could be
included in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He
subsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint <em>The</em> <em>Catcher in
the Rye</em> (504) and <em>Nine Stories</em> in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger
asked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the
entry for <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the
president of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal
notice that termination of the <em>Nine Stories</em> contract would become
effective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to
dispose of any copies on hand.</p>
<p>The Little, Brown half title (<em>Nine Stories</em>) is sandwiched between two
decorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “<em>by</em>
J. D. <span class="smallcaps">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The
ML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | <em>OF THE WORLD’S
BEST BOOKS</em> followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line
statement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated
folder listing each volume in the series.</p>
<p>Printings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960),
15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing
in spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of <em>Nine Stories</em> are
included in the entry for <em>The</em> <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> (1958: 504).</p>
<p>The ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s
books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering
hope that Salinger might change his mind. <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and <em>Nine
Stories</em> were listed in <em>Publishers’ Trade List Annual</em> through 1965 and
continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through
1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new
titles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of <em>Nine
Stories</em>, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when
<em>Renaissance Philosophy</em>, vol. 2*: The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611)
was published as ML 301*.*</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br>
This anthology covers the whole of Kierkegaard’s literary career. The
selections range from the terse epigrams of the <em>Journal</em> through the
famous “Diary of the Seducer” and the “Banquet” scene, in which S. K.
reveals his great lyric and dramatic gifts, on to the philosophical
and psychological works of his maturity. These are climaxed by the
beautiful and moving religious discourses which accompany them;
finally there is the biting satire of his <em>Attack upon</em>
“<em>Christendom</em>.”</p>
<p>This is emphatically not a collection of “snippets,” but the cream of
Kierkegaard, each selection interesting and intelligible in itself,
and all ranking among his most important work. As the <em>New York Herald
Tribune</em> commented, Mr. Bretall “has let Kierkegaard speak for himself
. . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the
prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what
such remarks should be.” (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>

  "full": "# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1959\n\n## 1959\n\n### General\n\nDuring the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had\nbeen immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a\nsteady upward climb. As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on\nthe verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959,\npublishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book\nCompany, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin,\nMacmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12\nOctober 1959, p. 27).\n\nOn 2 October 1959, Random House became a public corporation: 222,060\nshares of Random House stock were placed on sale at $11.25 a share. Cerf\nand Klopfer remained firmly in control of the firm; the stock sold to\nthe public represented only 30 percent of Random House’s total stock. As\na result of the sale, Cerf and Klopfer each received a check for more\nthan a million dollars.\n\nMaking Random House a public organization changed the nature of the\nbusiness. Cerf has written:\n\n> Suddenly Random House embarked on its financial career and expansion.\n> This marked a big change, since the minute you go public, outsiders\n> own some of your stock and you’ve got to make periodic reports to\n> them. You owe your investors dividends and profits. Instead of working\n> for yourself and doing what you damn please, willing to risk a loss on\n> something you want to do, if you’re any kind of honest man, you feel a\n> real responsibility to your stockholders. It was a very important\n> decision (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 277–78).\n\nThe following year, Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and its\noutstanding quality paperback line, Vintage Books. But while Random\nHouse and publishing in general were thriving, the 1950s marked the end\nof the growth of the Modern Library. By the mid-1960s, interest in the\nModern Library on the part of the public was low and the series was in\nserious trouble.\n\n### Number of titles\n\nTen titles were added and two were discontinued, bringing the total to\n320.\n\n### Format\n\nAll new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with\nthe Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.\nThe binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset\npanels in black on the front cover and spine.\n\n### Price\n\n$1.65### Dating keys\n\n(Spring) Auden, *Selected Poetry* xSalinger, *Nine Stories*; Giants\nthrough G82 with G38 Rolland, *Jean-Christophe* (=fall 1959/spring\n1960); jackets: 385. (Fall) Salinger, *Nine Stories* xColette, *Six\nNovels*; Giants through G82 with G38 Rolland, *Jean-Christophe* (=spring\n1959/spring 1960); jackets: 388 (=spring 1960).\n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined\n\nJason Epstein, who moved from Alfred A. Knopf to Random House around\nthis time, had many ideas for the ML. He expressed interest in Samuel\nJohnson’s *Lives of the Poets*. He asked William Barnett and Morton\nWhite to edit a book on modern philosophy for ML Giants, indicating that\nit could sell 15,000–20,000 copies a year (Epstein to White, 24 February\n1959). Mark Van Doren, who had edited *The Poetry of John Dryden*\n(Harcourt, Brace & Howe, 1920) nearly forty years earlier, declined an\ninvitation to edit a collection of Dryden’s works for the ML (Van Doren\nto Epstein, 20 May 1959). Epstein asked William Arrowsmith, whose\ntranslation of Petronius, *Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press,\n1959) had recently appeared, to translate *Aristophanes* for the ML,\nindicating that he thought it would earn annual royalties between $500\nand $1,000 (Epstein to Arrowsmith, 23 October 1959). He invited F. W.\nDupee to translate a selection of the works of the Marquis de Sade for\nthe ML; as a second choice he expressed interest in a translation of\nFlaubert’s *Sentimental Education* (Epstein to Dupee, 17 November 1959).\n\nCerf wanted to include the one-volume edition of James George Frazer’s\n*The Golden Bough* (Macmillan, 1922) in ML Giants and asked C. Edgar\nPhreaner Jr. to seek rights (Phreaner to Cerf, 27 July 1959). He offered\nLittle, Brown an advance of $6,000 for Edith Hamilton, *Mythology*,\noriginally published in 1942 (Cerf to Arthur Thornhill, 26 October\n1959), and he asked Professor William Alfred of Harvard University about\ntranslations for a volume of Middle English literature for the ML,\nsaying “It would be a good idea, I think, for the Modern Library to\ninclude an Anthology of this type” (Cerf to Alfred, 17 November 1959).\nNone of these works were added to the ML.\n\nSeveral of Epstein’s suggestions resulted in additions to the series: *A\nKierkegaard Anthology* (1959: 518), Dickens, *Our Mutual Friend* (1960:\n524), and the Bernard Guilbert Guerney translation of Turgenev, *Fathers\nand Sons* (1917: 20.2a), which replaced the Constance Garnett\ntranslation in the ML in 1961 (Epstein to Klopfer, 12 January 1959).\nOther titles suggested by Epstein included Goodspeed’s translation of\n*The Apocrypha* (1962: 541), *The Space Handbook* (ML Paperbacks,\nNovember 1959), and Bernard Malamud’s *The Magic Barrel* (ML Paperbacks,\nApril 1960).\n\nEpstein offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for\nreprint rights to the William Arrowsmith translation of Petronius,\n*Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press, 1959) but withdrew the offer\nwhen he discovered that a paperback edition would be published by Mentor\nBooks (Epstein to Fred D. Wieck, 30 November 1959). *An Anthology of\nRussian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak*, edited\nby Bernard Guilbert Guerney, was considered for the ML but was published\nin 1960 as a Random House trade book. Other titles considered included\nE. M. W. Tillyard, *The Elizabethan World Picture*; Jacob Bronowski,\n*The Common Sense of Science*; and *Five Plays* of Eugene O’Neill. *A\nDocumentary History of Communism*, edited by Robert V. Daniels, was\nconsidered for the ML but was postponed (Minutes of ML Meeting, 5\nFebruary 1959); it ended up being published in two volumes in Vintage\nBooks.\n\nEpstein wanted to strengthen the ML’s offerings of poetry. He suggested\nvolumes devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer, the Cavalier Poets (Thomas Carew,\nSir John Suckling, and Richard Lovelace) and collections of the poetry\nof Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Samuel\nJohnson, Christopher Smart, W. S. Landor, Robert Burns, Rudyard Kipling,\nThomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also suggested publishing\nseveral longer poems as separate ML volumes, including Wordsworth’s *The\nPrelude*, Browning’s *The Ring and the Book*, Edmund Spenser’s *The\nFaerie Queen*, and the narrative poems of William Butler Yeats (Epstein\nto Andrew Chiappe, 6 February 1959). None of these proposals came to\nfruition.\n\nCharles Singleton, professor of humanities studies at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, signed a contract to prepare a new translation of Dante’s\n*Divine Comedy* for the ML, for which he received a $3,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 6½ percent of the retail price. In the end the\nproject took longer than expected and expanded beyond the single volume\nthat the ML anticipated. Singleton’s edition was published in six\nvolumes by Princeton University Press between 1970 and 1975. Each of the\nthree parts—*Inferno*, *Purgatorio*, and *Paradiso—*consisted of a\nvolume containing the Italian text and Singleton’s translation and a\nvolume of commentary by Singleton.\n\nEpstein was also looking for new translations of several works that were\nalready in the ML. The Ennis Rees translations of Homer’s *Iliad* (1929:\n186.2) and *Odyssey* (1929: 187.2), published by Random House in 1960\nand 1963, replaced the 19th-century translations of Lang, Leaf and Myers\nand Butcher and Lang in the ML between 1962 and 1964. The Samuel Putnam\ntranslation of Cervantes, *Don Quixote*, published by Viking Press in\ntwo volumes in 1949, replaced the Ozell revision of the Motteux\ntranslation in 1964 in the regular ML and ML Giants.\n\nOther works that Epstein wanted to include in the ML were *Hindu,\nBuddhist, and Confucian Traditions* by Theodore de Bary, *Japanese\nPlays* by Donald Keene, and the forthcoming edition of Pushkin’s *Eugene\nOnegin,* translated with commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (Bollingen\nFoundation, 1964). Also being sought were new translations of Homer’s\n*Odyssey* and *Iliad* and the University of Chicago’s translations of\nGreek Drama (Epstein to Cerf, 3 September 1959). The ML reprinted the\nChicago edition of *The Complete Greek Tragedies* in seven volumes\nbetween 1960 and 1963.\n\nAndrew Chiappe suggested Livy’s *Hannibal’s Campaign*, Tolstoy’s\n*Essays*, Balzac’s *Lost Illusions*, and Terence’s *Comedies* (Chiappe,\nNovember 1959). Epstein intended to add Sir Philip Sidney’s *Arcadia*,\nfor which he paid William G. Miller $500 for editing work (Epstein to\nMiller 9 November 1959). Of these only Tolstoy, *Selected Essays* (1964:\n564) and Balzac, *Lost Illusions* (1967: G109) appeared in the ML.\n\nKlopfer asked Macmillan for reprint rights to Margaret Mitchell’s *Gone\nwith the Wind* for ML Giants. Macmillan considered the offer seriously\nbut Bruce Brett, the president of the firm, concluded that “this is not\nthe time for it” (Brett to Klopfer, 15 December 1959).\n\nJohn Clive, whose *Macaulay: The Shaping of a Historian* would be\npublished by Knopf in 1973, suggested a ML selection of Macaulay’s\nworks. Epstein declined the proposal, noting that ML titles had to sell\n“a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 copies a year for a considerable period,\nwhich means that it has to be assigned to undergraduates in fairly\nsubstantial numbers” (Epstein to Clive, 15 September 1959).\n\n### New titles\n\n*Modern Library Dictionary* (1959–1970) 509\n\nAuden, *Selected Poetry* (1959–1971) 510\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein, *Six Plays* (1959– ) 511\n\nWeidman, *I Can Get It for You Wholesale* (1959–1971) 512\n\nJung, *Basic Writings* (1959– ) 513\n\nBierstedt, ed., *Making of Society* (1959–1974) 514\n\nVasari, *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects*\n(1959–1970) 515\n\nSalinger, *Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516\n\nHoward, *World’s Great Operas* (1959–1970) 517\n\nKierkegaard, *Kierkegaard Anthology* (1959– ) 518### Discontinued\n\nHoffenstein, *Complete Poetry of Samuel Hoffenstein* (1954)\n\nMcCord, ed., *What Cheer* (1955)\n\n***Spring***\n\n### 509\n\n**JESS STEIN, ed.

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as\n1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a\nduplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William\nTarg, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May\n1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the *American College\nDictionary* in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By\ndeleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the\ncontent to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the\ndictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the\n*American College Dictionary* by 50 percent would require making much\nsharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a\nGiant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with *The\nConcise Oxford Dictionary*, the Funk and Wagnalls *Desk Standard\nDictionary*, and the *Winston Advanced Dictionary* (School Edition). He\nestimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and\nthat editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott,\n18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans\nto publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. *The* *Modern\nLibrary Dictionary* (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000\nentries.\n\n*The Modern Library Dictionary* was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall\n1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A,\n1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because\nnew business machines acquired by Random House could not handle\nnumber-letter combinations. Copies of *The Modern Library Dictionary*\nthat remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number\n“1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.\n\nThe *First* statement on the verso of the title page appears to have\nbeen removed on all subsequent printings.\n\n### 510\n\n**W. H. AUDEN.

Here the\n> reader will find constant enjoyment in the spirited wit, the\n> wide-ranging intellect, the emotional power, and the unsurpassed\n> artistry that are among Auden’s characteristics. (*Spring 1959*)\n\nOriginally published in Britain as *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the\nAuthor* (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from\na new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. *WR* 23 February 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500 copies.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for\nthe ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of\n*The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden* which Random House published in\n1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer\nturned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in\nVintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback\nedition because *Collected Poetry* was selling so well (Klopfer to\nAlfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).\n\nThe ML reprinted *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* because Auden\ndid not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered\nbuying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S.\ncopyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been\nset in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention,\nwhich the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement\nfor works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S.\ncitizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer\nwrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might\ninvalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance”\n(Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set\nof proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of\nuncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the\nPenguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7\nJuly 1958).\n\nAuden included the following note on p. \\[*8*\\] following the table of\ncontents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the\nchronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the\nlast from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony\nor sense or both”.\n\nThe ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson\nreport a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings\nof 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two\nprintings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and\n7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969).\n\n#### 510b.

The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need\n> was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of\n> Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should\n> undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”\n>\n> Four years later *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and\n> Architects* was published in Florence. The time and the man had come\n> together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a\n> great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian\n> Renaissance.\n>\n> Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of\n> the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as\n> the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything\n> considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (*Fall\n> 1959*)\n\nML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London\nby the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15).

He\noriginally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs.\nJonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the\nDeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser\ntranslation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000\nwords.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the\nmanuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s\nworth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates”\n(Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume\nDeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the\nU.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of\npictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable\nmoralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential\nVasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to\nchange the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has\nbeen done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a\nbuilding it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American\nreaders” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).\n\nLinscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he\nthought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to\nCerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and\nan expensive illustrated edition by S & S \\[Simon and Schuster\\] with\ndisgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print.\nInstead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff,\ninaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly\naccurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).\n\n### 516\n\n**J.

Published September 1959. *WR* 28 September 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65.\n\nCerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped *Nine Stories* could be\nincluded in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He\nsubsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint *The* *Catcher in\nthe Rye* (504) and *Nine Stories* in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger\nasked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the\nentry for *The Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the\npresident of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal\nnotice that termination of the *Nine Stories* contract would become\neffective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to\ndispose of any copies on hand.\n\nThe Little, Brown half title (*Nine Stories*) is sandwiched between two\ndecorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “*by*\nJ. D. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The\nML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | *OF THE WORLD’S\nBEST BOOKS* followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line\nstatement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated\nfolder listing each volume in the series.\n\nPrintings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960),\n15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing\nin spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of *Nine Stories* are\nincluded in the entry for *The* *Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504).\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of *Nine\nStories*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when\n*Renaissance Philosophy*, vol. 2*: The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611)\nwas published as ML 301*.*\n\n#### 516b.

  "general": "During the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had\nbeen immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a\nsteady upward climb. As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on\nthe verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959,\npublishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book\nCompany, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin,\nMacmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12\nOctober 1959, p. 27).\n\nOn 2 October 1959, Random House became a public corporation: 222,060\nshares of Random House stock were placed on sale at $11.25 a share. Cerf\nand Klopfer remained firmly in control of the firm; the stock sold to\nthe public represented only 30 percent of Random House’s total stock. As\na result of the sale, Cerf and Klopfer each received a check for more\nthan a million dollars.\n\nMaking Random House a public organization changed the nature of the\nbusiness. Cerf has written:\n\n> Suddenly Random House embarked on its financial career and expansion.\n> This marked a big change, since the minute you go public, outsiders\n> own some of your stock and you’ve got to make periodic reports to\n> them. You owe your investors dividends and profits. Instead of working\n> for yourself and doing what you damn please, willing to risk a loss on\n> something you want to do, if you’re any kind of honest man, you feel a\n> real responsibility to your stockholders. It was a very important\n> decision (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 277–78).\n\nThe following year, Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and its\noutstanding quality paperback line, Vintage Books. But while Random\nHouse and publishing in general were thriving, the 1950s marked the end\nof the growth of the Modern Library. By the mid-1960s, interest in the\nModern Library on the part of the public was low and the series was in\nserious trouble.",

  "titlesSoughtSuggestedDeclined": "Jason Epstein, who moved from Alfred A. Knopf to Random House around\nthis time, had many ideas for the ML. He expressed interest in Samuel\nJohnson’s *Lives of the Poets*. He asked William Barnett and Morton\nWhite to edit a book on modern philosophy for ML Giants, indicating that\nit could sell 15,000–20,000 copies a year (Epstein to White, 24 February\n1959). Mark Van Doren, who had edited *The Poetry of John Dryden*\n(Harcourt, Brace & Howe, 1920) nearly forty years earlier, declined an\ninvitation to edit a collection of Dryden’s works for the ML (Van Doren\nto Epstein, 20 May 1959). Epstein asked William Arrowsmith, whose\ntranslation of Petronius, *Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press,\n1959) had recently appeared, to translate *Aristophanes* for the ML,\nindicating that he thought it would earn annual royalties between $500\nand $1,000 (Epstein to Arrowsmith, 23 October 1959). He invited F. W.\nDupee to translate a selection of the works of the Marquis de Sade for\nthe ML; as a second choice he expressed interest in a translation of\nFlaubert’s *Sentimental Education* (Epstein to Dupee, 17 November 1959).\n\nCerf wanted to include the one-volume edition of James George Frazer’s\n*The Golden Bough* (Macmillan, 1922) in ML Giants and asked C. Edgar\nPhreaner Jr. to seek rights (Phreaner to Cerf, 27 July 1959). He offered\nLittle, Brown an advance of $6,000 for Edith Hamilton, *Mythology*,\noriginally published in 1942 (Cerf to Arthur Thornhill, 26 October\n1959), and he asked Professor William Alfred of Harvard University about\ntranslations for a volume of Middle English literature for the ML,\nsaying “It would be a good idea, I think, for the Modern Library to\ninclude an Anthology of this type” (Cerf to Alfred, 17 November 1959).\nNone of these works were added to the ML.\n\nSeveral of Epstein’s suggestions resulted in additions to the series: *A\nKierkegaard Anthology* (1959: 518), Dickens, *Our Mutual Friend* (1960:\n524), and the Bernard Guilbert Guerney translation of Turgenev, *Fathers\nand Sons* (1917: 20.2a), which replaced the Constance Garnett\ntranslation in the ML in 1961 (Epstein to Klopfer, 12 January 1959).\nOther titles suggested by Epstein included Goodspeed’s translation of\n*The Apocrypha* (1962: 541), *The Space Handbook* (ML Paperbacks,\nNovember 1959), and Bernard Malamud’s *The Magic Barrel* (ML Paperbacks,\nApril 1960).\n\nEpstein offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for\nreprint rights to the William Arrowsmith translation of Petronius,\n*Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press, 1959) but withdrew the offer\nwhen he discovered that a paperback edition would be published by Mentor\nBooks (Epstein to Fred D. Wieck, 30 November 1959). *An Anthology of\nRussian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak*, edited\nby Bernard Guilbert Guerney, was considered for the ML but was published\nin 1960 as a Random House trade book. Other titles considered included\nE. M. W. Tillyard, *The Elizabethan World Picture*; Jacob Bronowski,\n*The Common Sense of Science*; and *Five Plays* of Eugene O’Neill. *A\nDocumentary History of Communism*, edited by Robert V. Daniels, was\nconsidered for the ML but was postponed (Minutes of ML Meeting, 5\nFebruary 1959); it ended up being published in two volumes in Vintage\nBooks.\n\nEpstein wanted to strengthen the ML’s offerings of poetry. He suggested\nvolumes devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer, the Cavalier Poets (Thomas Carew,\nSir John Suckling, and Richard Lovelace) and collections of the poetry\nof Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Samuel\nJohnson, Christopher Smart, W. S. Landor, Robert Burns, Rudyard Kipling,\nThomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also suggested publishing\nseveral longer poems as separate ML volumes, including Wordsworth’s *The\nPrelude*, Browning’s *The Ring and the Book*, Edmund Spenser’s *The\nFaerie Queen*, and the narrative poems of William Butler Yeats (Epstein\nto Andrew Chiappe, 6 February 1959). None of these proposals came to\nfruition.\n\nCharles Singleton, professor of humanities studies at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, signed a contract to prepare a new translation of Dante’s\n*Divine Comedy* for the ML, for which he received a $3,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 6½ percent of the retail price. In the end the\nproject took longer than expected and expanded beyond the single volume\nthat the ML anticipated. Singleton’s edition was published in six\nvolumes by Princeton University Press between 1970 and 1975. Each of the\nthree parts—*Inferno*, *Purgatorio*, and *Paradiso—*consisted of a\nvolume containing the Italian text and Singleton’s translation and a\nvolume of commentary by Singleton.\n\nEpstein was also looking for new translations of several works that were\nalready in the ML. The Ennis Rees translations of Homer’s *Iliad* (1929:\n186.2) and *Odyssey* (1929: 187.2), published by Random House in 1960\nand 1963, replaced the 19th-century translations of Lang, Leaf and Myers\nand Butcher and Lang in the ML between 1962 and 1964. The Samuel Putnam\ntranslation of Cervantes, *Don Quixote*, published by Viking Press in\ntwo volumes in 1949, replaced the Ozell revision of the Motteux\ntranslation in 1964 in the regular ML and ML Giants.\n\nOther works that Epstein wanted to include in the ML were *Hindu,\nBuddhist, and Confucian Traditions* by Theodore de Bary, *Japanese\nPlays* by Donald Keene, and the forthcoming edition of Pushkin’s *Eugene\nOnegin,* translated with commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (Bollingen\nFoundation, 1964). Also being sought were new translations of Homer’s\n*Odyssey* and *Iliad* and the University of Chicago’s translations of\nGreek Drama (Epstein to Cerf, 3 September 1959). The ML reprinted the\nChicago edition of *The Complete Greek Tragedies* in seven volumes\nbetween 1960 and 1963.\n\nAndrew Chiappe suggested Livy’s *Hannibal’s Campaign*, Tolstoy’s\n*Essays*, Balzac’s *Lost Illusions*, and Terence’s *Comedies* (Chiappe,\nNovember 1959). Epstein intended to add Sir Philip Sidney’s *Arcadia*,\nfor which he paid William G. Miller $500 for editing work (Epstein to\nMiller 9 November 1959). Of these only Tolstoy, *Selected Essays* (1964:\n564) and Balzac, *Lost Illusions* (1967: G109) appeared in the ML.\n\nKlopfer asked Macmillan for reprint rights to Margaret Mitchell’s *Gone\nwith the Wind* for ML Giants. Macmillan considered the offer seriously\nbut Bruce Brett, the president of the firm, concluded that “this is not\nthe time for it” (Brett to Klopfer, 15 December 1959).\n\nJohn Clive, whose *Macaulay: The Shaping of a Historian* would be\npublished by Knopf in 1973, suggested a ML selection of Macaulay’s\nworks. Epstein declined the proposal, noting that ML titles had to sell\n“a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 copies a year for a considerable period,\nwhich means that it has to be assigned to undergraduates in fairly\nsubstantial numbers” (Epstein to Clive, 15 September 1959).",

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as\n1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a\nduplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William\nTarg, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May\n1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the *American College\nDictionary* in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By\ndeleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the\ncontent to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the\ndictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the\n*American College Dictionary* by 50 percent would require making much\nsharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a\nGiant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with *The\nConcise Oxford Dictionary*, the Funk and Wagnalls *Desk Standard\nDictionary*, and the *Winston Advanced Dictionary* (School Edition). He\nestimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and\nthat editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott,\n18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans\nto publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. *The* *Modern\nLibrary Dictionary* (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000\nentries.\n\n*The Modern Library Dictionary* was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall\n1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A,\n1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because\nnew business machines acquired by Random House could not handle\nnumber-letter combinations. Copies of *The Modern Library Dictionary*\nthat remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number\n“1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.\n\nThe *First* statement on the verso of the title page appears to have\nbeen removed on all subsequent printings."

(*Spring 1959*)\n\nOriginally published in Britain as *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the\nAuthor* (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from\na new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. *WR* 23 February 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500 copies.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for\nthe ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of\n*The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden* which Random House published in\n1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer\nturned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in\nVintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback\nedition because *Collected Poetry* was selling so well (Klopfer to\nAlfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).\n\nThe ML reprinted *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* because Auden\ndid not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered\nbuying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S.\ncopyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been\nset in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention,\nwhich the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement\nfor works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S.\ncitizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer\nwrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might\ninvalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance”\n(Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set\nof proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of\nuncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the\nPenguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7\nJuly 1958).\n\nAuden included the following note on p. \\[*8*\\] following the table of\ncontents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the\nchronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the\nlast from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony\nor sense or both”.\n\nThe ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson\nreport a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings\nof 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two\nprintings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and\n7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969).\n\n#### 510b.

The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need\n> was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of\n> Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should\n> undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”\n>\n> Four years later *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and\n> Architects* was published in Florence. The time and the man had come\n> together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a\n> great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian\n> Renaissance.\n>\n> Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of\n> the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as\n> the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything\n> considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (*Fall\n> 1959*)\n\nML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London\nby the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959. *WR*\n19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nLinscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He\noriginally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs.\nJonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the\nDeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser\ntranslation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000\nwords.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the\nmanuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s\nworth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates”\n(Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume\nDeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the\nU.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of\npictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable\nmoralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential\nVasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to\nchange the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has\nbeen done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a\nbuilding it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American\nreaders” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).\n\nLinscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he\nthought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to\nCerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and\nan expensive illustrated edition by S & S \\[Simon and Schuster\\] with\ndisgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print.\nInstead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff,\ninaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly\naccurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957)."

ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–302) printed from Little, Brown plates with decorative rules\nremoved from table of contents, fly title and chapter heads in all\nprintings of 516a. Published September 1959. *WR* 28 September 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65.\n\nCerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped *Nine Stories* could be\nincluded in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He\nsubsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint *The* *Catcher in\nthe Rye* (504) and *Nine Stories* in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger\nasked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the\nentry for *The Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the\npresident of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal\nnotice that termination of the *Nine Stories* contract would become\neffective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to\ndispose of any copies on hand.\n\nThe Little, Brown half title (*Nine Stories*) is sandwiched between two\ndecorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “*by*\nJ. D. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The\nML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | *OF THE WORLD’S\nBEST BOOKS* followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line\nstatement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated\nfolder listing each volume in the series.\n\nPrintings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960),\n15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing\nin spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of *Nine Stories* are\nincluded in the entry for *The* *Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504).\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of *Nine\nStories*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when\n*Renaissance Philosophy*, vol. 2*: The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611)\nwas published as ML 301*.*\n\n#### 516b.
