    "Fifty years have passed sinceKimenchanted the world with its insight into Indian life. Since then there have been countless books which described and interpreted that teeming land, but none has supplanted Rudyard Kipling’s radiant picture, with its people of high and low caste, in the hearts of readers, old and young. As a tale of picaresque adventure, as a pageant and as a social document,Kimis a classic in its own field. It is storytelling at its best, with all the vitality and color and appeal it first offered at the turn of the century. (Fall 1950)",

    "Cerf first tried to includeKimin the ML in 1931, perhaps as a replacement for Kipling’sThree Soldiers(3) which had been discontinued several weeks earlier, but Doubleday, Doran was not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17 February 1931). He asked again the following year (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. At that point he appears to have given up. The idea of including a book by Kipling resurfaced in 1949; a week later he decided it should beKim(Cerf to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 9 November 1949 and 15 November 1949). This time Doubleday was willing to grant reprint rights.",
