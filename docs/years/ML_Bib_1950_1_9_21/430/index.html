His analysis of sentiment, his rich imaginative power, his insight into character, particularly feminine character, and his infinitely patient observation of the behavior and relationships of the people in his created world—these are the elements for which he is regarded as thefirstof our novelists. The overwhelming length of his masterpiece,Clarissa—over 2,000 pages in its unabridged form—has frightened away all too many readers. Under the skillful and perceptive editorship of John Angus Burrell of Columbia University, the substance and spirit of this great novel are retained and its prolixities and excesses are trimmed away to make a volume of over 800 lively pages. (Fall 1950)"

He told Burrell: “This provision of size should mean that our condensation will be somewhat longer—and I know it will be better—than any other condensation now in existence” (Cerf to Burrell, 4 November 1949). The published volume exceeded the anticipated length by 200 pages."

Burrell wrote to emphasize that the correct title wasClarissa, or, The History of a Young Lady(Burrell to Cerf and Commins, 23 February 1950). Commins wanted to useClarissa Harloweon the jacket. He argued thatClarissawas not enough to identify the book, that the full title was too long, and that everyone knew it by the incorrect title (Commins, undated memo to Klopfer). In the end the full titleClarissa or The History of a Young Ladywas used on the title page but the running heads record the title as THE HISTORY OF [verso pages] CLARISSA HARLOW [recto pages]. The front panel of jacket A readsClarissa| THE HISTORY OF | CLARISSA HARLOWE, THE FIRST AND | ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS | HEROINES OF THE ENGLISH NOVEL."
