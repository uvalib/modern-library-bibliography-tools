    "Freud’s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through them inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche has opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the world of dreams, Sigmund Freud has created a transformation in our generation’s thinking.The Interpretation of Dreamsis here offered, complete and unabridged, in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who for almost forty years had been the translator and standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America. (Spring 1950)",
    "Brill translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1913. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1950.WR25 March 1950. First printing: 10,000 copies.",
    "The text follows that ofThe Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud(1938: G37), where most of the first chapter ofThe Interpretation of Dreamsis omitted. The Giant includes the following Editor’s Note:",
    "As the first chapter of this work is nothing but an introduction to the book proper, it was deemed best for the purposes of this collection of Freud’s basic writings to omit most of it and to give only those parts that are in any way pertinent to the themes under later consideration. For it is of no particular interest or value to the general reader to know everything held by the ancients and moderns concerning the phenomena of dreams, up to the appearance of the first German edition of this work in 1900. (p. 185)",
    "The Editor’s Note is followed by three paragraphs headed, “The author summarizes these views as follows.” The regular ML edition omits both the Editor’s Note and this heading. The three summary paragraphs of the regular ML edition begin in the middle of p. 5 with no indication that anything has been omitted. In most editions ofThe Interpretation of Dreamsthe first chapter occupies about 95 pages. In the regular ML text it occupies five pages.",
