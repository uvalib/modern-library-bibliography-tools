He says: “I am willing enough to agree with common opinion thatOf Human Bondageis my best work. It is the kind of book that an author can only write once. After all, he has only one life. But the book I like best isCakes and Ale.” The same distinction has been made by countless enthusiastic readers. They considerOf Human BondageMaugham’s masterpiece. But the novel they take to their hearts for its candor and warmth and humor isCakes and Ale."
