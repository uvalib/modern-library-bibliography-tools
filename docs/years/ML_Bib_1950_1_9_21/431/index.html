Jacket:Title in brilliant blue (177) and other lettering in black on coated cream paper with inset multicolor illustration of a young man talking to four young women. Illustration unsigned but probably by Albert de Mee Jousset. Front flap: Louisa May Alcott’s hope thatLittle Womenwould become “the most tattered, dog-eared, best-loved book in the library” has been more than fulfilled through the decades following its publication in 1868. Generation after generation, young people and their elders have read and reread the adventures of the March family, admired Jo’s daring, wept when Beth died and sighed sympathetically over Meg’s and Amy’s romantic adventures. Those who remember their youth and want to renew it keep a special place in their hearts for this nostalgic tale of a vanished time and spirit in American life. (Fall 1950) ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950.WR30 September 1950. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1955. Little Womenwith illustrations by Albert de Mee Jousset was originally scheduled for publication in the Illustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Jousset received $2,000 for the artwork, which included color illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings ranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on pages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly before escalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for bothLittle Womenand Parkman’sOregon Trail, the other Illustrated Modern Library title announced for fall 1947. At this point the type forLittle Womenwas in galleys (the text was set from the edition published in Grosset & Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior Library), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed, and all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publishLittle Womenin the regular ML without color illustrations.The Oregon Trail(423) was also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket ofLittle Womenis unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color illustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library. The ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second printing in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued.",
