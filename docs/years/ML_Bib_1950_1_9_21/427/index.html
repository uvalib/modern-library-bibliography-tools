Front flap: Since 1881, when it was first published,Washington Squarehas had three incarnations. In its original form, it was the novel by which Henry James won world-wide recognition in his early maturity. As a play, under the titleThe Heiress, its glowing story held thousands of theatre-goers under its spell. Finally, as a motion picture, under its new title, the novel once again gave evidence of its vitality and popularity to a new mass audience. NowWashington Squaretakes an honored place in the Modern Library with three other famous works by Henry James:The Turn of the Screw, No. 169,The Wings of the Dove, No. 244, andThe Portrait of a Lady, No. 107. Clifton Fadiman contributes an illuminating and perceptive Introduction for this distinguished addition to the series. (Spring 1950) Originally published by Harper & Bros., 1881.
