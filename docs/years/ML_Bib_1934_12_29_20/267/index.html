    "The selection of a detective story for inclusion in the Modern Library series provided an embarrassment of riches. Yet there was neither hesitation nor reservation in the choice ofThe Maltese Falcon. Its authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (Spring 1934)",
    "Originally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition (pp. [v], [xi]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934.WR31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1949.",
    "Hammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people who served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite a few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your private detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my colleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp. viii–ix).",
    "The Maltese Falconwas originally published as a five-part serial (September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazineBlack Mask. “The book was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two thousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the changes were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to have been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).",
    "There were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and fifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (The Maltese Falcon, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title page verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first in the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been examined.",
    "The ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version starring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period. The 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears to have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued in 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950). The ML remaindered 4,774 copies through the Harlem Book Co in 1952.",
