Signed: Newman. Front flap: The world-wide revival of interest in the works of Charles Dickens makes this completely new edition of his favorite novel an indispensable addition to the Modern Library series. Its publication, simultaneous with the appearance of the recently discoveredThe Life of Our Lord, will be hailed by Dickens enthusiasts and those fortunate readers who are in the enviable position of coming uponDavid Copperfieldfor the first time. This edition contains thirty-nine reproductions from the original illustrations by “Phiz” and is complete in one volume. (Spring 1934) ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1934.WR12 May 1943. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971. Publication was announced for August 1934 and moved forward to May. Norris’sThe Pit(272), originally scheduled for May, was postponed until August. Delays in production ofThe Pitappear to have been primarily responsible for the change, but the earlier publication date ofDavid Copperfieldallowed the ML to benefit from anticipated publicity surrounding the first publication of Dickens’sLife of Our Lord, which was written for his children and published by Simon and Schuster in May 1934. David Copperfieldsold 8,665 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 4,798 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—still in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles, and forty-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series. Thackeray’sVanity Fair(258) outsoldDavid Copperfieldat both periods, butDavid Copperfieldwas Dickens’s most popular title in the ML.The Pickwick Papers(247), with sales of 7,325 copies, was at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in 1942–43 and barely made it into the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52.A Tale of Two Cities(284), with sales of 5,682 copies during 1942‑43, was low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles; it was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML in 1951–52. 269b.
