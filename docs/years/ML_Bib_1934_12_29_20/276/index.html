Inserted slip in some copies facing p. [289]: “This book has been printed from the plates of the Modern Readers’ Series.” Jacket:Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), deep blue (179), moderate green (145) and grayish blue (180) on cream paper with inset illustration of a village set in snow-covered hills; borders in vivid reddish orange, lettering in deep blue. Signed: Newman. Front flap: Maria Chapdelaineis the kind of story on which the usual publisher’s “blurb” would be strangely out of place. The original publishers wisely issued it in a picture wrapper without a single word of description, and let the public discover its beauties for itself. Canadian in setting, this haunting story, written by a French wanderer, has gone far beyond the boundaries of America, and has become one of the treasures of the world’s narrative literature. Did you enjoyGreen Mansions? TryMaria Chapdelaine, then! (Fall 1934) Blake translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1921, with large initials in blue at the beginning of each chapter. Reprinted with drawings by Wilfred Jones, 1924, using the original text plates and a second set of plates containing illustrations and different large initials printed in grayish yellow. Reprinted with introduction and notes by Carl Y. Connor in Macmillan’s Modern Readers’ Series, 1929, with large initials from the illustrated edition added to the text plates to allow for one-color printing and illustrations omitted. ML edition (pp. [xix]–288) printed from Modern   Readers’ Series plates with Connor introduction and notes omitted. Published November 1934.WR1 December 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950. Klopfer offered 8 cents a copy forMaria Chapedelainein 1926 with an advance of $400 against the first 5,000 copies, but Macmillan was planning to include it in their Modern Readers series (Klopfer to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 5 October 1926). In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon Phelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to all of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we could sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell themselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML paid Macmillan a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. The ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used for Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some arrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML edition in that format (David Mason, Fine & Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN; undated.) Maria Chapdelainesold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title. In 1952, two years after the ML edition was discontinued, 3,494 copies were remaindered through the Harlem Book Co. 276b.
