    "It is not without reason thatThe Good Earthhas been the most successful book sinceQuo Vadis, 38 years ago. Its immense popularity can be attributed to the humanity of the people who come to life in its pages and to the Biblical simplicity of its writing. It is a book that takes root deep in the heart of mankind.The Good Earthis more than a mere portrayal of Oriental life; it is the epic of man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world. (Spring 1934)",
    "Originally published by John Day Co., 1931. ML edition (266.1, pp. [1]–[375]) printed from Day plates with battered page numeral “375” removed. Published February 1934.WR10 February 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1970.",
    "The ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major best-seller likeThe Good Earth, which headed the best-seller list for two years (1931–32). Grosset & Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher of hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap between its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint rights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933 about a ML edition ofThe Good Earth, he was told that it would be many months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf to Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January 1933). Arrangements were made later that year forThe Good Earthto appear first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and shortly thereafter in the ML.",
    "Buck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long letter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies to Her Chinese Critic” in theNew York Times Book Review(15 January 1933).",
    "Three months after Pocket Books publishedThe Good Earthas a twenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this book holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many other editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our Modern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative sales figures for the Grosset & Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for the eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following: Grosset & Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH box 141, folder D1).",
    "Sales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War, reflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced interest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",
    "The Good Earthwas shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML published its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.",
    "The ML’s reprint contract forThe Good Earthwas terminated in July 1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies. Together with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML stock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.",

    "The great and lasting popularity ofThe Good Earthcan be attributed to the simple humanity of the people who come to life in its pages. Written in 1930, this novel brought Pearl S. Buck to the admiring attention of the world and was influential, eighteen years later, in earning for her the Nobel Prize for Literature. She was the first and only American woman so to be honored. Author of many books sinceThe Good Earth, Pearl S. Buck is almost always identified with and remembered by this epic of the soil. It is a novel that has taken root and has grown in strength with the passage of the years. Far more than a portrayal of Oriental life,The GoodEarthis the ever-heroic story of man’s struggle for existence in any age and in any part of the world. (Fall 1953)",
    "New bibliographical edition published by Grosset & Dunlap, 1944/45, with a new foreword by the author. ML edition printed from a duplicate set of the plates used for Grosset & Dunlap printings.",
    "An internal RH memo (Regina Spirito to Manny Harper, 5 May 1945) indicates that new plates were being made forThe Good Earthalong with Maugham’sOf Human Bondage(199), Well’sTono-Bungay(225), and Maugham’sMoon and Sixpence(283). It is not known whether the ML made duplicates of the Grosset & Dunlap plates or whether the two sets of plates were made at the same time.",
    "The new typesetting replaces Buck’s introduction with a one-page foreword by Buck dated September 1944. By eliminating running heads and increasing the lines of text on each page from 31 to 37, the new typesetting reduces the length of for Buck’s text by 61 pages.",
    "The ML plates are identical to those used by Grosset & Dunlap with the exception of the title page, the addition of the series title and a publisher’s note to the half title, and the addition of the RH device to the verso of the title page along with the following statement within a single-rule frame: “Random Houseis the publisher of | THE MODERN LIBRARY | bennett a. cerf | donald s. klopfer | robert k. haas | Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway Printing Company  Bound by H. Wolff”."
