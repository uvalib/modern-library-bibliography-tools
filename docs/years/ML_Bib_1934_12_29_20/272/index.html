    "Frank Norris lived to complete only two-thirds of his planned trilogy,The Epic of Wheat.The Pit, which is the second volume, created a national furor and established Norris as the first and one of the greatest realists in America. TodayThe Pitis not only a startling exposé of the machinations of stock gamblers in the fundamental necessity of life, but also an authentic picture of the frenzied struggle for power that marked the end of American pioneer days and the beginnings of its ventures in world markets. (Fall 1934)",
    "Originally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1903. New bibliographical edition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML edition (pp. [v]–403) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934.WR25 August 1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 31 December 1940.",
    "Robert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary, was inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris inSaturday Review of Literature(27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML edition of Norris’sMcTeagueorTheOctopusthree years earlier (Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff sent copies ofThe PitandMcTeaguefor his consideration. He noted thatThe Pithad sold 189,455 copies in all editions whileMcTeaguehad sold 67,272 copies andThe Octopushad sold 59,779 copies (de Graff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided thatThe Pit“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July 1933). He appears to have been unaware thatMcTeague(57) was in the ML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni & Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.",
    "The plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition ofThe Pitwere too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would have to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would share the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think, making some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.). Meanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original plates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the Modern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios in small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty bad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you think, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent looking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing Co., 29 August 1933).",
    "Publication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed until August; Dickens’sDavid Copperfield(269), originally scheduled for August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production ofThe Pitappears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end of April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to use” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was made to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928 Argonaut edition.The Pitappears to have been the first ML title printed by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but it would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and make new letterpress plates.",
    "Sales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing.The Pitwas discontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first ML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper.",
