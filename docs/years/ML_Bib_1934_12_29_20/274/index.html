To my mind the protest against false values contained in this book, is one of the landmarks in the life of reason.”  —MAX EASTMAN. (Fall 1934)",

    "The influence of Thorstein Veblen’sThe Theory of the Leisure Classhas grown immeasurably in the half century since its original publication. Some of its phrases—notably “conspicuous consumption”—have become standard in our national vocabulary. His examination of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on pecuniary culture is one of the masterly analyses and critiques of our socio-economic development. Its irony, its rich accumulation of evidence and, above all, its boldness of interpretation have kept it a vital work through years of social upheaval, economic disequilibrium and an altogether unstable period of national and world history.

    "Since its original publicationThe Theory of the Leisure Classhas become a classic in its field, both for its economic analysis and for its perspective on social values in America.",

Veblen’s examination of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on pecuniary culture is one of the masterly critiques of our socio-economic development. The new point of view and method elaborated by Veblen riddled the whole structure of economics as a pseudo-social science and created instead an entirely original set of economic categories, based on changing industrial conditions rather than an inflexible system formulated from so-called eternal principles.",
