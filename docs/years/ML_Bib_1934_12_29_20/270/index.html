    "Twenty-four centuries have witnessed the fulfillment of Thucydides’ intention to make his work “a possession for ever, not the rhetorical triumph of an hour.” Not only to students of history and statecraft, but to enlightened readers of every shade of interest,The Peloponnesian Warprovides an exact, eye-witness account of the waning glory of Periclean Greece as a key to the present and a prophecy of the future. The unabridged Crawley translation captures all the vigor and penetration of “the first and greatest critical historian.” (Spring 1934)",
