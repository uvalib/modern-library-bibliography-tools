    "By now the fretful babblings of the prurient over the amatory excursions of Messire Jurgen have subsided. Instead of bothering to discover phallic parables in every casual allusion, adult readers take the keenest delight in the nimble satire of this morality in behalf of monogamy and common-sense.Jurgen, thanks to the obscenity seekers, has become Cabell’s best-known novel. (Spring 1934)",
    "Originally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1919. ML edition (pp. [iii–iv], [xiii]–368) printed from McBride plates with the expanded foreword first included in the eighth McBride printing. Published July 1934.WR28 July 1934. Discontinued fall 1943.",
    "Jurgenwas one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure after they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a $5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice he offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’sCream of the JestorThe Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck(Cerf to Mr. [Guy] Holt, McBride, 29 July 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition ofBeyond Life(104) two years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint editions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained strong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition of Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).",
    "McBride authorized a ML edition ofThe Cream of the Jest(131) in 1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer forJurgen, but the response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12 cents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to permit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least for the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and particularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so profitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way – this despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the sale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer to Rose, 27 March 1928).",
    "Grosset & Dunlap published a reprint edition ofJurgenin its Novels of Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in publishingJurgenin the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker, McBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed when the Grosset & Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months later, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we can get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset & Dunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset & Dunlap wrote McBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t directly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset & Dunlap to McBride & Co., 16 November 1933).",
