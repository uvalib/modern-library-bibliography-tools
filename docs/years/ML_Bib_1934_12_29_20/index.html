The printing surface is raised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal, Linotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which is cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface is inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates cast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the nineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than one printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of standing type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was a metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each page allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways, depending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or thirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early 1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was likely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus saving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher anticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The ML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings. All ML books were printed from plates."

A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is based on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a lithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink; non-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink. Offset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to be printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a previously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed from metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of letterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed sheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the number of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives are placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The plate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts differently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the printing and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing possible” (Marshall Lee,"

Modern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates for each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant printing methodology, some printers appear to have stored the lithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates were stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic printing were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book-printing industry” (p. 136)."
