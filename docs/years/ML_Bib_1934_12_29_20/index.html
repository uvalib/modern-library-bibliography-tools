The book appeared under the Random House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The Modern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of the firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back copies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and Company, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate Sylvia Beach.Ulysseswas officially banned in the United States and tourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at customs."

The case was heard in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and attorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random House. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized the literary stature ofUlyssesand concluded that “nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into the United States was overturned."

          "#text": "All ML books before 1934 appear to have been printed from letterpress plates. Letterpress is a relief technology. The printing surface is raised from the body of individual types cast from molten metal, Linotype slugs cast for an entire line, or metal plates, each of which is cast from a page of composed metal type. The raised printing surface is inked, and ink is transferred to paper in the press. Relief plates cast from pages of standing type began to be widely used in the nineteenth century. Plates were ideal for books that required more than one printing since printers normally could not afford to store pages of standing type against the possibility of subsequent printings. There was a metal plate for each page of a book. Having separate plates for each page allowed the plates to be imposed on the press in different ways, depending on whether a book was being printed with eight, sixteen, or thirty-two pages on each side of the sheet. Most books before the early 1960s were printed letterpress. Books for which a single printing was likely to satisfy demand were usually printed from standing type, thus saving the cost of making plates. Only those for which the publisher anticipated multiple printings were printed from letterpress plates. The ML’s economic model was based on an assumption of multiple printings. All ML books were printed from plates."
        },
        {
          "#text": "When the ML reprinted copyrighted works it tried whenever possible to use the original publisher’s letterpress plates or duplicates of the original plates. The original plates were usually designed for a full-sized trade edition, not the ML’s compact format. This explains why many ML books printed from the original publisher’s plates had uncomfortably narrow margins. In some cases the only way the ML could print from the original publisher’s plates was to cut off the running heads, as it did with Anatole France’sRevolt of the Angels(163). The introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 enhanced the appearance of ML books and made it easier to print from original publishers’ plates."

        {
          "#text": "Offset lithography is a planographic technology where the printing area of a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed into the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and etching). A lithographic plate is smooth to the touch. Lithography is based on the antipathy of oil and water. Printing areas of a lithographic plate are treated to accept greasy printer’s ink; non-printing areas are coated with a thin film of water that repels ink. Offset lithography begins with photographic negatives of the content to be printed on each page. The images can be photographed from a previously published book, photographed from reproduction proofs printed from metal type, or composed directly from photographic images of letterforms and other content. The negatives for one side of a printed sheet are imposed in the same way as relief plates, depending on the number of pages to be printed on each side of the sheet. The negatives are placed against a photosensitized plate and exposed to light. “The plate is then treated with chemicals that affect the exposed parts differently from the rest. This results in a distinction between the printing and nonprinting parts of the plate that makes printing possible” (Marshall Lee,Bookmaking, 2d ed., 1979, p. 132). Letterpress printing typically involves a separate plate for each page; offset plates typically print an entire side of a sheet at a time. Modern practice involves storing the negatives and burning new plates for each printing; before offset lithography became the dominant printing methodology, some printers appear to have stored the lithographic plates for reuse in the same way that letterpress plates were stored. Lee notes that the basic techniques of lithographic printing were developed early in the twentieth century “but it was not until the 1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method, and it was not until after World War II that it became a major book-printing industry” (p. 136)."
        },
        {
          "#text": "Unlike relief plates, lithographic plates are lightweight and flexible. They are attached to one cylinder of the printing press. The plate is treated so that the printing areas accept greasy printer’s ink and repel water. In the press, the plate is coated with a thin film of water, which prevents ink from adhering to non-printing areas; another roller applies printer’s ink which adheres to the images to be printed."
        },
        {
          "#text": "Lithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or “offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed directly to paper. The inked image is “offset” to a second cylinder covered with a rubber blanket which in turn transfers the image to paper carried by a third cylinder. Lee indicates inBookmaking: The Illustrated Guide to Design/Production/Editing(2nd ed., 1979), “Several advantages are gained by printing on a rubber blanket first instead of directly on paper: (a) the plates last longer, (b) less water comes in contact with the paper, (c) the resilient rubber cylinder permits printing finer copy on rougher paper, and (d) the speed is increased” (p. 137)."
        },
        {
          "#text": "Since letterpress printing transfers ink directly from relief plates or standing type to paper, the type surface is wrong reading so that the printed image will be right reading. The extra step in offset lithography means that lithographic plates are right reading and can be read in the same way that a printed page is read. The inked image on the offset cylinder is wrong reading, and the image transferred to paper is right reading."
        },
        {
          "#text": "The ML occasionally resorted to offset lithography before the 1960s when the original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the ML’s format. At that period offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing and the quality was considered to be inferior, but it allowed the ML to avoid the cost of a new typesetting. The ML could photograph the pages of a printed book, reduce the dimensions of the type page photographically, and make offset plates from the negatives."
        },
        {
          "#text": "The first ML book printed by offset lithography appears to have been Frank Norris’sThe Pit(272), published in August 1934. Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular printers, did not have an offset department before 1955, and the ML had the book printed by Polygraphic Printing Co. of America, a New York shop that specialized in offset lithography. Other ML titles printed from offset lithographic plates before the mid-1960s include Newton,Amenities of Book Collecting(1935: 287), Malraux,Man’s Fate(1936: 294), Whitman,Leaves of Grass(1940: G48), Bemelmans,My War with the United States(1941: 343), and Thurber,The Thurber Carnival(1957: 496). The introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939 allowed later printings ofMan’s Fateto be made from the original publisher’s letterpress plates.Man’s Fatewas the only ML title printed in succession from offset plates, letterpress plates, and then again from offset plates when the ML switched to offset lithographic printing for most of its titles in the mid 1960s."
        },
        {
          "#text": "The cost of printing by offset lithography dropped below that of letterpress printing around 1963. Over the next few years the ML converted most of its books to offset. Today nearly all commercially published books are printed by offset lithography, and letterpress printing is largely confined to small presses that print books in limited editions from handset type."
        },
        {
          "#text": "Several ML books published in the “reissue” format in the 1980s reverted to letterpress printing, presumably to capture price breaks for using idle letterpress equipment after most book publishers had switched to offset lithography. Some of these were printed from letterpress plates that were worn and battered from decades of use; the appearance of these books is distinctly inferior to those printed from offset plates. When the ML switched to offset printing in the mid-1960s, it tried to photograph first ML printings or the earliest printings it could find in order to avoid worn type."

Two books on Judaism compiled for Random House,The Wisdom of Israel, edited by Lewis Browne (1945) andGreat Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People, edited by Leo W.

Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when he was in Boston in September. “My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin have a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are trying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like ourselves” (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934)."

Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML edition of Norris’sMcTeagueorTheOctopusthree years earlier (Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930).

He noted thatThe Pithad sold 189,455 copies in all editions whileMcTeaguehad sold 67,272 copies andThe Octopushad sold 59,779 copies (de Graff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided thatThe Pit“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July 1933). He appears to have been unaware thatMcTeague(57) was in the ML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni & Liveright as a vice-president in 1923."

Meanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original plates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the Modern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios in small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty bad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you think, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent looking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing Co., 29 August 1933)."

In the end a decision was made to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928 Argonaut edition.The Pitappears to have been the first ML title printed by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but it would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and make new letterpress plates."

Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted to publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald $50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934).

He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future printings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like the preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and incoherance [sic], two qualities which the story that succeeds it manages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to reassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to Fitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared, “The prefaceisincoherent.
