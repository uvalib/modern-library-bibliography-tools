    "The Enormous Roomis a book of immense proportions. Only in a narrow sense is it an indictment of war. The filth and the futility of war are pitilessly revealed, but even more is it a revelation of the debasement and glory of youth. Written with a fiery imagination and the keenest sensitiveness, it is none the less a book of the most spontaneous realism, and as such holds through the years a place by itself among the few important books produced by the World War. (Fall 1933)",
    "Originally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published January 1934.WR27 January 1934. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.",
    "Cerf rejectedThe Enormous Roomwhen Cummings’s agent suggested a ML edition in 1928: “I never considered E. E. Cumming’s [sic] ‘Enormous Room’ because, in my opinion, it is one of the most over-rated books of our time” (Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, to Cerf, 18 April 1928; Cerf to Baumgarten, 21 April 1928). He later changed his mind.",
    "Cummings’s bibliographer wrote in 1960: “Cummings’ ‘Introduction’, his father’s ‘Foreword’ and the restoration, under the direct supervision of the author, of the original manuscript text makes the ‘Modern Library’ edition . . . the most authoritative edition issued to date” (Firmage, p. 5).",
    "The Enormous Roomsold 2,749 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.",

    "Among the few important novels which have survived since the end of World War One,The Enormous Roomstill holds a distinguished place in American fiction. Although it reveals the filth and futility of war pitilessly, it is not essentially a war novel; it is, rather, an affirmation of the aspirations and an interpretation of the thwartings of young men confronted by the fierce reality of battle, the taut periods of preparation for conflict and the grim aftermath of trial by fire. Written with imagination and sensibility,The Enormous Roomis a novel spontaneous in realism and rewarding in insights into the enduring spirit of youth. (Spring 1955)",
