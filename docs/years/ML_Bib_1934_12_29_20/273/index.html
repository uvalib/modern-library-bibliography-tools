Signed: Newman. Front flap: The Great Gatsbyis a story of the fabulous 1920s, that incredible period in American history that ended in a crash from which we are all reeling still. The editors ofTimeMagazine report that Gatsby was the “first racketeer in United States fiction.” Countless novels and motion pictures have followed the pattern since, butThe Great Gatsbyremains the most brilliant and understanding portrait of the first mad days of the bootleg era. It is by all odds Scott Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the development of American literature can afford to overlook. (Fall 1934) Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.WR29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939. Maxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML edition ofThe Great Gatsby. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to announce the forthcoming publication ofTender Is the Night, which appeared initially as a serial inScribner’s Magazine, and added: “If it goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why don’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by Gertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter ofThe Great Gatsbyand wrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it had brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was “creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see Tanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted to publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald $50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934). Including his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300 from the ML edition. Fitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our series” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf about the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off writing it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of the approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week. He appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs of the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the corrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the introduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32). The ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original introductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni & Liveright era, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction toSouth Wind(114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition ofMrs. Dalloway(168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of this genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction toThe Great Gatsbywas one of the worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future printings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like the preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and incoherance [sic], two qualities which the story that succeeds it manages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to reassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to Fitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared, “The prefaceisincoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but simply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934). A 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is inscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in Tryon [North Carolina]” with the additional annotation at the top of p. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington, London; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the ML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of Maxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s own hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv <modlib@thuban.owu.edu>, 10 November 2011). Tender Is the Night, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published in April 1934, five months before the ML edition ofThe Great Gatsby. By 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent Cerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition ofTender Is the Nightif he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now are essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the correspondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the preceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he wrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity . . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than one in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads them to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell Perkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishingThis Side of Paradise,The Great Gatsby, andTender Is the Nightas an omnibus volume in the ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli,Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439). Sales ofThe Great Gatsbywere disappointing. The ML edition sold about 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal enthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest sellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott Fitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, 31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By the early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition ofThe Great Gatsbywas selling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39). There was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 afterThe Great Gatsbywas discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are stamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as remainders. .",
