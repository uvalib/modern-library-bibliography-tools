Front flap: The swarming Negro life of Catfish Row in Old Charleston provided Du Bose Heyward with the material for what first became a distinguished American novel, then a highly successful play under the aegis of the Theatre Guild, and now in its final incarnation, simultaneous with its admission to the Modern Library, a truly indigenous opera by the gifted composer, George Gershwin.Porgyis steeped in the atmosphere of one of the few really individual cities left in the United States. Heywood Broun calls it “the most moving and admirable book about Southern Negroes that I have ever read.” (Fall 1934) Originally published by George H. Doran Co., 1925. ML edition (pp. [5]–196) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates, including the decorative line drawings by Theodore Nadejen. Published October 1934.WR10 November 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941. The inclusion ofPorgyin the ML was inspired by the forthcoming production of Gershwin’sPorgy and Bess. ThePWadvertisement announcing the ML’s fall 1934 list stated, “The Theatre Guild production of ‘Porgy’ this Fall, with George Gershwin music, will center new attention on this book” (PW, 11 August 1934, p. 407). The Theatre Guild had hoped thatPorgy and Besswould be ready for the fall 1934 season (Alpert, p. 78), but the premier was delayed until October 1935, a full year after the appearance of the ML edition."
