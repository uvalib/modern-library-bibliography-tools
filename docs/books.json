The systematic statement of his position which he\n> aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died\n> before the book was half done.\n>\n> The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view\n> of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his\n> own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to\n> that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to\n> complete his work.

His writings have had an influence that has\n> reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the\n> social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence\n> of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always\n> the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and\n> forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His\n> is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (*Fall\n> 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published December 1925. *WR* 19 December 1925.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nKallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on\n*The Philosophy of William James*. His royalties during the first six\nmonths of 1926 totaled $179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions\nfees to James’s original publishers. A few days after *The Philosophy of\nWilliam James* was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar\nvolume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined.\nThe ML published *Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell* (147) in October\n1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial\nwork appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926\nKallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was\ninterested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the\nproject three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which\npublished most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary\npermissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection,\n*The Philosophy of Santayana*, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942\n(see 355).\n\nSales of *The Philosophy of William James* during the first six months\nof 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period\nMay 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.\n\n#### 119b.

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1969/70. Reissued 1978.\n\nMacaulay had agreed to write an introduction to *Wuthering Heights* when\nthe ML was published by B&L. The ML edition was announced for May 1925\n(B&L advertisement, *PW*, 14 March 1925, p. 847), but the introduction\nfailed to arrive and publication was postponed. Cerf, who had just\nbought the ML from Liveright, hoped to call on Macaulay when he visited\nEngland in June but was unable to see her. Shortly after his return he\nwrote, “Do you remember telling Horace Liveright that you would write a\nshort introduction for the Modern Library edition of Emily Bronte’s\n“Wuthering Heights”? We want to publish this volume in November, and I\nwould therefore appreciate very much indeed, receiving this introduction\nwithin a month.” He indicated that it did not have to be longer than\nfour or five pages and added, “. . .  the usual stupendous honorarium of\n$50 will be sent you immediately on its receipt” (Cerf to Macaulay, 6\nAugust 1925). Macaulay sent the introduction on 23 August 1925. After\nthanking her he added: “I do hope before long we may have one of your\nown books in the series. I think that TOLD BY AN IDIOT would make an\nideal addition to the Modern Library” (Cerf to Macaulay 10 September\n1925).\n\nA slightly abridged version of Macaulay’s introduction was also included\nin the British edition of *Wuthering Heights* published in 1926 in\nJonathan Cape’s Travellers’ Library. In the ML edition the first\nparagraph of the introduction concludes with the following three\nsentences:\n\n> There must be, there must always have been, something magnetic about\n> these Irish Yorkshire parson’s daughters. One result of this is that\n> every available fact about their personalities and lives is now\n> familiar knowledge, together with some things that are not facts at\n> all, such as the theory which attributes “Wuthering Heights” to the\n> poor ineffectual dipsomaniac brother, Bramwell Brontë, who boasted to\n> his friends that it was his work, but who, so far as has transpired,\n> never wrote a good line of verse or prose in his life. It is supposed\n> the only connection he had with “Wuthering Heights” was that Emily put\n> some of his love-sick raving into the mouth of her Heathcliff.\n\nIn the Traveller’s Library introduction the paragraph ends with the\nwords, “. . . every available fact about their personalities and lives\nis now familiar knowledge, together with some things which are not facts\nat all.”\n\nExcept for the preliminaries, ML and Travellers’ Library printings are\nprinted from identical plates. The only difference is that the\nTravellers’ Library plates have signature numbers at the foot of the\nfirst page of each gathering. The typography is typical of other\nTravellers’ Library volumes, so the ML appears to have acquired a\nduplicate set of Travellers’ Library plates. The cooperative arrangement\nmay have been worked out when Cerf was in London in the summer of 1925.\n\nThe title-page misspellings of Brontë (“Bronte”) and Macaulay\n(“Macauley”) were corrected in the second printing.\n\nBlue Ribbon Books used the ML plates, including the Macaulay\nintroduction, for a 1939 printing of *Wuthering Heights* in its new\nreprint series Triangle Books. Books in the series were clothbound and\nsold for 39 cents a copy.\n\nSales of *Wuthering Heights* during the first six months of 1928 placed\nit 72nd out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it was solidly in the first quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales. The regular ML edition slipped below the first quarter\nduring the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. This probably\nreflects a loss of sales in the academic market following the inclusion\nof *Wuthering Heights* as one of the first titles in Modern Library\nCollege Editions, a paperbound series launched in 1950 specifically for\nclassroom use.\n\n#### 120.1b.

ML edition (pp. xxvii‑xxxii, \\[1\\]–400) printed from plates\noriginally made for the Illustrated Modern Library with pagination of\nthe Editor’s Preface revised. In ML and MLCE printings Charlotte\nBrontë’s Biographical Notice is reset in smaller type to match that of\nGettman’s introduction. ML and MLCE printings include Eichenberg’s\nwood-engraved chapter heads that were made for the Book-of-the-Month\nClub and the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 18) but not the full-page\nwood engravings.\n\nThe Illustrated Modern Library edition of *Wuthering Heights* (IML 18),\npublished in November 1946, was printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. The 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club edition of *Wuthering\nHeights* had a wood-engraved chapter heading for the first chapter only.\nFor the Illustrated Modern Library edition Eichenberg made 20 additional\nwood engravings for the chapter heads. Since *Wuthering Heights*\nconsists of 34 chapters, several of the wood engravings were used twice\nand one (pp. 38, 141, 248) is used three times.\n\nNew plates made for the Illustrated Modern Library were usually used for\nsubsequent printings of the regular ML edition. This appears to have\nbeen the intention, since the preliminaries for the regular ML edition\nof *Wuthering Heights*, including Macaulay’s introduction, were reset to\nmatch the rest of the text. However, the original plates were used when\nthe regular ML edition of *Wuthering Heights* (120.1c) was reprinted in\nfall 1947. No regular ML printings with the reset text have been seen\nprior to 120.2a, when the Illustrated Modern Library plates were used\nwith a new introduction by Royal A.

He is a dreamy, rather\n> stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical\n> tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made\n> \\[*sic*\\] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s”\n> love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a\n> wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as\n> the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of\n> our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic\n> majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and\n> develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is\n> fulfilled. (*Fall 1925)*\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap: <br>\n> As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a\n> supreme position among American novelists. *Poor White*, like\n> *Winesburg, Ohio* (No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately\n> upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary\n> writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making\n> men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly\n> from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the\n> naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world\n> celebrated. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking\nPress, August 1925. ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–371) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings.\nPublished February 1926. *WR* 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued fall 1939.\n\nWhen Anderson became a B&L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed\ninterest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including\n*Poor White* in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April\n1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s\ncontract with B&L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately\nendeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in\nwriting, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library”\n(contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML\nbefore *Poor White* could be added to the series. It is not known\nwhether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or\nafter the sale.\n\nFor writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML\nbooks instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925).\nHe wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to\nbe published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to\ncall on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long\nrows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little\nlike a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city”\n(ML ed., p. vi).\n\nThe dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was\ndivorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request\n(Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication\nwas inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).\n\nSales of *Poor White* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th\nout of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies\nby April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000\ncopies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nAnderson, *Winesburg, Ohio* (1921–1973) 96"

Other of\n> his novels in the Modern Library series are “The Flame of Life”,\n> (volume number 65), “The Child of Pleasure”, (volume number 98), and\n> “The Triumph of Death”, (volume number 112). (*Spring 1926*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Richmond & Son, 1898, and\nsubsequently by L. C. Page & Co., 1902. ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–296)\nprinted from Richmond/Page plates. Publication announced for May 1926.\n*WR* 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1928.\n\nLewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so\naggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you,\nit appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that\nare absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the\nprivilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being,\nat least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list,\nalthough some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder\nor The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box\n128, L. C. Page & Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm\ncommitment on Liveright’s part to include both *The Maidens of the\nRocks* and *The Intruder* in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the\nseries he demanded that they pay advances of $240 against royalties of 8\ncents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him\n$480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other\nthe following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10\nSeptember 1925).\n\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the\nbeginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year.\nPage responded with a pitch for *The Intruder*, noting that it was part\nof the trilogy that included *The Child of Pleasure* and *The Flame of\nLife* and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough\nstory, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers\nof the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind\nany of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always\nrun neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to\nthe two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He\nconcluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the\nother three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want\nchildren’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page\nto Cerf, 7 February 1927).\n\nCerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The\nIntruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the\nadvance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong\nfeeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library\nwith a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nD’Annunzio, *Flame of Life* (1918–1936) 62<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Triumph of Death* (1923–1931) 102<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Child of Pleasure* (1925–1931) 113"

Later that year Random House\npublished a one-volume trade edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting; the MLG edition (G65) printed from RH plates appeared in\n1944.

(*Spring* <u>(</u>*1939*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published\nJune 1926. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1976/77.\n\nMelville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The\nLibrary of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s,\npublished in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to\nnineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank.\nEmerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf\nWhittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range\nPS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of\nnine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in\n1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea\nromances like *Typee* and *Omoo*. *Moby-Dick* sold poorly when it was\npublished in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.\n\nThe critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the\npublication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, *Herman Melville: Mariner and\nMystic* (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of\n*Billy Budd*, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver\nedited the manuscript and published it in *Billy Budd and Other Prose\nPieces* (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years\nlater in *Shorter Novels of Herman Melville* (Horace Liveright, 1928).\n\nWeaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His\nbiography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated\nwith a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published\nautobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia\nUniversity’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course\nin Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this\nman had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . .\nand discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and\na wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 17–18).\n\nWeaver wrote introductions to two editions of *Moby-Dick* that were\npublished as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way.\nHis introduction to the edition published by Albert & Charles Boni in\n1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the\nfollowing year for the ML.\n\nThe ML may have tried to position its edition of *Moby-Dick* to appeal\nboth to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated\nthe darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from\nMasefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful\nromance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic,\nall the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s\nintroduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the\nmalice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of\nleperous \\[*sic*\\] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).\n\nSales of *Moby Dick* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th\nout of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943\nit was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of *Moby\nDick* from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand\nfollowing American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven\nprintings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of\n2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling\n23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).\n\nCerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of *Moby Dick*\nunder the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar\n“specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton\nHouse titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a\ndeparture from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality\npaper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and\nwere sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed\n500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department\nstores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do\nwell with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated\nthat they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nThe ML also published *Moby Dick* (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series,\nusing plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.\n\nAll ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the\nspelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead\nof the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of\nthe work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of\nAmerica edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions\nthat omit it.\n\nThe Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new\ntypesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth\nHardwick, is inconsistent. The title is *Moby-Dick or, The Whale*, but\nthe biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as *Moby\nDick*, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated\nform when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form\nwhen referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983),\nwhich includes *Redburn* and *White-Jacket* as well as *Moby-Dick*, uses\nthe hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages\n(pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record\nchapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen,\nwith the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp.\n985–991) are MOBY DICK.\n\n#### 124b.

(*Not seen*)\n\nThe Harper plates used for ML printings through 1928 had become badly\nworn and Klopfer decided that the ML could not make another printing\nfrom them. He asked Harper’s for their “other set \\[of plates\\] so we\ncan do a decent looking job” (Klopfer to Harper & Bros., 16 May 1929).\nHarper’s promised that a new set of electros would be ready by 21 June\n(Harper & Bros. to Klopfer, 13 June 1929). The ML went to press later\nthat month with a new printing of 4,000 copies.\n\nThere are minor differences between the two sets of plates in addition\nto the pagination of the preliminaries. The plates used for 126a–b\ninclude signatures, though 126a–b are not printed as signed. The plates\nused for 126c–d do not have signatures. On p. 146, line 5, “lost their\ncharm” appears correctly in 126a–b and incorrectly as “lost there charm”\nin 126c–d. On p. 201, lines 24–25, the sentence “Now I’ll wish you good\nmorning” is broken at the end of line 24 after “you” in 126a–b and after\n“good” in 126c–d. There are probably other differences as well. When a\nreader in 1931 called the ML’s attention to the error on p. 146, the ML\ninformed Harper’s but the plates were not corrected.\n\n#### 126d.

The ML then\napproached Donald Davidson of Vanderbilt University, who initially\ndeclined because of other commitments. The ML extended the deadline, and\nDavidson accepted the assignment. He submitted his introduction in\nspring 1951 and received the ML’s $150 fee. However, *The Return of the\nNative* never appeared in MLCE, perhaps because of the competing\nRinehart edition.

(*Fall 1926*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.\n*WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1940.\n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th\nout of 147 ML titles.\n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New\nYork, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an\nintroduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like\nto have your name among the people who have written introductions to our\nvolumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had\nnot liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a\nML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).\nIn the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.\n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He\ninformed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral\nand literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not\ntoo extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book\nin such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to\nKlopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his\nmarriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He\nremoved a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote\nothers. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his\nfourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for $125, Lewisohn wrote:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and\n> I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in\n> Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows\n> Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the\n> dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension\n> points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML\n> texts).\n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\n> and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was\n> sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be\n> less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions\n> within me. . . .\n>\n> We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I\n> think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I\n> tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her\n> family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to\n> be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was\n> perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was\n> absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor\n> true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a\n> middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older\n> than her oldest child.

She specifically objected to the passage:\n“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\nand her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked\nLewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for\nincluding the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful\nnuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will\nall have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very\nearliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).\n\n#### 128b<sub>1</sub>.

The jacket\nstatement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the\nintroduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer\nincluded.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative\n> life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. *Up Stream*\n> is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,\n> outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest\n> and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.\n> In the literature of America’s coming of age, *Up Stream* occupies a\n> unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final\n> declaration of creative independence. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nThe fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the\nML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.\nLewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised *Up\nStream* for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after\nthose that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to\nLudwig Lewisohn in 1936 that *Up Stream* continued to sell at the rate\nof 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time\nthat the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying\nrecord” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).\n\nThree other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. *A Modern Book of\nCriticism* (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published\nin spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. *The Story of\nAmerican Literature* (G43), originally published as *Expression in\nAmerica*, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to\nlobby for the inclusion of his novel *The Island Within* shortly after\nthe Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the\nseries were “more than enough” but suggested that *Up Stream* might be\ndropped and *The Island Within* published in its place. Lewisohn\napproved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass\nCanfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939). *The Island Within* (329)\nsold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewisohn, ed., *A Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75\n\nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43\n\nLewisohn, *The Island Within* (1940–1942) 329"

Published spring 1969 at $2.45.\n\nThe statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text\n. . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the\ncorrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate\ndialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition\npublished by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American\nedition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American\nprintings before 1967—used quotation marks.\n\nPrintings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½\ninch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in\n1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼\ninch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the\ntaller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely\nredesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼\ninch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch\nformat. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings.\nThe ISBN [394-6012](callto:+1394-6012)4-6 (without the initial 0) was\nadded to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets\nfor previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is\nprobably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain\nendpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were\ncharacteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the\nremainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front\nendpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as\nthe 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to\nunderstand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to\nthe 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger\nformat.\n\nThere appears to have been a gap of several years between the\ndiscontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.\n\n#### 129.2b.

Outwardly, Kennaston is a discreet and\n> reputable man—a convinced monogamist, a dutiful householder, a docile\n> Presbyterian. But within him there dwells an adventurer who ranges the\n> whole of the visible universe, and a lover who has found his heart’s\n> desire. Upon the framework of this story Mr. Cabell hangs the loot of\n> much intellectual marauding—brilliant bits of irony, penetrating\n> reflections upon faiths and ideas, a whole agnostic philosophy. It\n> would be difficult to match this book in American fiction . . . A\n> thing obviously written *con amore* joyously without regard to\n> markets. The reader it will attract is precisely the reader most worth\n> attracting. It is not a popular novel, not a story, not a mere\n> time-killer: it is a piece of literature.” —*H.* *L. Mencken*.\n> (*Spring 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s\n> mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the\n> illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane\n> philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the\n> enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix\n> Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the\n> allegory of *The Cream of the Jest* we discover something of what is\n> in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1917; new\nbibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with\nintroduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions”\n(Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. \\[v\\]–250), including\nWard’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride\ntypesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML\nprintings. Publication announced for January 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927.\nFirst printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Cream of the Jest* as early as July\n1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s\n*Jurgen* for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing\na “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not\nwant to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an\nedition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition\nnever appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the\nJest* the following year. *Jurgen* (271) was not included in the ML\nuntil 1934.\n\nThe first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title\nannounced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of\nthe eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print\nrun. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state\n“*Eighth Printing* | *First Modern Library Edition* | *1927*”.) This\nmight explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first\nML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131\nvariant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s\nspring lists usually weren’t available as early as November.\n\nIn addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives\n(which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in\nAugust 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930,\nand printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937,\nfor a total of at least 25,000 copies.\n\nSales of *The Cream of the Jest* during the first six months of 1928\nplaced it 33rd out of 147 ML titles.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nCabell, *Beyond Life* (1923–1935) 104<br>\nCabell, *Jurgen* (1934–1943) 271<br>"

Discontinued 1 January 1937 after the\nfour Nietzsche volumes in the regular ML were repackaged as *The\nPhilosophy of Nietzsche* (G32).\n\nAfter discussing a ML edition of Nietzsche’s *Dawn of Day* with\nMacmillan, Cerf and Klopfer decided they wanted *Ecce Homo* instead.\nThey hoped to use the translation that Macmillan imported from England\nand offered an advance of $200 against royalties of 4 cents a copy. They\nasked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance\nthat Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive\nreprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr.,\nMacmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent\nfirm in London but the response was slow in coming.\n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their\nown translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of\nColumbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended\nHorace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss\nindicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer\nthan they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of\nhis graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of\n*Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6\nDecember.\n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in\nmid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with\nFadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October\n1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but\nin time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition\nof *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* was the first time Fadiman’s name\nwas attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 22 May 1943, p.\n37).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (1917–) 9<br>\nNietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* (1917–1936) 28<br>\nNietzsche, *Genealogy of Morals* (1918–1936) 59<br>\nNietzsche, *Philosophy* (Giant, 1937–1970) G32<br>\nNietzsche, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1968–) G113<br>"

He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy\ndepartment at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He\nreceived his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.\n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on\nRatner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on\nBiblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract\non Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I\nbelieve the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the\nexcessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6\nOctober 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza\ncontinues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7\nJune 1927).\n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,\nRatner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s\n*Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for $500. He also retained the\nunearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the\nprevious year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.\nThe two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner\nreceived no further royalties.

(*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published in London by Martin Secker, 1922. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting with the poets arranged\nchronologically instead of alphabetically, the addition of ten poems by\nAiken, a few other additions and deletions, and minor revisions in\nAiken’s preface. Published February 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nCerf offered Aiken royalties of 8 cents a copy for *Modern American\nPoets* and indicated that the ML was prepared to spend up to $700 for\npermissions. He anticipated sales of close to 5,000 copies a year. He\nurged Aiken to include his own poetry, which had been omitted from the\nSecker edition, and noted that he wouldn’t care if William Carlos\nWilliams and Arturo Giovannitti were omitted (Cerf to Aiken, 12 March\n1926). Aiken agreed to omit Giovannitti, who was represented by a single\npoem in the Secker edition, but not Williams; however, the number of\nWilliams’s poems was reduced from seven to one. Other revisions\nconsisted of the addition of Amy Lowell’s “The City of Falling Leaves,”\nbringing the number of her poems to seven, and the substitution of T. S.\nEliot’s “Gerontion” and “The Hollow Men” for “Rhapsody on a Windy\nNight,” increasing the number of his poems from five to six.\n\nAiken expressed interest in including Ezra Pound but wasn’t sure that\npermissions could be secured (Aiken to Cerf, 6 April 1926). In the\npreface to the Secker edition he stated: “I regret extremely that I have\nbeen unable to secure the permissions of Mr Edgar Lee Masters and Mr\nEzra Pound for a selection from their work: both of them obviously\nbelong in this book. I feel that I must apologize, also, for the absence\nof Mr Carl Sandburg, an absence for which my own critical perversity is\nalone responsible. Mr Sandburg’s poetry interests me in the mass, if I\nmay put it so, but disappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The preface to\nthe ML edition reads: “I feel that I must apologize for the absence of\nMr. Carl Sandburg, Mr. Ezra Pound, and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, an absence\nfor which my own critical perversity is alone responsible. The work of\nthese three poets interests me in the mass, if I may put it so, but\ndisappoints me in the item” (p. vi). The revised edition (137.2)\npublished in spring 1945 includes eleven poems by Pound and four by\nSandburg but none by Masters.\n\nLater in 1945 Cerf refused to allow Aiken to include any of Pound’s\npoems in the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American\nPoetry* (G68), the American portion of which consisted of a repackaging\nof Aiken’s *Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2).\n\n#### 137.1b.

They speak for a half\ncentury of growth in America.” (*Fall 1955*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published March 1945. *WR* not found. First\nprinting: 3,000 copies.\n\nAiken suggested revising and modernizing *Modern American Poets* in 1932\n(Aiken to Cerf, 6 March 1932), but Cerf did not pursue the idea until\nfall 1943, when Aiken revised both of his ML anthologies. Poets that\nAiken wanted to add to the twentieth-century anthology included Pound,\nArchibald MacLeish, John Crowe Ransom, and Marianne Moore. He indicated\nthat he would increase the number of poems by Wallace Stevens and T. S.\nEliot, cut back Alfred Kreymborg and James Gould Fletcher, and eliminate\nMaxwell Bodenheim altogether (Aiken to Cerf, 18 November 1943). He also\nexpressed the intention of reducing the number of his own poems.\nHowever, when *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was in galley proofs\nLinscott pointed out that Aiken occupied more space than any poet except\nEliot (Linscott to Aiken, 20 September 1944). At that point Aiken\neliminated all but two of his own poems.\n\nWartime paper shortages prevented the ML from keeping all of its titles\nin print. By 1944 over a hundred titles were out of stock, and ML\nauthors could no longer count on regular royalty income. Aiken wrote\nthat fall, “What’s this gloomy news that the anthologies and other Mod\nLib titles are going out of print, for lack of paper. This is indeed\nserious for us, as that their semi-annual royalty is practically our\nlifeline, and I don’t believe god will look after us if the Mod Lib\ndoesn’t. Could you let me know what the situation really is, please sir?\nWill we get any royalties at all? Are the new editions coming out this\nyear, or ever? Heaven have mercy upon us. This would be a body blow”\n(Aiken to Linscott, 4 November 1944). Linscott assured him that both of\nhis ML anthologies were in print and that the revised editions would be\nprinted when current stocks were exhausted (Linscott, 8 November 1944).\n\nThe revised editions, both of which had 1944 copyright dates, appeared\nearly in 1945 and sold out quickly. The ML hoped to make two additional\nprintings of each anthology for a total of 21,000 copies for the year,\nbut Linscott warned: “In view of the fluctuating paper situation and the\npossibility that there will be another drastic cut before the end of the\nyear, it is difficult even to speculate on the number of your\nanthologies which we shall be able to print. . . . Please don’t count\ntoo heavily on these two additional printings, as there are so many\ndemands that it may be simply impossible to allocate the necessary\npaper” (Linscott to Aiken, 19 March 1945).\n\n*Twentieth-Century American Poetry* was out of stock for about six\nmonths in 1946, and the ML advanced Aiken $500 against 1947 royalties to\nhelp him get back to the United States from England (Linscott to Aiken,\n6 November 1946). Not until fall 1948 could the ML announce, “Every\ntitle in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now in\nstock for the first time since the war” (*PW*, 18 September 1948, p.\n1095).\n\n#### 137.3a.

(*Spring 1963*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1963. *WR* 22 April 1963. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies.\n\nAiken expressed interest in revising *Twentieth-Century American Poetry*\nin 1957 and raised the issue again shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH\n(Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 19 February 1957; Aiken to Epstein, 8\nFebruary 1959). Plans for a revised edition were under way by 1960.\nEpstein indicated that the cost of permissions for new poems would be at\nleast $4,000. Aiken had to make certain that the length of the revised\nanthology did not exceed that of the previous edition by more than a\nthird. If it exceeded that limit the revision would be regarded as a new\ncollection, and it would require new permissions fees for *all* the\npoems (Epstein to Aiken, 12 September 1960). By cutting 80 pages from\nthe 1945 text, Aiken was able to add about 200 pages of new material\n(Aiken to Epstein, 13 January 1962).\n\nAiken’s royalty was increased from 8 to 10 cents a copy. “In 1969 there\nwas a printing of 5,000 copies. Since then there have been six printings\ntotaling 26,575 copies.” The anthology was reprinted eight times before\n1982 for a total of 47,000 copies in print (Bonnell and Bonnell, pp.\n109, 120).\n\n#### 137.3b.

Publication\nannounced for April 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1931.\n\nIt is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green\nShutters* under the author’s full name rather than his better-known\npseudonym George Douglas.\n\nSeltzer described *The House with the Green Shutters* as follows: “. . .\nthis famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern\nfiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young\nScotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first\nbook that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and\nmoods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were\nequally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction\nto the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels\nwritten in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make\ntwenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the\nModern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).\n\nBroun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926)\nbut failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in\nits place was originally written as an article for the British\nperiodical *John O’London’s Weekly* (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never\ncopyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at\nthe last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the\nML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the\nintroduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its\nuse. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter\nof protest to *Saturday Review of Literature* (“A Writer’s Grievance,”\n*SRL*, 10 September 1927, p. 110).\n\nCerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize *The House with\nthe Green Shutters*, including distributing a portion of the first\nprinting at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it\nfailed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of\n8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second\nprinting of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it\nmight catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the\nend of the year."

Abstraction, insinuation\n> and particularity are inextricably commingled in M. de Gourmont’s\n> limpid and flexibly articulated prose.\n>\n> Aldous Huxley, undertaking the translation of the novel, conserved the\n> flavor of the original and unobtrusively contributed to it the\n> authentic energy of the English idiom. The result is a fresh product,\n> almost a recreation of the French original, and may be considered\n> almost as much a Huxley item as a De Gourmont.\n>\n> (Remy de Gourmont’s “A Night in the Luxembourg” is volume Number 120\n> in the Modern Library) (Spring 1927)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D.

New\nedition published by the Adelphi Co., 1925, shortly before its\nacquisition by Greenberg: Publisher; subsequently published by\nGreenberg. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–236) printed from Adelphi/Greenberg\nplates. Published June 1927. *WR* 16 July 1927. First printing: 6,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1933.\n\nEdmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical\nchampion of the \\[Symbolist\\] movement” (*Axel’s Castle*, p. 22).\n\nHuxley’s translation of *A Virgin Heart* appeared in the U.S. five years\nbefore Allen & Unwin published it in Britain.\n\nThe ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000\ncopies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated\n*A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley\ndeclined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh\nhis memory of *A Virgin Heart* and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to\nCerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an\nintroduction.\n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year\nafter the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain,\nnoting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our\nModern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the\nspirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this\ntitle has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg,\n21 October 1927).\n\nThere were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between\nNovember 1928 and December 1931. After *A Virgin Heart* was\ndiscontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold,\nmost of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June\n1933).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nGourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926–1932) 125"

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nShortly after publication of *The Philosophy of William James* (119)\nCerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to\nBertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to\nhave declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife\nto the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed\nto select the contents and secure permissions from the original\npublishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond\nwriting the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of\nthe editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:\n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell\n> matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction\n> to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last\n> Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him,\n> however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what\n> selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much\n> better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!”\n> (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926)\n\nKomroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He\nwent on:\n\n> I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark\n> to \\[*sic*\\] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured.\n> The whole sceme \\[*sic*\\] was my idea in the first place and it would\n> have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little\n> volume of Russell’s Writings.

(*Fall 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s *Life of Jesus*\n> was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and\n> literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation\n> created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its\n> most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete\n> accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry\n> with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the\n> beginnings of the Christian era. (*Spring 1937*)\n\nThe ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was\noriginally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML\nedition (pp. \\[*5*–*7*\\], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with\nHutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. \\[*5*\\]\nreset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction.\nPublished December 1927. *WR* 7 January 1928. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nTwo other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. *The\nLife of Jesus* was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton,\n1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation\nby the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd\nFrench edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations,\nwas published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little,\nBrown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on\neconomic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have\nrequired royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public\ndomain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for\nthe ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson\ntranslation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying\nroyalties and the cost of resetting the text.\n\nKlopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The\nRenan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore”\n(Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University\nLibrary; published in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p.\n87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as\n“Renoir”).

It is\n> a *tour de force* of heart-pounding relentlessness that strips naked\n> the terror-stricken soul of a Negro. *The Straw* reveals another facet\n> of Eugene O’Neill’s many-sided genius. (*Spring 1935*)\n\n*The Emperor Jones* and *The Straw* originally published by Boni &\nLiveright, 1921, in a volume with O’Neill’s *Diff’rent*. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced\nfor April 1928. *WR* 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1937. Superseded February 1937 by *The Emperor\nJones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape* (299).\n\nDudley Nichols of the *New York World* wrote the introduction after\nO’Neill declined to write it himself (Cerf to O’Neill, 7 December 1927;\nCerf to Nichols, 7 February 1928).\n\nO’Neill made several revisions in the text of *The Emperor Jones* when\nhe prepared it for *The Complete Works of Eugene O’Neill* (2 vols., Boni\n& Liveright, 1924). The most notable were the cutting of speeches by\nSmithers at the end of Scene One and the end of the play. In the revised\nversion Scene One ends as follows:\n\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">Smithers \\[</span>*Looks after him with a\n> puzzled admiration*\\]: ’E’s got ’is bloomin’ nerve with ’im, s’elp me.\n> \\[*Then angrily*.\\] Ho—the bleedin’ nigger—puttin’ on ’is bloody airs!\n> I ’opes they naps ’im an’ gives ’im an’ gives ’im what’s what!\n\nThe original version continues:\n\n> \\[*Then putting business before the pleasure of this thought, looking\n> around him with cupidity.*\\] A bloke ought to find a ’ole lot in this\n> palace that’d go for a bit of cash.

The 1972 Vintage Books edition of *The Emperor Jones,\nAnna Christie, The Hairy Ape*, which superseded the Modern Library\nedition and is printed from plates made from a new typesetting, uses the\noriginal text. The original version also appears in *Six Modern American\nPlays* (441).\n\nIn contrast, O’Neill’s *Nine Plays* (G53), published in 1941 as a ML\nGiant and printed from plates originally used by Liveright, Inc. in 1932\nand later by Random House, has the revised version of *The Emperor\nJones*. The revised version also appears in the 3-volume *Plays of\nEugene O’Neill* (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition\nwas originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951\nwhen *The Iceman Cometh* was added.\n\n*The Emperor Jones; The Straw*, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th\nbest-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928. Sales through\n1932 were as follows: 5,855 copies (1928); 2,901 copies (1929); 1,921\ncopies (1930); 1,405 copies (1931); 756 copies (1932) (Cerf to O’Neill,\n2 June 1933).\n\nThe ML paid royalties to Boni & Liveright of 10 cents a copy.\n\nO’Neill became a Random House author after the Liveright bankruptcy in\n1933. Saxe Commins, his editor at Liveright, also moved to Random House.\nIn choosing between Coward-McCann and Random House, O’Neill wrote:\n\n> Cerf . . . has drive and enthusiasm, coupled with keen shrewdness.\n> Moreover, I felt Coward was trade publisher, pure and simple—but Cerf\n> has more to his publishing than that, a love of beautiful books, an\n> appreciation for good literature, an ambition to keep his firm above\n> the level of the others, to expand only along lines of distinction.\n> That, of course, appealed strongly to me. As for background for my\n> stuff, there is no comparison. . . . Cerf has two unique things—Modern\n> Library and Random House.\n\nHe also thought Random House would offer better opportunities for\nCommins:\n\n> I feel strongly that Cerf is the better bet for your present and\n> future . . . with him, you will have a real chance to do your stuff\n> and a most congenial atmosphere. . . .

Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions\n> and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety.\n> Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of\n> temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils\n> its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete\n> and unabridged version.

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is\ntraditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its\ninclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R. \nH. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury\nthe ML abandoned after the first printing.\n\nThe omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of *Tristam Shandy*\ntraditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There\nis no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there\nis a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the\nbook by it . . .” (p. 281).\n\n*Tristram Shandy* was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the\nfirst six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales.

Discontinued fall 1934.\n\nCerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the\nrights to *Twelve Men*. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of\n$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October\n1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for\nroyalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&L for the\nuse of their plates. B&L received $200 for approving the ML reprint;\nthis appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was\ndeducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received\n$1,000 when the contract was signed.\n\nDreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the *New York Sun* (13\nApril 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken\n$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but\nMencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis\nto write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked *Twelve Men*\nvery much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf\nto Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928).\nCharles Merz of the *New York World* also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou\nof the *Chicago Daily News*, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought\nto be doing this himself” (p. v).\n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *Twelve Men* ranked 34th\namong the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of\n1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales\nfell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser\nfile) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies\n(1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421\ncopies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).\n\nSeveral years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that\n*Twelve Men* was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers,\nSimon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability\nto furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep\nmy works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me\nwithout a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at\nleast, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf\nexplained why *Twelve Men* had been discontinued and added, “I believe\nthat one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained\npopular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles\neach year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit,\nthereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their\nkeeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to\nDreiser, 10 April 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDreiser, *Free and Other Stories* (1924–1931) 106\n\nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932–1971) 230\n\nDreiser, *American Tragedy* (Giant, 1956–1968) G89"

Discontinued fall 1936.\n\nThe ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of\nthe title page states: “*Printed by the* <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">aquatone process</span> *by* | *Edward Stern &\nCompany, Inc.*”\n\nThere were at least two printings of *The Art of Whistler*. The\nstatement “*First Modern Library Edition* | 1928” appears to have been\nretained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition”\nstatement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first\nprinting; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such\nstatements on all printings.\n\nThe ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’\nprevious biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97).\n*The Life of James McNeill Whistler* by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and\nJoseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B.\nLippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911.\nJoseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to\nedit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the\nmanuscript on her own.\n\nKlopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the\nmanuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss\nto determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the\nauthor. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her\nhome in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his\nmid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer\nstruggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs.\nPennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the\nmanuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November\n1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).\n\nShortly after publication of *The Art of Whistler* Klopfer invited Mrs.\nPennell to edit a companion volume, *The Art of Joseph Pennell* (Klopfer\nto Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.\n\nKlopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain\nbefore he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of *The\nArt of Whistler* in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn\nnear our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we\ndon’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane,\n11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s *Lives of the Twelve Caesars*\n(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no\nillustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.\n\n***Fall***"

There were other problems as\nwell. In one letter he told Cerf, “I had worked about six hours a day\nfor a week on Rabelais . . . and then you told me the whole thing must\nbe expurgated” (Douglas to Cerf, 6 October 1927). When he finally\nsubmitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever\ndid in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).\n\nDouglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse\nRabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells\nwould say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the\nimmense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth\nor turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of\nstones. By the laws of our own age it has become necessary and\nobligatory” (pp. ix–x). Douglas’s edition was superseded in 1944 by\n*The* *Complete Works* *of Rabelais* (G66) in an unabridged translation\nby Jacques Le Clercq.\n\n*Gargantua and Pantagruel* ranked in the middle of the third quarter of\nML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942‑October\n1943.\n\nThe ML plates were used by Walter J.

(*Spring\n> 1934*)\n\nTranslation by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson originally published in U.S. by John\nLane, 1914, and from 1922 by Dodd, Mead & Co. ML edition (pp. \\[1–4\\],\n7–348) printed from a duplicate set of Lane/Dodd, Mead plates with\nrunning heads removed and original page numerals in the headline\nreplaced by smaller numerals placed closer to the text. Published\nSeptember 1928. *WR* 13 October 1928. First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nThe Dodd, Mead trade edition of *The Revolt of the Angels* was an\nattractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page\n(text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins.\nThe Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid\ntypesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a type\npage that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard\ntrim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem. \\[scan of Dodd, Mead ed.\nw ML Jacket Scans file\\]\n\nIn the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by\nphotographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the\ntype page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The\nquality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were\nhigher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf\nand Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an\noption in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were\ndeveloped in the early part of the century, but it was not until the\n1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method,\nand it was not until after World War II that it became a major book\nprinting industry. The method would have had more use in its early days\nhad it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not\nwell enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked\nlithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2nd ed., p. 136).\n\nThe Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd,\nMead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals\nwere part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page\nnumerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the\nfirst line of text, and they were set in a different font that was\nsmaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals.\nMargins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was\n⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted\nto the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The\nresult was the one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever\nproduced.\n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* sold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter.\nThe ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of\n17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings\nof 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly\nbefore the final printing.

Discontinued\nfall 1949.\n\nML sales of *Mrs. Dalloway* totaled 61,000 copies (Kirkpatrick,\n*Virginia Woolf*, p. 26). *Mrs. Dalloway* sold 4,271 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML titles in terms of sales. *To the Lighthouse* (306) was in\nthe fourth quarter during this period with sales of 3,203 copies.\n\nLewis Miller, the RH sales manager, reviewed the jacket design that\nAngelo originally submitted and asked for revisions: “Would you try to\ndo the lettering for the title in a little simpler fashion to increase\nvisibility. Also the pinkish lettering against the white is perhaps not\nstrong enough. Could I recommend that you think in terms of a darker ink\nfor the lettering?” (Miller to Angelo, 15 March 1939).\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning postwar\ncollege market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s\nreprint contracts for *Mrs. Dalloway*, *To the Lighthouse*, and seven\nother titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis,\nKatherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,\nBrace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 1,400 copies of\n*Mrs. Dalloway* in stock. Klopfer estimated that it would take six\nmonths for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June\n1948).\n\n#### 168b.

Discontinued 1978/79. *Note:* The copyright date is 1944,\nbut publication of *A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry* appears\nto have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper\nshortages.\n\n*A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* also comprised the\nAmerican portion of the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and\nAmerican Poetry* (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s\ninsistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra\nPound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was\nlater returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf\nignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve\nomitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been\n“overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include\na single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was\nfocused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any\nsuggestion of purging Pound from *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* or *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (137.2), both of which\nwere published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s\npoems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the\n1947 printing (see G68).\n\nSince the regular ML edition of *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from\ndifferent type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two\nformats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of\nthe two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of\nthe Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books\nare printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point\nsize. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the\nheadline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type\npages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the\nGiant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page,\nbut there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the\nregular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries,\nindexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular\nedition and 420 pages in the Giant.\n\n*American Poetry 1671*–*1928* and *A Comprehensive Anthology of American\nPoetry* do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee\nCullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American\npoet. These and other African American poets had been represented in *An\nAnthology of American Negro Literature* (183), edited by V. F. Calverton\nand published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s\nanthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time *A\nComprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* appeared in 1945. The\nrevised edition of *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (372),\nedited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and\n1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies”\nedited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice\nM. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of\nCalverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have\noccurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets\nfrom his anthology.\n\n#### 169.2b.

Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to\nme much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much\ntoo much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo.\nAnd what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story”\n(Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to\nDurant, 10 September 1928). Durant indicated that he didn’t have time to\nmake changes, and the ML published *Salammbô* without an introduction.\n\nFour years after *Salammbô* was discontinued, James T. Farrell suggested\nFlaubert’s *Sentimental* *Education* for the ML (Farrell to Cerf, 1\nFebruary 1939). Cerf responded, “I am sorry to say that I see little\npoint in adding another Flaubert title to the Modern Library at this\ntime. We had to drop out both SALAMMBO and THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY\nbecause of complete lack of demand, and even MADAME BOVARY doesn’t sell\none-quarter of what it did ten and fifteen years ago” (Cerf to Farrell,\n2 February 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nFlaubert, *Madame Bovary* (1917– ) 25\n\nFlaubert, *Temptation of St. Anthony* (1921–1933) 82"

Cerf and Klopfer decided to assume the cost\nof original composition and announced that the ML edition was the first\nto be printed in the United States. Other publishers, they noted,\n“always imported it from England rather than undergo the great expense\nof making a new set of plates for so lengthy a book” (ML circular, RH\nbox 133, Advertising 1929 folder 2). At 988 pages *The Brothers\nKaramazov* was longest book the ML had published up to that time.\n\n*The Brothers Karamazov* sold about 30,000 copies in its first\ntwo-and-a-half years in the ML (Cerf to Robert Linscott, 9 October\n1931).

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1973/74.\n\nThe Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the\ntext and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of\n10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new\nplates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first\n30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a $3,400 advance in December 1928\nagainst royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.\n\nIn 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of *Cyrano de\nBergerac* at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the\npresident of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed\nconcern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but\nhe acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely\nputting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your\nmind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at\nhigh schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have\nproposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on\nyour own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18\nJune 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).\n\n*Cyrano de Bergerac* ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during\nthe 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth\nbest-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October\n1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose\nFerrer.\n\n#### 174.1b.

He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is\nsuperb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though\na perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was\ninherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider\nchanging the translation, which had “established itself as standard for\nmany college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953;\nCommins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton\nUniversity Library). Le Clercq’s translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac*\ndoes not appear to have been published.\n\nBy 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML\nedition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep *Cyrano* in\nthe series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt\naccept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new\nplates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time\nHolt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C.\nEdwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May\n1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the\nmid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy."

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Albert & Charles Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[iii\\], \\[3\\]–230) printed from Boni plates. The heading of the\ncontents page of Boni printings was changed from *The Cabala* to\n*Contents* at some point between the sixth printing (January 1928) and\nthe tenth printing (August 1928); ML printings use the second version of\nthe contents page. Published April 1929. *WR* 11 May 1929. First\nprinting: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1937.\n\nCerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know\nthat you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote,\n“particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an\nintroduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to\nsend it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is\ngoing to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford\nto buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be\nmade up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words\nstating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in\nthis edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double\nthe ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the\nlast moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an\nintroduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March\n1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the\nend of March.\n\n*The Cabala* sold well during its first two or three years in the\nseries. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and\nanother printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in\nthe RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933."

It is the story of Julien\n> Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose\n> prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless\n> egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the\n> calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent\n> Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are\n> intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The\n> contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict\n> between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp\n> in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois\n> mores and French society, *The Red and the Black* established Stendhal\n> as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.\n\nPublished fall 1984 at $9.95.

Knopf, his American\npublisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached\nKnopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He\ntold Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an\nintroduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s\nusual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf\nto Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that *Humphry Clinker*, “the\nwork of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he\nthought that *Roderick Random* was “more characteristically Smollett:\nrough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin\nwith. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with\nhis order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April\n1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he\nwrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.\n\n*Humphry Clinker* ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943.

Her life was consecrated to love. As it was with Shulamite,\nwho inspired Solomon’s Song of Songs, so love had set a seal upon\nLilly’s heart. All the denials of poverty, the violences of lechery and\nthe longings of her own dream world only made her more desirable in the\neyes of men. Hermann Sudermann’s novel of a woman who walked in sin is a\nromance in the cause of love beyond purity. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nSeltzer translation originally published by B. W.

Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders,\ninforming them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected\nsheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s\ntruckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s\nstock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,”\nhe stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly\nprinted” (Klopfer to Miss J. A.

At\nthis time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering\nresentment over the ML edition of *Green Mansions* (90). However, Cerf\nhad become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying\nto put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928).\nRelations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929\nluncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a $1,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy for *Peter Whiffle*. He also\noffered to pay Van Vechten $100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an\nintroduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated\nthat he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van\nVechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf\nturned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929). *Peter\nWhiffle* was the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the\nML.\n\nThere was a second printing of 1,000 copies in August 1932."

Advance\nadvertising referred to the Chapman translations, as did fall 1929\ncatalogs and ML lists—including the lists inside first printings of the\nHomer jackets. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *The Iliad* and the\nButcher and Lang translation of *The Odyssey* were substituted at the\nlast moment on the advice of several college professors. “We discovered\nthat we could sell five times as many books in the new translation as we\ncould have had we used the Chapman, since the Lang, Leaf, and Myers one\nis used in almost all of the colleges” (Cerf to George M. McKanday,\nMacmillan Co. of Canada, 25 November 1930).\n\nThe Prefatory Note (p. \\[*5*\\]) indicates that Books I–IX were\ntranslated by Leaf, X–XVI by Lang, and XVII–XXIV by Myers, but that the\nwhole was revised by all three translators.\n\nThe ML hoped to use Macmillan plates, but Macmillan had to secure\napproval from its parent firm in London and was unable to make a solid\noffer until the end of October.

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by the Macmillan Co., 1898 (*The Turn of the\nScrew*) and 1892 (*The Lesson of the Master*). ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for January\n1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nThe ML’s original intent was to publish *The Turn of the Screw* only, to\nprint from Macmillan plates, and to pay a $1,000 advance against\nroyalties of 8 cents a copy (H. C. Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26\nNovember 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to\nwrite an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March\n1929).\n\nFinal publication plans took shape in January 1930, when Macmillan\ngranted permission to add *The Lesson of the Master* for an additional\npayment of $100 (Latham to ML, 10 January 1930). Broun’s introduction,\ndated January 1930, makes no reference to *The Lesson of the Master*.\nThe ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed\npublication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both\nworks entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying\nroyalties of 2 cents a copy.\n\n*The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* ranked in the third\nquarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May\n1942–October 1943, just below *The Portrait of a Lady* (291). James’s\nsales improved significantly by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952 *The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of\nthe Master* sold 3,734 copies, making it seventy-fourth of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.

(*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Instead of beginning his career as a writer of promise, Ernest\n> Hemingway startled the world, and especially his own generation, with\n> *The Sun Also Rises*, his first full-length novel. The disinherited\n> and disillusioned survivors of the World War discovered in him their\n> spokesman, a writer free of sentimentality and cant who could summon\n> forth characters true to their own experience and way of life. *The\n> Sun Also Rises* is a chronicle of a lost generation drifting,\n> frustrated and demoralized, to its doom. (*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1926. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xi\\]–259) printed from Scribner plates. Published February 1930. *WR*\n8 March 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1953.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy. Cerf had approached Scribner’s about a ML edition as early as\n1927, when he offered a $1,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a\ncopy (Cerf to Scribner’s, 17 September 1927). After meeting Cerf in New\nYork Hemingway urged Scribner’s to let the ML have the book. He was\npleased that *The Sun Also Rises* was to appear in the series. But he\ndeclined Cerf’s offer of $200 to write an introduction—four times what\nF. Scott Fitzgerald received in 1934 for his introduction to the ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*—explaining that he couldn’t write an\nintroduction to any book, least of all to one of his own. “I feel to\nwrite it would be taking $200 out of some critics \\[*sic*\\] pocket—but\nbeside that I swear to you I couldn’t write it if I tried” (Hemingway to\nCerf, 4 January 1930).\n\nPrintings through 1934 were as follows: 5,000 copies (November 1930),\n5,000 copies (October 1931), 3,000 copies (July 1933), 2,000 copies\n(December 1934). *The Sun Also Rises* was the eighteenth best-selling ML\ntitle during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file).\nIt sold 7,054 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943,\nplacing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales.\nIt sold 5,678 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it thirty-third out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML.\n\nCuriously, the 1949 Bantam paperback edition of *The Sun Also Rises*,\ndespite the claim on the front cover that the text is “Complete and\nUnabridged,’ omits more than twenty references to Robert Cohn being\nJewish. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 retains the passage that he\nlearned boxing “to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he\nhad felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton” (p. 1) but alters the\nthird paragraph from “Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of\none of the richest Jewish families in New York . . .” to “one of the\nrichest families in New York” (p. 2). Another example comes from Chapter\nXVIII, where the Scribner/Modern Library text reads “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out\nbadly” (p. 214). The 1949 Bantam edition reads: “Brett’s got a\nbull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull fighter” (p. 176).\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three\nHemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29\nOctober 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *The Sun Also\nRises* would be out of stock soon (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nreprint in April 1953 and a $1.45 paperback in August 1957.\n\n#### 190b.

(*Fall 1952*)\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML.\nSeveral authors were asked to write the introduction before Troyat\naccepted the assignment. Stein’s first choice was René Wellek of Yale\nUniversity. Wellek declined because of other commitments and observed,\n“Mrs. Garnett for some strange reason . . . chose to call the husband of\nAnna Karenina also Karenina though this a feminine form and means Mrs.\nKarenin. He should be Karenin throughout the book” (Wellek to Stein, 28\nJanuary 1950). He also noted a few other errors in the ML’s text that\nwere corrected in the plates for the MLCE printing. Stein offered to\nextend the deadline to enable Wellek to write the introduction. Wellek\nwas willing, but instead of the ML’s $200 fee he wanted a $500 advance\nagainst a small royalty, which was the arrangement he had with Rinehart\nfor his introduction to Gogol’s *Dead Souls*. Stein indicated that $200\nwas all the ML could pay, and Wellek declined a second time (Wellek to\nStein, 3 February 1950 and 1 March 1950). Richard G. Salomon of Kenyon\nCollege and Vladimir Nabokov, who was then teaching at Cornell\nUniversity, also declined. Nabokov indicated that he could not write an\nintroduction for a translation he had not checked for errors and that in\nany case his fee would be $500 (Nabokov telegram to Stein, 17 March\n1950).\n\nTroyat agreed to write the introduction for the ML’s $200 fee (Troyat to\nStein, 24 March 1950). It was written in French and translated by J.\nRobert Loy of Columbia University."

It is told with the\n> irrepressible mirth and flavor of that shrewd and ever-fascinating\n> promenader among the seven arts— James Huneker. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1920. New bibliographical\nedition published by Horace Liveright, 1928. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–310)\nprinted from 1928 Liveright plates with pp. \\[5\\] and \\[9\\] transposed.\nPublished March 1930. *WR* 12 April 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1942.\n\nThe ML paid Liveright a $5,000 advance. *Painted Veils* was the ML’s\nbest-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises*\n(190) and Merejkowski’s *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154). It\ncontinued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty\nbest-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117,\nPublicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in\nSeptember 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML\nprintings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.\n\nShortly after *Painted Veils* was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith,\nthe editor-in-chief of Boni & Liveright, suggested a ML edition of\nHuneker’s autobiography *Steeplejack* (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930).\nCerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you\nreally think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no\nquestion that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to\nSmith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles\nScribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker\ntitles it published, such as *Essays*, selected and introduced by H. L.\nMencken (1929) or *Steeplejack*. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s\nglory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern\nLibrary (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936).\nThe ML edition of *Painted Veils* was discontinued six years later.\n\n#### 192b.

(*Spring 1930*)\n\nOriginally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1922. ML edition\n(195.1a<sub>1</sub>, pp. \\[iii\\]–vii, 14–336) printed from corrected\nHolt plates with the introduction (pp. 1–13) omitted; 195.1a<sub>2</sub>\nand subsequent printings of 195.1 are printed from the same plates and\ninclude the introduction. Published April 1930. *WR* not found. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1986/87.\n\nCerf initially approached Holt about a ML edition in 1927, offering an\nadvance of $560 against royalties of 8 cents a copy (Cerf to Elliot\nHolt, 1 April 1927). Holt replied that the book continued to sell as a\ncollege text and the College Department objected to a ML edition (E.\nHolt to Cerf, 2 April 1927). Cerf tried again the following year when\nHerschel Brickell became head of the trade department after a\nreorganization of the firm. “I wish some day, that you could convince\nthe new bosses that it might be a good thing for them to let us do John\nDewey’s ‘Human Nature and Conduct’ in the Modern Library. We pay 10¢ a\ncopy royalty a book, and do a first edition of 7500 copies, with a first\npayment of $750.00 upon signing of the contract. If you could put that\nover for us, you would win our undying devotion” (Cerf to Brickell, 13\nFebruary 1928).\n\nBy 1929 arrangements for a ML edition were moving forward. Brickell told\nCerf that he had written to Dewey for permission to proceed (Brickell to\nCerf, 10 September 1929). Three weeks later Cerf asked Dewey to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition, offering him a fee of $100 and\nsuggesting Havelock Ellis’s introduction to *The Dance of Life*\n(1929:180) as a model (Cerf to Dewey, 1 October 1929). Dewey agreed to\nwrite the introduction and sent a list of corrections to the text (Dewey\nto Cerf, 8 November 1929). Cerf asked Holt to charge the corrections to\nthe ML’s account, but Holt corrected the plates at its own expense.\nDewey’s new introduction was titled “Foreword to the Modern Library\nEdition” since *Human Nature and Conduct* already included a preface and\nan introduction by Dewey.\n\nSomeone appears to have assumed that Dewey’s new foreword superseded his\nintroduction to the original edition, even though the introduction was\npaginated in Arabic numerals (pp. 1–13) and therefore was clearly part\nof the text. The first ML printing omitted the introduction. When the\nmistake was discovered the eighth leaf of the first gathering, with the\nlast page of the contents on its recto and page 14 of Dewey’s text on\nits verso, was canceled in all remaining copies of the first printing.\nIn its place a newly printed sheet consisting of a sewn gathering of 8\nleaves (16 pages) was pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf in all\nremaining copies, thereby creating the second state of the first\nprinting. The 16-page gathering consisted of p. vii (the last page of\nthe contents with its verso blank), Dewey’s introduction (pp. 1–13), and\nthe first page of Part One of Dewey’s text (p. 14). With the creation of\nthe second state of the first printing (195.1a<sub>2</sub>) uncorrected\ncopies became the first state of the first printing.\n\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in December 1930 and a third\nprinting of 3,000 copies in August 1931. There were at least nine\nprintings between March 1933 and May 1943 totaling 15,000 copies. A\nprinting of 5,000 copies (March 1945) followed the end of wartime paper\nrationing.\n\n*Human Nature and Conduct* was low in the third quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It\nranked solidly in the second quarter of ML titles by the 12-month period\nNovember 1952–October 1953.\n\n**195.1a**<sub>2</sub>**.

ML edition (pp. \\[*5*\\]–766) printed from\nDoubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting. Published September\n1930. *WR* 18 October 1930. First printing: 15,000 copies.\n\nCerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four\nlong-sought Doubleday titles—*Of Human Bondage*, Walpole’s *Fortitude*\n(201), Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203), and Bennett’s *Old Wives’\nTale* (207)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden\nCity Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML paid a\n$6,000 advance for *Of Human Bondage* and agreed to pay royalties of 12\ncents a copy for each of the four titles, two cents more than it was\nthen paying for any title with the exception of Dreiser’s *Twelve Men*\n(159). All four were added to the ML between September 1930 and January\n1931. Doubleday’s new plates *Of Human Bondage* were originally intended\nfor the ML’s exclusive use, but they were used for a printing by Garden\nCity Publishing Co. around 1933.\n\nIn April 1968 the royalty increased from 12 cents a copy to 10 percent\nof the list price, which was then $2.45. Royalties on the Vintage\npaperback edition increased to 15 percent of the list price. RH paid a\n$30,000 advance against royalties for both editions. A third of the\ntotal was paid on signing, with subsequent payments of $10,000 due on1\nJanuary 1969 and 1 January 1970.\n\nIn 1968 the ML considered transferring *Of Human Bondage* to the Giants\nseries, which would have involved photographing the book and making new\nplates. In the end it was decided to leave it in the regular ML.\n\n*Of Human Bondage* was one of the ML’s perennial best-selling titles. It\nranked eighth in terms of sales in 1930 despite its fall publication\ndate, moved up to second place during the first six months of 1931 (RH\nbox 117, Publicity file), and appears to have been in first place in\n1934. Cerf reported sales for its first five years in the series as\nfollows: 12,281 copies; 15,818 copies; 9,091 copies; 9,974 copies; and\n11,277 copies (the figures appear to be for twelve-month periods but not\ncalendar years). He indicated later that over 80,000 copies had been\nsold by the end of 1938 (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938; Cerf\nto Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). During the\n18-month period May 1942–October 1943 *Of Human Bondage* sold 18,505\ncopies, making it the best-selling title in the regular ML and the\nfourth best-selling title in the series as a whole. It sold 1,500 more\ncopies than Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228), then the second\nbest-selling title in the regular series. By the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s best-selling title with sales\nof 11,563 copies.\n\n#### 199.1b.

The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of\n12 cents a copy. Cerf told the press agent Lynn Farnol that Walpole\nreceived the highest advance against royalties that the ML had ever paid\n(Cerf to Farnol, 14 May 1941), but the amount was not indicated—and of\ncourse the advance would have been paid to Doubleday, Doran, which would\nhave split it with Walpole.\n\nCerf was unhappy with the appearance of the first printing. The plates,\nhe told Doubleday, “are lousy, and we need some new ones” (Cerf to\nRobert de Graff, Garden City Pub. Co., 5 November 1930). When he sent a\ncopy of the first printing to Walpole he apologized for its appearance\nand indicated that Doubleday had promised to supply new plates for\nsubsequent printings (Cerf to Walpole, 26 November 1930).\n\n*Fortitude* was in the middle of the fourth quarter of ML titles in\nterms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943.

No evidence of\na printing in Star Dollar Books or any other Doubleday imprint has been\nfound.\n\nCharles Boni used the ML plates in 1930 for a single printing of *The\nMedici* in the format the ML would adopt the following year for the new\nML Giants series. Later that year Cerf and Klopfer bought the remaining\nstock from A. & C. Boni and sold it along with a printing of *The\nEducation of Henry Adams* that they had produced in a similar format.\nThe books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to\ndepartment stores as dollar “specials.”\n\nAn illustrated edition of *The Medici* (G8), printed from plates of the\nregular ML edition, was published in ML Giants, 1933–49.\n\n*The Medici* was one of several titles that were omitted from a\ncomprehensive ranking of ML sales for the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943.

ML edition\nprinted from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting that\nappears to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published November\n1930. *WR* 29 November 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued\n1967.\n\n*Point Counter Point* was one of four Doubleday titles to which the ML\nsecured reprint rights at the time it purchased the Sun Dial Library\nfrom Garden City Publishing Co. (see 199). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran\na $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Most ML royalties\nwere based on the number of copies printed; the royalties for *Point\nCounter Point* were based on sales.\n\nThere was a second printing of 5,000 copies in August 1931 and a third\nprinting of 4,000 copies in November 1932. *Point Counter Point* was low\nin the first quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943. Sales improved significantly by the early\n1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 *Point\nCounter Point* was the 27th best-selling title in the ML.\n\nIn 1939 Doubleday, Doran sold its plates and the publishing rights to\nHuxley’s older books to Harper & Bros. Cerf expressed the hope that\n*Point Counter Point* and *Antic Hay* could remain in the ML “for a long\ntime to come” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939).\nHarper’s considered publishing the titles in full-priced editions at\n$2.50 and was concerned about the income it could expect from the ML\neditions. Unless the income was substantial, Hoyns indicated, the ML\neditions “might turn out to be a very unprofitable arrangement from our\npoint of view” (Hoyns to Klopfer, 17 March 1939).\n\nKlopfer and Hoyns met over lunch to discuss the matter. Shortly before\nthe meeting Klopfer wrote directly to Huxley, who was a personal friend:\n“Help, help, Harper’s are threatening to take POINT COUNTER POINT and\nANTIC HAY away from us. These two books belong in the Modern Library and\nit would be a crime not to have them available in a cheaper\nedition. . . . Could you influence the Harper office in any way in our\nfavor? I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can\nmake a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a\nstrong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive\nreprint, rather than just in the $2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to\nHuxley, 20 March 1939).\n\nKlopfer’s appeal appears to have been successful. Following the lunch\nKlopfer sent Hoyns new five-year contracts for the books. The *Point\nCounter Point* contract called for the ML to pay a $1,200 advance\nagainst royalties of 12 cents a copy and included a special clause that\nallowed Harper’s to cancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a\nreprint of at least 5,000 copies after three years.\n\nIn 1965 Harper & Row gave six months’ notice that the ML contract was\nbeing terminated so that *Point Counter Point* could be included in its\nown hardbound series, Perennial Classics (Virginia Olson, Harper & Row,\nto Epstein, 23 July 1965). The ML was allowed to sell out its stock on\nhand, which consisted of 4,400 copies (Epstein to Olson, 9 August 1965).\nThe ML edition was out of stock by summer 1967.\n\n#### 203b.

(*Spring 1939*)\n\nEdman’s edition of *The Works of Plato* was originally published by\nSimon and Schuster, 1928. ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published November 1930. *WR* 29 November 1930. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nEdman’s selection included ten dialogues from the third edition of *The\nDialogues of Plato*, translated into English with introductions and\nanalyses by B. Jowett (5 vols., Oxford University Press, 1892). Edman\nomitted Jowett’s lengthy introductions and analyses, but the Simon and\nSchuster edition retains Jowett’s marginal notes. Fourteen dialogues\nwere omitted. Simon and Schuster used the word “abridged” on the title\npage; the ML title page, which indicates that the volume was “selected\nand edited” by Edman, was clearer and more accurate.\n\nThe Simon and Schuster plates were too wide for the ML’s format. The ML\nreset the entire work, omitting the marginal notes. The ML paid Simon\nand Schuster royalties of 7 cents a copy, of which Edman appears to have\nreceived 5 cents.\n\n*The Works of Plato* sold 10,848 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the 26th best-selling title in the ML.\nSales were even better in the early 1950s. During the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s eighth best-selling title.\n\n#### 204b.

The ‘philosophy’ of Plato is\n> clearly not a philosophy of the schools; his drama is profounder in\n> theme and more comprehensive in range than the constricted little toys\n> of the stage. For those who have not learned with Plato that\n> philosophy is the love of wisdom rather than the pronouncement of\n> truth, there is considerable mystification in a thinker whose thoughts\n> are all suggestions, whose suggestions are often playful, and who will\n> not, despite the attempt of more than one serious critic, be crammed\n> into a neat and lifeless system. The reader is haunted, too, by the\n> perturbed sense that, though these dialogues are full of endless charm\n> as poetic and ironic drama, they are clearly more than the by-play of\n> a gifted writer. The further one reads the more deeply does one come\n> into the presence of the profoundest and most serious issues of human\n> existence. What on its winning surface is the spirited conversation\n> between Socrates and a group of attractive young Athenian aristocrats,\n> closely read, stirs one profoundly to a consideration of the nature of\n> good and evil, of reality, of the paramount mystery of the human\n> soul.” —*from the Introduction by Irwin Edman*\n\n#### 204d.

Designed by Kent; unsigned. (*Fall\n1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> More than a record of an adventure in solitude, *Wilderness* is a book\n> that re-creates the wonder and the tranquillity of an untracked world.\n> The hand and heart and mind of a distinguished artist combine, in\n> prose and pictures, to convey the topography and the moods, the\n> changing vistas and the dramatic silences of the sub-Arctic region.\n> Rockwell Kent’s text, embellished by more than fifty pictures from his\n> pen, has the excitement of a quest that attains the nearest paradise\n> man can hope for on earth. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1920, in a volume measuring\napproximately 11½ x 8 in. (280 x 200 mm). ML edition printed from plates\nmade from a new typesetting with revisions by the author and the\noriginal introduction by Dorothy Canfield replaced by Kent’s “Second\nPreface: Eleven Years Later.” The ML also omits p. \\[v\\] of the Putnam\nedition which acknowledges the owners of the illustrations reproduced in\nthe volume. Published December 1930. *WR* 27 December 1930. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued spring 1939.\n\nThe Putnam plates were far too large for the ML’s format. The\nannouncement of the ML edition stated, “For the Modern Library Edition,\nRockwell Kent has written a new introduction and made important\nrevisions in the text. The volume contains all the Kent illustrations\nthat appear in the six dollar edition” (*PW* 118, 16 August 1930, p.\n574). Kent notes in his preface to the ML edition that he has restored\n“two lines of a German folk-song that my original publishers . . . in\nthe fervor of post-war patriotism, secretly deleted, and subsequently\nwould not put back. They appear on page 68, and mean: ‘Good moon, you go\nso quietly through the evening clouds’” (p. viii). The two lines appear\nunder the heading “Friday, October eighteenth”:\n\n> “Guter Mond, du gehst so stille\n>\n> Durch die Abend Wolken hin.”\n\nThe ML typesetting uses a sans-serif typeface that suits the ML’s\nsmaller format and is more attractive than the traditional type of the\nPutnam edition. However, Kent’s illustrations are reduced in size by\nabout a half, obscuring some of the detail. The ML edition includes all\nof the illustrations in the Putnam edition. The Kent illustration on the\ntitle page of the ML edition appears on the front panel of the Putnam\nbinding.\n\nThe ML edition sold a total of 12,960 copies (James Silberman memo to\nAngus Cameron, 6 December 1965). The ML did not have exclusive reprint\nrights, and the ML edition was undermined by a full-sized $1.49 reprint\npublished by Blue Ribbon Books in 1936. Kent was unaware that Putnam was\nplanning to discontinue the original edition, and the ML was not\nconsulted about the $1.49 reprint (Cerf to Kent, 2 June 1939). Sales of\nthe ML edition in 1937-38 totaled less than 800 copies (Cerf to Kent, 2\nJune 1939). Kent bought 240 copies of the discontinued ML edition at\ntwenty-five cents each (Kent to Cerf, 8 June 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMelville, *Moby Dick*, illus.

The ML had\nexclusive reprint rights to *The Old Wives’ Tale* and paid Doubleday,\nDoran a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a\nsecond printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of\n3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in\n1933.

Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the\n> best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (*Fall 1939*)\n\nPayne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February\n1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded\n1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).\n\nCerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that *The Decameron*\nwould not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of\noccasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its\nimportation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A.\nFalk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who\nindicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include\nshocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).\n\nThe ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to\nJohn S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of\nVice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of *The\nDecameron*, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American\nuniversities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He\nstated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p.\nxxii).\n\nCerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously,\nbut Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed\nforeword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our\nfriend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I\nrather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors,\nmight shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27\nDecember 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the\ntitle page. Ernst received $50 for the foreword and $100 in legal fees.\nCerf assured booksellers in an article in *PW* that the Payne\ntranslation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying\nthe sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of\npublic morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW*\n119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).\n\nSumner did not challenge the ML edition, but *The Decameron* remained a\ncontroversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who\nspecialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML\njacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any\ntitle at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the\nDROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales\nrepresentative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of\ntitles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked\nLewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised:\n“Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern\nmaidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a\nstink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).\n\n*The Decameron* was the best-selling ML title during the first six\nmonths of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nfirst quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position\nin the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower\nthan in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 209.1b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nTHE | DECAMERON | OF | GIOVANNI | BOCCACCIO | TRANSLATED BY | JOHN PAYNE\n| \\[torchbearer D3 at right; 3-line imprint at left\\] THE | MODERN\nLIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xxii, \\[1–2\\] 3–830 \\[831–842\\]. \\[1–27\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 209.1a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] publication and\nmanufacturing statements within single rules; \\[831–836\\] ML list;\n\\[837–838\\] ML Giants list; \\[839–842\\] blank.

Published February 1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.\n\n*Lord Jim* was the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the\nML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML\npaid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\nThe Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included\nCanadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights\nwhen they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers\nwhen they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the\nMacmillan Co. of Canada, sold *Lord Jim* for five months before\nBlackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the\ntransgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped\nselling *Lord Jim* in Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian\nsales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards”\n(Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to\nLongwell, 4 September 1931).\n\n*Lord Jim* sold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant\ntitles. Conrad’s *Victory* (238) sold 7,335 copies during the same\nperiod. Sales of *Lord Jim* totaled 115,000 copies by 1949. By the early\n1950s Conrad was one of the best-selling authors in the ML. *Lord Jim*\nsold 8,669 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952, making it the 11th best-selling title in the regular ML; *Victory*\nwas the 15th best-selling title. *Nostromo* (438), published in November\n1951, appears to have lagged behind Conrad’s other titles; it did not\nrank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML at this period.\n\n#### 210b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nLORD JIM | BY JOSEPH CONRAD | Introduction by <span class=\"smallcaps\">j.\ndonald adams</span> | \\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at\nleft\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPagination and collation as 210a.\n\nContents as 210a except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[ii\\] COPYRIGHT, 1899, 1900, BY\nJOSEPH CONRAD | COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY DOUBLEDAY, DORAN & CO., INC. |\nINTRODUCTION COPYRIGHT, 1931, | BY THE MODERN LIBRARY, INC. *Note:* Fly\ntitle reset.\n\n*Jacket A:* Non-pictorial in grayish blue (186) and dark red (16) on\ncream paper; title and author in dark red on inset cream panel,\nbackground in grayish blue with series and torchbearer in reverse.

New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927\nand reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates.\nPublished March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1978/79.\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was one of the first titles Cerf tried to\nget after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original\nedition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a\nreprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August\n1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint.\nCerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of\nthe original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told\nHoughton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be\ntaken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife,\nHoughton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin\nhad reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It\nwill be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very\nproud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).\n\nHe offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two\ncents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for\nnonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930;\nCerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf\ndid not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the\none-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin\nreduced the advance to $2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s\nto 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received $50 for\nwriting the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).\n\nScaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library\nedition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the\nplates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April\n1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid\n1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.\n\nLater in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of *The\nEducation of Henry Adams* in the format of the new ML Giants series.\nAround the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special\nprinting of Young’s *The Medici* in the same format that had been made\nfor Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of\nthe first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the\npublisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500\neach and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”\n\n*The Education of Henry Adams* was the thirteenth best-selling ML title\nduring the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It\nsold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October\n1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nDuring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed\ninto the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782\ncopies.\n\n#### 211b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nTHE EDUCATION | OF | HENRY ADAMS | BY HENRY ADAMS | INTRODUCTION BY |\nJAMES TRUSLOW ADAMS | \\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at\nleft\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–v\\] vi–x, \\[v\\] vi–x, \\[1–3\\] 4–517 \\[518–528\\].\n\\[1–17\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\nContents as 211a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1918, | BY THE\nMASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY | COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE MODERN\nLIBRARY, INC.; \\[518\\] blank; \\[519–523\\] ML list; \\[524–525\\] ML Giants\nlist; \\[526–528\\] blank.

Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s\nbooks—*The Haunted Bookshop* was also in the Sun Dial Library—and\nsettled on *Parnassus on Wheels*. Publication was announced for August\n1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so\ngreat,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to\nbring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to\nHugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML\nwrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new\nprinting they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had\nbeen sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged\nwith Lippincott.\n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett\nand Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished\nafter the United States entered the Second World War. *Parnassus on\nWheels* sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley\nwas the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling\ntitles—and he had two books in that category. *Human Being* (334), which\nlasted just over five years in the series, outsold *Parnassus on Wheels*\nby nearly 300 copies.\n\n#### 213b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\nPARNASSUS | ON | WHEELS | *by* | Christopher Morley | \\[torchbearer D3\\]\n| \\[rule\\] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPagination as 213a. \\[1–12\\]<sup>8</sup> \\[13\\]<sup>4</sup>\n\nContents as 213a variant except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[*4*\\] COPYRIGHT, 1917,\n1925, BY DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & CO.; \\[191–195\\] ML list; \\[196\\] blank.\n(*Spring 1942*)\n\n*Jacket:* Enlarged version of 213a in light grayish green (154) in place\nof pale purplish blue and with borders omitted.

First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint\ncontract with Knopf in October 1929 for *The Dove’s Nest*, paying a $500\nadvance. *The Garden Party* was not considered because an inexpensive\nreprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML\nbought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to\ncancel the contract for *The Dove’s Nest* so that the ML could include\nthe more popular title. The ML increased the advance to $700 against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The\nroyalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when\nthe ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June\n1947).\n\n*The Garden Party* had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There\nwere printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938,\n1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an\nadditional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies\nduring the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June\n1938). *The Garden Party* sold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles.\nIt was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern\nLibrary during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 214b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\n\\[torchbearer E3\\] | \\[6-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin single rules\\] THE | GARDEN | PARTY | BY | KATHERINE | MANSFIELD\n| \\[below frame\\] MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[*8*\\], 1–255 \\[256–264\\]. \\[1–8\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[9\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 214a except: \\[*2*\\] blank; \\[*4*\\] COPYRIGHT, 1922, BY\nALFRED A.

Discontinued fall\n1946. *The Counterfeiters* with *Journal of the Counterfeiters*\npublished spring 1962 (see 216.2).\n\nCerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition of *The\nCounterfeiters*, offering a $700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a\ncopy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a\ncopy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to $300) was\nintended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf,\n18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x\n4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.\n\nKnopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication\ndate was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the\nfollowing year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s *Lafcadio’s\nAdventures*, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in\nspring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for *The Counterfeiters* (Knopf\nto Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the\nfinal reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably\nsimilar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for\nrenewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep *The\nCounterfeiters* in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any\nspectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to\nKnopf, 24 October 1939).\n\n*The Counterfeiters* sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant sales.\n\n#### 216.1b.** **Title page reset (1941)\n\nThe Counterfeiters | LES FAUX-MONNAYEURS | by André Gide | *Translated\nfrom the French by* DOROTHY BUSSY | *Introduction by* RAYMOND WEAVER |\n\\[torchbearer D1 at right; 3-line imprint at left\\] THE | MODERN LIBRARY\n| NEW YORK | \\[rule\\]\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xx, \\[1–2\\] 3–372 \\[373–380\\]. \\[1–12\\]<sup>16</sup>\n\\[13\\]<sup>8</sup>\n\nContents as 216.1a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] INTRODUCTION COPYRIGHT,\n1931, | BY THE MODERN LIBRARY, INC. | COPYRIGHT, 1927, BY ALFRED A.\nKNOPF, INC.; \\[373–377\\] ML list; \\[378–380\\] blank.

Discontinued fall 1935.\n\nThe ML paid Viking an $800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy.\nThe ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large\nfor its format.\n\nSales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other\nadvance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six\nmonths of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to\ncompetition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger\nthan the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in\n1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches\ntaller than the ML edition.\n\nThe ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press\nowned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act\nrestricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the\nU.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine*\nirretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the\nunauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold\nGuinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be\nmade. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and\nwould not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf\nsuggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was\nentirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance\nhad been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton\ntranslation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s\nshoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates\n(Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates,\nand Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold\ncopies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).\n\n***Fall***"

(*Spring\n> 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published\nSeptember 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies.\nDiscontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.\n\nWilla Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to\ninclude in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright.\nCerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s *My\nÁntonia* or *The Song of the Lark*, offering royalties of eight cents a\ncopy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who\nwas then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they\napproached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of *Death Comes for the\nArchbishop*, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf a $4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy.\nThe advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh\nEayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML\nprintings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies\n(December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934),\n5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the\nML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows:\n14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910\ncopies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nAfter the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want\nany of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked\nKnopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of\nthe contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock\nafter the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf,\nindicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September\n25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:\n\n> In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so\n> much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do\n> is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH\n> COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It\n> seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather,\n> and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep\n> the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will\n> undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other\n> alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th\n> of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would\n> probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder\n> price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell\n> out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the\n> book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the\n> most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the\n> contract?\n>\n> . . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give\n> up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett\n> and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to\n> renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss\n> Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to\n> say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).\n\nKnopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from\nher point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June\n1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. *Death*\n*Comes* *for* *the* *Archbishop* was listed in the ML’s spring 1937\ncatalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to\nEayrs, 28 May 1937).\n\nIn 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had\nacquired Alfred A.

(*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916. ML edition\nprinted from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new\ntypesetting. Published November 1931. *WR* 5 December 1931. First\nprinting: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.\n\nCerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in\nJanuary 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly\ninterested in *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, but McFee appears to have\nbeen opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf\ninvited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s *Purple Land* (134)\nand indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the\npossibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26\nAugust 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels,\n*Casuals of the Sea* and *Command*, were in the Sun Dial Library, which\nthe ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday\nreprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both\nnovels, but in the end only *Casuals of the Sea* was added.\n\nMorley’s introduction to *Casuals of the Sea* was originally for the\nLambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.\n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when\nthere was a printing of 1,000 copies.\n\n*Casuals of the Sea* sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945.\nIt was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during\nthe twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\nWhen Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition of *Command* in 1933, Cerf\nresponded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book,\nbut \\[it\\] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished\nsomewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de\nGraff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In\n1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in *Casuals of the Sea* to\nMcFee and sold him the plates for $70. The ML signed a new contract with\nMcFee and paid him $70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to\nbe applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the\nplates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).\n\n#### 223b.** **Title page reset (c. 1940)\n\n\\[torchbearer E3\\] | \\[7-line title and statement of responsibility\nwithin single rules\\] CASUALS | OF | THE SEA | BY | WILLIAM M<span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">c</span>FEE | WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY | CHRISTOPHER\nMORLEY | \\[below frame\\] THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK\n\nPp. \\[i–vi\\] vii–xvi \\[xvii–xviii\\], \\[1–2\\] 3–513 \\[514–518\\].\n\\[1–16\\]<sup>16</sup> \\[17\\]<sup>12</sup>\n\nContents as 223a except: \\[ii\\] blank; \\[iv\\] COPYRIGHT, 1931, BY THE\nMODERN LIBRARY, INC.; \\[514–518\\] blank.

The terms of the final contract have\nnot been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12\ncents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the\nend the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular\nprinters.\n\nSales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883\ncopies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies\n(1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).\n\nKnopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year\nterm. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will\nbe a $3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more\nrevenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have\nthe book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada,\n18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in\nOctober 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint\ncontract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a\nlarge final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his\nappreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your\nattitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot\nof things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf\nto Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.\n\nCerf never accepted the loss of *The Magic Mountain* and tried\nrepeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical.\nIn 1942, after Mann’s *Buddenbrooks* (285) had also been withdrawn from\nthe ML, Cerf offered a $5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a\ncopy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you”\nfor permission to publish *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant. He added,\n“Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know\nwhy this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back\nthan any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July\n1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is\njust too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on\nany arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the\nnecessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied:\n“I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC\nMOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow\n*Buddenbrooks* into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann\ntitle somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent\nthe best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).\n\n*The Magic Mountain* was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s\nacquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML\nin 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMann, *Buddenbrooks* (1935–1940) 285\n\nMann, Thomas, *Stories of Three Decades* (Giant, 1961–1973; 1979–1986)\nG97\n\nMann, *Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man* (1965–1971) 577\n\nMann, *Doctor Faustus* (1966– ) 582"

His *Sister Carrie* pointed the\n> tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it\n> remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy,\n> tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown\n> internationally famous. (*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired\nthe Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W.\nDodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and\nBoni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. \\[*1*\\]–557) printed from\nDreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nDreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The\nEarly Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it\nwas rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday,\nPage at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a\nreader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:\n\n> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its\n> frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and\n> because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be\n> withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in\n> circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that\n> the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to\n> insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal\n> adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his\n> share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was\n> legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a\n> contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include\n> *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in\n> the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because\n> no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did\n> manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred\n> of them. (p. vi)\n\n[James L. W. West\nIII](http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html)\nnotes:\n\n> Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a\n> vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read\n> the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For\n> whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the\n> narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish\n> it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw\n> the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication.\n> Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed\n> to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no\n> obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and\n> Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of\n> Pennsylvania Library, 2000).\n\nDoubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450\nunbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456\ncopies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and\nDreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates\nthat the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies\nof *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &\nCompany (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later\npurchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister\nCarrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.\n\nThe ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a\n$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the\nadvance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates\nwhich had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited\nto Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML\nedition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.\nDreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing\nwas required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions\nfor the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s\ndeath the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser\nPapers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).\n\nDreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was\noriginally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s\nNote on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:\n\n> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern\n> Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as\n> much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and\n> spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser,\n> however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements\n> covering the two-fifty edition \\[the trade edition published by Boni &\n> Liveright in 1917\\], and it was only in February, 1932, after more\n> attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us\n> do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.\n\n*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the\n1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies\nby the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of\n$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies\nduring the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in\nthe first quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n**230b.

(*Fall 1931*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9\nApril 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. *The Stories of Anton\nTchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories*\n(27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision\nof the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been\nawaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short\nStories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to\nscrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection\nthat we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected\nwith due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the\nfourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s\ncollection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).\n\nThe ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the\nspelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use\nof “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton\nTchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of\nthat spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to\n“Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.\n\n*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.

Published March 1932. *WR*\n26 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\nPublished in Vintage Books, spring 1967.\n\nCerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the\nML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your\nModern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to\ntake with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE\nFURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the\ntime the book was published, in your list \\[Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,\n*On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,* was published by Cape &\nSmith in 1929\\]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will\nbe a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us\nup.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few\nvolumes. He requested Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*\nand any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books\nin which a Dostoyefsky \\[*sic*\\] influence was found. I have never read\nDostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf,\n15 April 1931).\n\nCerf and Klopfer wanted to include *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay\nDying*, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type\nwhich had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s\naudience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the\ncost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in\nproduction and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House\nbetween 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for\nbooks without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was\ncheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the\npossibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year\nor so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be\ninstructed to melt the type (Harter, *The Making of William Faulkner’s\nBooks, 1929*–*1939*, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult\nfor reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive\nreprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial\npublication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from\nthe original publisher’s plates.\n\nFaulkner’s next book, *Sanctuary*, had more commercial appeal. It was\nthe only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were\nmade. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback.\nThe American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet\nBooks—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight\nprintings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies\n(Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on\nfront cover).\n\nIn his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he\ninitially wrote *Sanctuary* for money. The introduction begins:\n\n> This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea,\n> because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been\n> writing books for about five years, which got published but not\n> bought. . . .\n>\n> Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in\n> terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of\n> it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in\n> Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought\n> was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could\n> imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)\n\nAfter sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job\nworking the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between\n12 and 4, I wrote *As I Lay Dying* in six weeks, without changing a\nword. I sent it to Smith \\[his publisher\\] and wrote him that by it I\nwould stand or fall.” He continues:\n\n> I think I had forgotten about *Sanctuary*, just as you might forget\n> about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off.\n> *As I Lay Dying* was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of\n> *Sanctuary* until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so\n> terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite\n> it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy\n> it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been\n> already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting\n> it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame *The\n> Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* too much and I made a fair\n> job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they\n> will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)\n\nFaulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than\nthe rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be\nreset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees\nBook Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the\nintroduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like\nBurck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when\nE. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger\nformat.\n\nFaulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith &\nHaas. *Sanctuary* remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published together\nin a single volume.\n\n*Sanctuary* sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nFaulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel\nPrize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the\nseries. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in\nterms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952. *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was the fifth\nbest-selling title in the regular ML, followed by *Light in August*\n(429), *Absalom, Absalom!* (434), and *Sanctuary* (233), which sold\n4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in\nthe regular ML.\n\n#### 233.1b.

Introductions appear to\nhave been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in\nuniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of\nthe uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By\n1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform\njackets. Four, including *Sanctuary*, were existing ML titles that were\noutfitted in new jackets. Four titles—*Selected Short Stories*,\n*Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and *Pylon*—were new to the series.\n*The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, had previously been\ncombined in a single ML volume."

Now it is\n> acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last\n> decade of the nineteenth century.

Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular\nML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format,\n1979–86.\n\nWhen plans were made to publish *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* in MLCE,\nStein offered Weber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30\nJune 1950). Weber accepted but added:\n\n> I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of\n> this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first\n> issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED\n> BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an\n> edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier\n> editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s\n> “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent\n> reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text\n> for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what,\n> please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are\n> going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of\n> Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a\n> definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).\n\nStein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920\nedition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport,\nTennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty\nof 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML\nformat, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer.\nThe ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the\nHarper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950).\nThe map was included at Weber’s suggestion.\n\n#### 234.2b.

Such\n> poems as “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” “The Courtship of Miles\n> Standish,” “Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and many others are part of our\n> heritage, and we read them over and over again with a nostalgia for\n> our youth and a new appreciation of Longfellow’s place among the great\n> lyricists of our national literature. (*Spring 1938*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nLongfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his\ntime. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when\nLongfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes\nsubstantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at\nHarvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death\nhe received $4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice\nwhat he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained\nsufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin\nCo., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher,\nTicknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced\nits edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott\nat Houghton Mifflin:\n\n> A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we\n> first noticed your announcement . . . \\[Longfellow is the\\] Poet of\n> Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled\n> at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and\n> office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”\n\nLinscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for\nwhich the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy\nacknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).\n\nThe ML initially intended to base its edition on *The Poems of Henry W.\nLongfellow*, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library\nseries. Linscott wrote again four days later:\n\n> You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow”\n> which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright\n> before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents\n> as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and\n> a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19\n> January 1932).\n\nLinscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete\nCambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.\n\nAt this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton\nMifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant\nfigure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537),\nintervened. He wrote Cerf:\n\n> I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it \\[the\n> Longfellow matter\\]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow\n> material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that\n> poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and\n> have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal\n> relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have\n> tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters.\n>\n> Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library\n> cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, *et cetera*, or can\n> you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I\n> believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February\n> 1932)\n\nBoth Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of\nLongfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to\nLinscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932).\nLinscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may\nhave gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the\ncircumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at\npresent” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).\n\nIn the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the\ncopyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include\nnearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.\n\nWhen the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who\nacknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best\nwishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML\nedition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a\nnew typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that\nhad entered the public domain since 1932.\n\n*The Poems of Longfellow* and *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*\n(236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic\njacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets\nby 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and\nFranklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by\na pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for *The Poems of\nLongfellow* remained in use until the early 1940s.\n\nCerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s,\nbut it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. *The Poems\nof Longfellow* sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed\nservices. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on\nto its first-quarter ranking.\n\n#### 235.1b.

Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nCerf originally planned to publish Franklin’s *Autobiography* by itself.\nThree months before publication he decided to add more of Franklin’s\nwritings so the book would be a better value. Goodman, who suggested the\nadditional contents, received $100 for his work on the volume.\n\n*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* and *The Poems of Longfellow*\n(235) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic\njacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets\nby 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and\nLongfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from\nthis day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press\nunless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both\nthe typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think\nthat the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to\nWilliam Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).\n\nThe Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed\npictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first\nprinting are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained\nin use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive\njackets the ML ever used.\n\n*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* sold 5,569 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the\nsecond quarter of ML and Giant titles.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp.\n\\[v–vii\\], \\[1\\]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half\ntitle used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.\n\nThe ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf\ninitially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf\nto Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may\nhave been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931\npublication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford\nin Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and\nindicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January\n1932).\n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies\n(July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March\n1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling\n14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111\ncopies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf\nto Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *A Farewell to Arms* sold 12,287\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing\nit sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of *The Sun\nAlso Rises*. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of\nthe Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf,\n29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *A Farewell to\nArms* was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nedition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.\n\n#### 237b.

(*Fall 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1915. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new Doubleday, Doran typesetting; the\nplates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published June\n1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nCerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to *Victory*.\nIn 1928 he offered an advance of $3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a\nroyalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to\nNelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do\nappreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is\nunwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21\nDecember 1928). *Victory* was included in the Sun Dial Library published\nby Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that\nspecialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial\nLibrary in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title\nincluded in the series. *Victory* was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial\nLibrary titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\n*Victory* sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Lord Jim* (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales\nof *Victory* totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad\nwas one of the ML’s best-selling authors. *Victory* sold 7,966 copies\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the\ntwelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. *Lord Jim* was the eighth\nbest-selling title.\n\n#### 238b.

(*Spring 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros.,\n1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July\n1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1958.\n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated\ninterest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his\npersonal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself\nhave bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros.,\n5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk\nabout a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September\n1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he\nstated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in\nthe Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and\nI have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the\nauthor’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint\ncontract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a\nwarm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the\nModern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is\nreleased” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).\n\nWhen the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed\nKlopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the\nReaders Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s\npresident, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was\navailable (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and\nconvinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail\norder sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would\nlike to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the\noption to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer\nto Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty\nremained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed\nin 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but\nwithout an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the\nML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club\nedition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).\n\nIn 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in\nadding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349)\nto the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper\ndirector of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the\nML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had\ntextbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer\nreplied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition\nfrom an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department\nwants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the\nModern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to\nRose, 25 July 1956).\n\n*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles\nin the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952.\n\n#### 239b.

The statement on\nthe title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not\nstrictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation\nof “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and\nunabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the\nstories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional\nphrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I\nbelieve it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”\n(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML\nmade three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to\nWalter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the\nbook for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in\nSeptember 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition\nin November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap\nborrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,\npaying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).\n\n*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.

His *Capital and Other Writings*, judiciously and\n> discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a\n> newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the\n> shelf of the Modern Library. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of *Capital*\nand Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint\nof *The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of\n“Capital,”* edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L.\nTrask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML\nedition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until\nOctober because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S.\nThe ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L.\nTrask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and\nit seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic\ntheories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is\nusually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and\n*Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.\n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was\nprominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was\ncompiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy\nencyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of\nMarx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932).\nCerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his\nname may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he\nwould cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The\nLenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent\nParts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally\nprojected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an\nintroduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a\nRussian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by\nLenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark\nmade by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something\ncomplete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this\ntheory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must\nadvance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p.\nxix).\n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and\nOther Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of\nLenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and\nedit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was\ncancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested,\nDeclined” under 1933 for more information.\n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack\nof an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*:\n“I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an\nindex. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which\nKarl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember\nyour obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not\nGroucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that\nSchuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to\nSchuster, 8 February 1933).\n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist\nManifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952\nwith sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The\nCommunist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in\nthe past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).\n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s\n*Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333\ncopies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.\n\n#### 246b.

Only a few\n> books have survived. Of these, *Three Soldiers* stands pre-eminent. It\n> reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the\n> experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture\n> in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. *Three\n> Soldiers* introduced a writer who has since become a major figure\n> among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests\n> securely. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed\nfrom Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates\nappear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled\nfor November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1963.\n\nEight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday,\nDoran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern\nLibrary, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and\nThree Soldiers.” He asked how many copies *Three Soldiers* had sold in\nthe trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial\nLibrary (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that\nthe plates for *Three Soldiers* were too large for the ML’s format he\ncontacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer* and *The 42nd Parallel*. *Manhattan Transfer* had\nsold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for *The 42nd Parallel* (Henry\nHoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those\ntitles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin\nwith *Three Soldiers* and added *The 42nd Parallel* (307) to the ML five\nyears later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos\nPassos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.\n\nFor *Three Soldiers* the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his\ncorrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know\nif I made more corrections in the *Three Soldiers* text than you can\nhandle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were\njust going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was\naway when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked\nCerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling\ncorrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.\nThe introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was\ndoing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,\nundated).\n\n*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from\nDoubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500\ncopies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20\nAugust 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\nHoughton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.*\n(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality\npaperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination\nagreement in June and instructed the production department to make no\nmore printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June\n1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock\nand asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to\nbring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick\nMoseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated\nthat the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a\nyear, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley,\n22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if\n*Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was\n(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January\n1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that\nyear.\n\n*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after\nfall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the\nend of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The\nBuddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring\n1969 after the oversight was discovered.\n\n#### 248b.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations.\n> Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second\n> only to the furore created by his own *Trilby*.

In its original form, it remains a book\n> of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (*Spring 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1891. New\nbibliographical edition published by Harper & Brothers with a 1919\ncopyright date; the new edition was probably published in the 1920s. ML\nedition (pp. \\[ii\\], v–vii, \\[1\\]–416) printed from plates of the later\nHarper edition. Published December 1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First\nprinting: 7,450 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.\n\nThe royalties that the ML paid to Harper & Brothers were based on sales,\nin contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number\nof copies printed. *Peter Ibbetson* was one of the few books in the ML\nprinted on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary\nbecause of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first\nprinting may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing\nof 8,000 copies and received 7,450.\n\nWhen the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s\nthat it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations\nand asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper &\nBros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the\nwood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the\nplates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s\nballoon-cloth format.\n\n*Peter Ibbetson* sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles.

Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1937; unsigned. Front flap as\njacket A. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nCarlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by\nJ. M. Dent & Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December\n1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and\nsubsequently in Vintage Books.\n\nThe ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of\nreports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from\nHenry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the\ntranslation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice\nFiruski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the\ntranslation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by\nT. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber $60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on\nDante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent\nof Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski,\n28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering $75 for an\nintroduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to\nGrandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.\n\nCerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few\nparagraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932).\nGrandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using\nand knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the\nbest translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher\n(Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an\ninferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the\nTemple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph\nby the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of\nthe English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle,\nThomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is\nclear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be\nreadily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its\nscholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p.\nxiii).\n\nThe Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s\n*Divine Comedy* the best translations have been followed: *Inferno*, by\nJohn Aiken Carlyle; *Purgatorio*, by Thomas Okey; *Paradisio*, by Philip\nH. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim)\nfollow, in the main, the excellent notes for the *Inferno* and the\n*Purgatorio* by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr.\nOeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the *Paradisio*” (251.1, p. 3;\n251.2, p. xvii).\n\nML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to\nthe translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the\ntranslator of *Purgatorio*. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library\n(IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations\nwere not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML\nprintings until 1963/64 (251.2c).\n\nShortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S.\nSingleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of\n*The Divine Comedy* for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working\non a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled\nto be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the\nseven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the\napproval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after\ntheirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances\ntotaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took\nlonger than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years\nlater it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The\nBollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and\n1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary.\nBy that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become\nmoribund and had ceased adding new titles.\n\n*The Divine Comedy* sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant\ntitles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 251.1b.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The modern point of view, contemptuous of all the old canons of\n> Victorian morality, beauty and love, is nowhere more brilliantly\n> championed than in the novels of Aldous Huxley. Full of shrewd\n> commentaries and stinging humor, his books are extravaganzas that\n> satirize the world of today. The two novels by which he is best known,\n> *Point Counter Point* (No. 180) and *Antic Hay*, are in the same\n> temper. Both are as sophisticated as the age they reflect. *Antic Hay*\n> is a novel for the enlightened modern. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by George H. Doran Co., 1923. ML edition\n(252.1, pp. 7–350) printed from Doubleday, Doran plates. Published\nJanuary 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing: 6,000 copies.\n\nThe ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf invited\nLewis Gannett to write an introduction to a forthcoming ML title of his\nchoice. He selected *Antic Hay* as the most appealing but was\ndisappointed with the $50 fee; he had assumed the ML paid more.\n\n*Antic Hay* sold 3,427 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203) sold 7,733 copies—more than\ntwice as many as *Antic Hay*—during the same period. *Antic Hay* was not\namong the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\nDoubleday, Doran sold its plates and publishing rights to Huxley’s older\nbooks to Harper & Bros. in 1939. Harper’s considered withdrawing *Antic\nHay* and *Point Counter Point* from the ML, but Klopfer was able to\nnegotiate new reprint contracts (see 203). New five-year contracts for\nthe books were sent to Harper’s on 30 March 1939. The *Antic Hay*\ncontract called for the ML to pay a $500 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy and included a special clause that allowed Harper’s to\ncancel the contract if the ML could not undertake a reprint of at least\n2,500 copies after three years.\n\n#### 252.1b.

(*Fall 1932*)\n\nA. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,\n1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American\nbranch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made\nfrom a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively\nby the ML. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing:\n6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.\n\nThe original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.\nFor its edition of France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163), published in\n1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off\nthe running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the\nheadline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was\none of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf\nconsidered doing the same for *Penguin Island* (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4\nNovember 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The\nresult was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages\nshorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.\n\nThe ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the\ntranslator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years\nafter the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of\nthe title page of 253c, published in 1984.\n\nThe ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s\n(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)\nbut picked up in the 1940s. *Penguin Island* sold 4,876 copies during\nthe eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\nThe publication of *Penguin Island* brought the number of France’s works\nin the ML to five. *The Queen* *Pédauque* was discontinued at the end of\n1933; by the end of 1942 *Penguin Island* was the only title by France\nin the series.\n\n#### 253b.

Publication of\nthe ML edition came two years after the release of John Ford’s film\nversion starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes and coincided with the\nappearance of Lewis’s new novel *Ann Vickers.* The ML urged booksellers\nto feature the two books together in window displays (ML advertisement,\n*PW*, 14 January 1933, p. 98).\n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy. Harcourt, Brace secured the approval of Grosset & Dunlap,\nwhich also published a reprint edition printed from Harcourt, Brace\nplates, before authorizing the ML reprint. A later reprint from the\noriginal Harcourt, Brace plates was published by P. F. Collier & Son.\n\n*Arrowsmith* sold 5,646 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\nSales improved dramatically by the early 1950s. It sold 7,919 copies\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making\n*Arrowsmith* the thirteenth best-selling title in the regular ML, 153\ncopies ahead of Hemingway, *A Farewell to Arms*.\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning college\nmarket. Harcourt, Brace served notice that it was terminating the ML’s\nreprint contracts for *Arrowsmith*, Lewis’s *Babbitt*, and seven other\ntitles, including works by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne Porter, Lytton\nStrachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML,\n18 May 1948). The ML’s contract for *Arrowsmith* had four years to run.\nHarcourt, Brace confirmed its termination in 1952, noting that the\nfirm’s College Dept. wanted exclusive rights for a few years (S.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1933. *WR* 29 April 1933. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by *Great German Short Novels\nand Stories*, ed. Victor Lange (451).\n\nThomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology\nof German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February\n1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed\nresponsibility for the anthology:\n\nIt was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a\nconsiderable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He\nexpressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract\nwas duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still\nroaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled.\nAt long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German\nauthors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with\nthe job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to\ngather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and\nexercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to\nthe publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the\nwastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)\n\nHitler came to power shortly before *Great German Short Novels and\nStories* was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the\nvolume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf,\n17 April 1933).\n\nWhen *Great German Short Novels and Stories* was being planned Cerf\ncontacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s *Death in Venice*,\noffering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a\nThomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been\npublished in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf\nhad published Kenneth Burke’s translation of *Death in Venice* as a\nseparate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T.\nLowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the\nout-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against\nroyalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.\n\n*Great German Short Novels and Stories* sold 4,450 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of\nthe second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n#### 256b.

RH subsequently became\nStein’s regular publisher, and a warm friendship developed between Cerf\nand Stein.\n\nThe ML acquired the plates and full publishing rights to *Three Lives*,\nand Van Vechten wrote a new introduction for the ML edition. Cerf\ninformed Stein a month after publication that “the book is proving to be\na tremendous success for us. It is causing more comment than any new\nModern Library title in the past two years. The firm of R. H. Macy &\nCo., which has probably the largest book department in the world today,\nhas bought the astonishing number of 1300 copies of this little book\nsince publication day less than a month ago.

Cerf persuaded James Laughlin of\nNew Directions to add *Three Lives* to their New Classics series in\n1941. New Directions used the ML’s plates, including Van Vechten’s\nintroduction, and paid the ML a $250 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy.

The advance was reduced to $1,000 in the\ncontract dated 17 May 1933. The small type and dated nineteenth-century\ntypography of the “Player’s Edition” plates made *Ben-Hur* one of the\nleast attractive volumes in the series.

Boni needed cash but feared that sales of the complete set of\n*Remembrance of Things Past* would be undermined if individual volumes\nappeared in the ML too rapidly.

The reprint contract was finally signed late the following year\nand specified that the ML edition could not be published before October\n1933.

Discontinued fall 1970.\n\nThe ML could not expect to secure exclusive reprint rights to a major\nbest-seller like *The Good Earth*, which headed the best-seller list for\ntwo years (1931–32). Grosset & Dunlap, the leading mass-market publisher\nof hardbound reprint editions, recognized that there was little overlap\nbetween its market and the ML’s and sometimes agreed to share reprint\nrights. When Cerf contacted the John Day Co. at the beginning of 1933\nabout a ML edition of *The Good Earth*, he was told that it would be\nmany months before a commitment about reprint rights could be made (Cerf\nto Richard Walsh, John Day Co., 3 January 1933; Walsh to Cerf, 4 January\n1933). Arrangements were made later that year for *The Good Earth* to\nappear first in Grosset & Dunlap’s Novels of Distinction series and\nshortly thereafter in the ML.\n\nBuck’s introduction to the ML edition (266.1) is a reprint of a long\nletter that was originally published under the title “Mrs. Buck Replies\nto Her Chinese Critic” in the *New York Times Book Review* (15 January\n1933).\n\nThree months after Pocket Books published *The Good Earth* as a\ntwenty-five-cent paperback, Cerf commented, “I think the sale of this\nbook holds up amazingly well in our edition when you consider how many\nother editions it comes in, and we are certainly proud to have it in our\nModern Library list” (Cerf to Walsh, 30 November 1939). Comparative\nsales figures for the Grosset & Dunlap, ML, and John Day editions for\nthe eighteen-month period July 1938–December 1939 show the following:\nGrosset & Dunlap, 24,081 copies; ML, 3,133 copies; Day, 443 copies (RH\nbox 141, folder D1).\n\nSales of the ML edition more than doubled during the Second World War,\nreflecting the heightened demand for books in wartime and enhanced\ninterest in China. The ML edition sold 7,383 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n*The Good Earth* was shifted from ML 2 to ML 15 in fall 1943 when the ML\npublished its three-volume Shakespeare as ML 1–3.\n\nThe ML’s reprint contract for *The Good Earth* was terminated in July\n1966, shortly after the ML ordered a final printing of 5,000 copies.\nTogether with 1,600 copies already on hand, it was estimated that the ML\nstock would last for at least one-and-a-half years.\n\n#### 266.1b.

Signed: WC.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The selection of a detective story for inclusion in the Modern Library\n> series provided an embarrassment of riches. Yet there was neither\n> hesitation nor reservation in the choice of *The Maltese Falcon*. Its\n> authentic portrayal of the folkways of hard-bitten criminals and\n> sleuths, its mystifying plot and its rogues’ gallery of shady and\n> picturesque characters set it apart from all the neatly contrived and\n> resolutely erudite standard shockers. Carl Van Vechten says: “Dashiell\n> Hammett has raised the detective story to that plane to which\n> Alexandre Dumas raised the historical novel.” (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published in book form by Alfred A. Knopf, 1930. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\], \\[xi\\]–267) printed from Knopf plates. Published March 1934.\n*WR* 31 March 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall\n1949.\n\nHammett’s original introduction to the ML edition describes the people\nwho served as models for many of the characters. “Spade,” he notes, “had\nno original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the\nprivate detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite\na few of them in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your\nprivate detective does not—or did not ten years ago when he was my\ncolleague—want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes\nmanner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of\nhimself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in\ncontact with, whether criminal, innocent bystander or client” (pp.\nviii–ix).\n\n*The Maltese Falcon* was originally published as a five-part serial\n(September 1929–January 1930) in the pulp magazine *Black Mask*. “The\nbook was dramatically revised after serialization, with more than two\nthousand textual differences between the two versions. Some of the\nchanges were made by copy editors at Knopf but the majority appear to\nhave been made by Hammett himself” (Penzler, p. 105).\n\nThere were six Knopf printings between February and November 1930 and\nfifteen ML printings between February 1934 and August 1943 (*The Maltese\nFalcon*, Pocket Books edition, second printing, November 1944, title\npage verso). The sixth ML printing (January 1940) was probably the first\nin the larger ML format (267b), but a copy of this printing has not been\nexamined.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,254 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. The October 1941 release of John Huston’s motion picture version\nstarring Humphrey Bogart may have stimulated ML sales at this period.\nThe 25-cent paperback published by Pocket Books in August 1944 appears\nto have cut deeply into the ML’s market. The ML edition was discontinued\nin 1949, leaving 6,200 unsold copies in stock (Emanuel Harper to Joseph\nC. Lesser, Knopf, 1 June 1950). The ML remaindered 4,774 copies through\nthe Harlem Book Co in 1952.\n\n#### 267b.

Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of *God’s\n> Little Acre* on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and\n> women in public life rallied to its support.

(*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp.\n\\[v\\], \\[1\\]–\\[311\\]) printed from Viking plates, which were\nsubsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown & Co.\nPublished April 1934. *WR* 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1970/71.\n\nCaldwell received $50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf\nto Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:\n\n> Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have\n> the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have\n> mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly\n> trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and\n> girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee\n> winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills\n> of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them.\n> I hope so. (p. ix)\n\nThe hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition\nwas realized most fully after the introduction of mass market\npaperbacks. The paperback edition of *God’s Little Acre*, published in\n1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by\nPenguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its\nfirst nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern\npaperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million\ncopies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).\n\nThe biographical note and bibliography on p. \\[vi\\] were updated at\nCaldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27\nDecember 1938). The plates and publishing rights to *God’s Little Acre*\nwere transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall\n1939 and passed to Little, Brown & Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged\nits printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one\nprinting under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted\nthat the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934\nand inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill,\nLittle, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying\nroyalties of 12 cents a copy.\n\nThe ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total\nsales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to\nJames Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).\n\n#### 268.1b.

(*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1919. ML edition (pp.\n\\[iii–iv\\], \\[xiii\\]–368) printed from McBride plates with the expanded\nforeword first included in the eighth McBride printing. Published July\n1934. *WR* 28 July 1934. Discontinued fall 1943.\n\n*Jurgen* was one of the first titles Cerf and Klopfer tried to secure\nafter they bought the ML in the summer of 1925. Cerf offered McBride a\n$5,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy; as a second choice\nhe offered 8 cents a copy for either Cabell’s *Cream of the Jest* or\n*The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck* (Cerf to Mr. \\[Guy\\] Holt, McBride, 29\nJuly 1925). McBride had authorized a ML edition of *Beyond Life* (104)\ntwo years before but in 1925 was unwilling to consider further reprint\neditions of Cabell’s books. Sales of the original editions remained\nstrong, and McBride was thinking about publishing its own cheap edition\nof Cabell’s works (Holt to Cerf, 24 August 1925).\n\nMcBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the Jest* (131) in\n1927. The following year Klopfer made another offer for *Jurgen*, but\nthe response was still negative, even after he increased the offer to 12\ncents a copy. Stuart Rose of McBride wrote that the firm “is loathe to\npermit any further reprints of Mr. Cabell’s works to appear, at least\nfor the time being. . . . The sales of all of Mr. Cabell’s books, and\nparticularly of JURGEN, in the two dollar and fifty cent edition, are so\nprofitable to us that we hesitate to risk decreasing them in any way –\nthis despite the fact that we have not noticed any falling off in the\nsale of THE CREAM OF THE JEST” (Rose to Klopfer, 26 March 1928; Klopfer\nto Rose, 27 March 1928).\n\nGrosset & Dunlap published a reprint edition of *Jurgen* in its Novels\nof Distinction series in 1929. When Cerf expressed interest in\npublishing *Jurgen* in the ML in fall 1933 (Cerf to Stanley Walker,\nMcBride, 23 December 1932), McBride indicated that it could be discussed\nwhen the Grosset & Dunlap contract expired. Cerf wrote a few months\nlater, “I hope you will bear in mind that we want this book whenever we\ncan get it” (Cerf to Walker, 15 May 1933). He then turned to Grosset &\nDunlap and secured its support for a ML edition. Grosset & Dunlap wrote\nMcBride on the ML’s behalf, indicating that “the Modern Library isn’t\ndirectly competitive with our Dollar line” (Grosset & Dunlap to McBride\n& Co., 16 November 1933).\n\n#### 271b.

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1903. New bibliographical\nedition with the Tompkins foreword published by Doubleday, Doran & Co.,\n1928, as part of the 10-volume Argonaut edition of Norris’s works. ML\nedition (pp. \\[v\\]–403) printed from offset plates photographically\nreduced from the Argonaut edition. Published August 1934. *WR* 25 August\n1934. First (and probably only) printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n31 December 1940.\n\nRobert de Graff of Garden City Publishing Co., a Doubleday subsidiary,\nwas inspired by Ernest Peixotto’s article on Norris in *Saturday Review\nof Literature* (27 May 1933) to suggest that Norris belonged in the ML\n(de Graff to Cerf, 29 May 1933). Sinclair Lewis had suggested a ML\nedition of Norris’s *McTeague* or *The* *Octopus* three years earlier\n(Lewis to Cerf, 14 March 1930). Cerf expressed interest, and de Graff\nsent copies of *The Pit* and *McTeague* for his consideration. He noted\nthat *The Pit* had sold 189,455 copies in all editions while *McTeague*\nhad sold 67,272 copies and *The Octopus* had sold 59,779 copies (de\nGraff to Cerf, 14 July 1933). On this basis Cerf decided that *The Pit*\n“should certainly be the one for us to take” (Cerf to de Graff, 24 July\n1933). He appears to have been unaware that *McTeague* (57) was in the\nML between 1918 and 1922 but had been discontinued before he joined Boni\n& Liveright as a vice-president in 1923.\n\nThe plates of the 1903 Doubleday edition of *The Pit* were too large for\nthe ML’s format, and Cerf initially assumed that the ML edition would\nhave to be printed from a new typesetting. He hoped that Doubleday would\nshare the cost and asked de Graff, “Can we make some deal, do you think,\nmaking some special provision for the cost of the plates?” (ibid.).\nMeanwhile, Klopfer investigated the possibility of adapting the original\nplates. He wrote to the ML’s printer: “We might put the book in the\nModern Library by chopping off the running head and putting the folios\nin small numbers at the bottom of each page. The plates are in pretty\nbad shape, and I would like you to look them over and see whether you\nthink, with a reasonable amount of repair work, you could make a decent\nlooking book out of them” (Klopfer to William Simon, Parkway Printing\nCo., 29 August 1933).\n\nPublication of the ML edition was announced for May 1934 but postponed\nuntil August; Dickens’s *David Copperfield* (269), originally scheduled\nfor August, was moved forward to May. Uncertainty over production of\n*The Pit* appears to have caused the delay. Klopfer indicated at the end\nof April, “I am still not sure what method of printing we are going to\nuse” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, 30 April 1934). In the end a decision was\nmade to print from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1928\nArgonaut edition. *The Pit* appears to have been the first ML title\nprinted by offset lithography. Offset lithography was more expensive\nthan letterpress printing at this period and the quality was poorer, but\nit would have been considerably more expensive to reset the work and\nmake new letterpress plates.\n\nSales of the ML edition appear to have been disappointing. *The Pit* was\ndiscontinued after less than six-and-a-half years. Copies of the first\nML printing have been seen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on\nthe endpaper.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nNorris, *McTeague* (1918–1922) 57"

It is by all odds Scott\n> Fitzgerald’s best book, and one that nobody interested in the\n> development of American literature can afford to overlook. (*Fall\n> 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1925. ML edition (pp.\n\\[xiii\\]–218) printed from Scribner plates. Published September 1934.\n*WR* 29 September 1934. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nMaxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald’s editor at Scribner’s, suggested a ML\nedition of *The Great Gatsby*. He wrote to Cerf (25 October 1933) to\nannounce the forthcoming publication of *Tender Is the Night*, which\nappeared initially as a serial in *Scribner’s Magazine*, and added: “If\nit goes, and the first installment appears in the January number, why\ndon’t you consider issuing ‘The Great Gatsby’ with an introduction by\nGertrude Stein?” (Stein was an early supporter of *The Great Gatsby* and\nwrote Fitzgerald shortly after publication of the “genuine pleasure” it\nhad brought her, calling it “a good book” and commenting that he was\n“creating the contemporary world as much as Thackeray did his”; see\nTanselle and Bryer, p. 410). Four months later Cerf wrote that he wanted\nto publish a ML edition in fall 1934. He offered a $500 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he would pay Fitzgerald\n$50 for a new introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 27 February 1934).\nIncluding his share of the advance, Fitzgerald received a total of $300\nfrom the ML edition.\n\nFitzgerald was “evidently quite pleased that this book is to go into our\nseries” and telephoned long distance from Baltimore to talk with Cerf\nabout the introduction (Cerf to Perkins, 6 March 1934). He put off\nwriting it, however. After Klopfer wrote on 1 August to remind him of\nthe approaching publication date he promised to submit it within a week.\nHe appears to have met this deadline, and Klopfer sent him galley proofs\nof the introduction on 17 August. Shortly after Fitzgerald submitted the\ncorrected proofs, he indicated that he was not satisfied with the\nintroduction and asked for the proofs back (Myers, pp. 31–32).\n\nThe ML began the practice of inviting selected authors to write original\nintroductions to ML editions of their works in the late Boni & Liveright\nera, when Norman Douglas was asked to write an introduction to *South\nWind* (114). Virginia Woolf’s introduction to the ML edition of *Mrs.\nDalloway* (168), published in 1928, is one of the finest examples of\nthis genre. Fitzgerald’s introduction to *The Great Gatsby* was one of\nthe worst. He subsequently expressed a desire to revise it in future\nprintings. When the ML edition was published he wrote: “I do not like\nthe preface. Reading it over it seems to have both flipness and\nincoherance \\[*sic*\\], two qualities which the story that succeeds it\nmanages to avoid” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 15 September 1934). Cerf tried to\nreassure him that the introduction was “thoroughly O.K.” (Cerf to\nFitzgerald, 17 September 1934). The following month Fitzgerald declared,\n“The preface *is* incoherent. I am not even going to revise it, but\nsimply do it over again” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 10 October 1934).\n\nA 1935 presentation copy of the ML edition to Marion Bristow Greene is\ninscribed, “With best wishes from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his neighbor in\nTryon \\[North Carolina\\]” with the additional annotation at the top of\np. vii: “Very bad introduction” (Abebooks listing by Peter Harrington,\nLondon; accessed Abebooks.co.uk, 5 July 2013). At least one copy of the\nML edition—a presentation copy to Elizabeth Lemmon, a close friend of\nMaxwell Perkins—contains revisions to the introduction in Fitzgerald’s\nown hand (Roger Lathbury, posting to ML collector’s listserv\n&lt;modlib@thuban.owu.edu&gt;, 10 November 2011).\n\n*Tender Is the Night*, Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, was published\nin April 1934, five months before the ML edition of *The Great Gatsby*.\nBy 1936 Fitzgerald was campaigning for its inclusion in the ML. He sent\nCerf a telegram asking if he would consider a ML edition of *Tender Is\nthe Night* if he made “certain changes toward the end which I see now\nare essential . . .” (Fitzgerald to Cerf, 16 May 1936; the\ncorrespondence between Fitzgerald and Cerf quoted in this and the\npreceding paragraph is from Myers, pp. 34–38). Two months later he\nwrote, “I would like to have another book on your list, not from vanity\n. . . but simply because I think that two books would be stronger than\none in building up a permanent interest among those whose destiny leads\nthem to accept my observation as part of their cosmology” (Fitzgerald to\nCerf, 23 July 1936; quoted in Turnbull, pp. 536–37). In 1938 Maxwell\nPerkins expressed a “secret hope” of publishing *This Side of Paradise,*\n*The Great Gatsby*, and *Tender Is the Night* as an omnibus volume in\nthe ML, but nothing ever came of this (Bruccoli, *Some Sort of Epic\nGrandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald*, 2d rev, ed., 2002, p. 439).\n\nSales of *The Great Gatsby* were disappointing. The ML edition sold\nabout 700 copies a year and was remaindered in 1939 (Klopfer Oral\nHistory, p. 39). Cerf stated, “The book is one of my personal\nenthusiasms, but I am sorry to say that it has been one of the poorest\nsellers in the whole Modern Library series. . . . I hate to see Scott\nFitzgerald’s name being forgotten!” (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s,\n31 January 1940). Fitzgerald’s popularity revived after his death. By\nthe early 1960s the Scribner paperback edition of *The Great Gatsby* was\nselling 300,000 copies a year (Klopfer Oral History, p. 39).\n\nThere was a second printing of the jacket in fall 1939 after *The Great\nGatsby* was discontinued. All of the fall 1939 jackets examined are\nstamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used to freshen copies sold as\nremainders.\n\n."

In 1927 Cerf told William Lyon\nPhelps, “Macmillan’s, who hold the copyright, have turned a deaf ear to\nall of our proposals. It’s a rotten shame, too, because I think . . . we\ncould sell ten times as many copies of this book as they sell\nthemselves” (Cerf to Phelps, 3 March 1927). Seven years later the ML\npaid Macmillan a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to 19 March 1934). Hugh Eayrs, who wrote the new introduction, was\npresident of the Macmillan Co. of Canada.\n\nThe ML edition (276a) has been seen in a Macmillan binding commonly used\nfor Canadian textbook editions, so there appears to have been some\narrangement between Cerf and Eayrs for distributing copies of the ML\nedition in that format (David Mason, Fine & Rare Books, Toronto, to GBN;\nundated.)\n\n*Maria Chapdelaine* sold 1,885 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fourth worst-selling title.

For more than three\n> years, *The Magic Mountain* (#200) has maintained its position as one\n> of the five best sellers on the Modern Library list. With the addition\n> of *Buddenbrooks* to the series, it is safe to predict that it will\n> take rank with its illustrious predecessor as a book of immense\n> popular appeal. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nLowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by\nAlfred A. Knopf, 1924. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\]–389; \\[1\\]–359) printed\nfrom Knopf plates. Published October 1935. *WR* 2 November 1935. First\nprinting: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1940.\n\nThe ML paid Knopf royalties of 12 cents a copy. Second and third\nprintings of 4,000 copies each were made in March 1937 and May 1938. The\nreprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an\neighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200\nadvance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining\ncopies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of\nKnopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies\n(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing\nunder the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML\nreported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the\nbindery and that *Buddenbrooks* would be completely out of stock within\na few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940). The final royalty\nstatement in February 1941 indicated a payment of $70.92, reflecting\nsales of 591 copies in excess of the 10,000 covered by the advance."

Cerf replied that nothing could be done during the coming\nseason. “Our Fall Modern Library list already includes THE GREAT GATSBY,\nPORGY, and LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL, and that is more than enough Americana\nfor this one installment!” (Cerf to Longwell, 9 April 1934). *Show Boat*\nappeared in the ML the following year and was discontinued five years\nlater.

Edward Newton in the most\n> fascinating of all pursuits—the endlessly revealing search in every\n> ramification of the merits and oddities of books and authors. A prince\n> among bibliophiles, A. Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded\n> his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of\n> *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* made it the unanimous choice of the\n> editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to\n> be welcomed into the series. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression\npublished by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\],\n\\[*16*\\]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from\nthe sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a\nblack-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the\nAtlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and\nprinted with the text. Published December 1935. *WR* 14 December 1935.\nFirst printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.\n\nCerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to *The Amenities of\nBook-Collecting* when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was\nstill selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to\nAlfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24\nAugust 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just\nreturned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we\nhad a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that\ntime I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library\nedition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to\nyou and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about\nit” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he\nwould be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25\nFebruary 1935).\n\nThe Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf\ninitially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he\nwanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay\nonly 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after\nwhich the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to\nMcIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think\nthat Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure\nthat every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale\nof at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the\nbook is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the\npages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).\n\nCerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the\n$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset\n“would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result\nmay not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough\nto suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The\nPolygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the\nplates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work,\nincluding all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints\n(make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408\nfor 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).\n\nNewton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf\ninvited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant\nnot only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but\nspecial attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words,\nthe new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new\nreview of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to\nNewton, 25 April 1935)."

First printing: 5,000 copies. Superseded 1965 by\nGuerney translation (290.2).\n\nHerschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co.,\nasked in 1931 why *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead\nSouls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to\nit. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf,\nundated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). The ML edition was\npublished five years later.\n\nThe ML edition (290.1) was translated by Constance Garnett. Garnett was\nnamed on the title page of other classics of Russian literature\npublished in the ML before the 1960s. The only clue to the translator’s\nidentity in *Dead Souls* is the copyright notice on the verso of the\ntitle page, where she is identified as “Mrs. Edward Garnett.” Odets\nreceived $50 for the introduction (Cerf to Odets, 16 January 1936).\n\n*Dead Souls* sold 3,557 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles.

Discontinued 1973/74. Reissued 1983.\n\nWhen *Daisy Miller & An International Episode* (60) was discontinued in\n1934, the ML was left with a single James volume, *Turn of the Screw;\nThe Lesson of the Master* (189). Klopfer then contacted Houghton\nMifflin: “It occurred to me that it is just about time for us to get a\ndecent Henry James title in the Modern Library.” He expressed interest\nin *The Portrait of a Lady* or *The Tragic Muse* provided the plates fit\nthe ML’s format and offered royalties of 10 cents a copy (Klopfer to\nRobert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 6 June 1934). Linscott replied that\nnothing could be done for a year. Houghton Mifflin had just concluded “a\nlong and difficult negotiation” with the James family to bring out a\nless expensive edition of *The Portrait of a Lady*, and Ferris\nGreenslet, general manager of the trade department, did not want to\nundertake another campaign just then (Linscott to Klopfer, 11 June\n1934).\n\nThree years after the ML edition was published, Linscott showed Klopfer\nthe Houghton Mifflin sales figures for *The Portrait of a Lady* for the\npreceding twelve years (Linscott to Klopfer, 23 May 1939). The figures\nillustrate the effect of the ML edition on sales of the original\npublisher’s edition: 510 copies (1927), 509 copies (1928), 400 copies\n(1929), 402 copies (1930), 309 copies (1931), 192 copies (1932), 112\ncopies (1933), 155 copies (1934), 158 copies (1935), 93 copies (1936,\nwhen the ML edition appeared), 82 copies (1937), 89 copies (1938).\n\n*The Portrait of a Lady* sold 4,308 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. Sales increased by the early 1950s.

Stein offered Millett\n$200 to write an introduction of 3,000–5,000 words (Stein to Millett, 28\nJune 1950). Millett submitted an essay two-and-a-half times the length\nrequested and indicated that Stein could cut it (Millett to Stein, 3\nOctober 1950). The first part was a sketch of James’s life and works,\nthe second part provided an account of the writing of the novel and\nJames’s opinion of it at various times, and the third part consisted of\na critical discussion of the work in light of James’s own criteria and\nthe expectations of the modern reader. Both Stein and Linscott (who had\nmoved to RH from Houghton Mifflin in 1944) were enthusiastic about the\nintroduction but thought it had to be cut. Stein suggested leaving part\n3 largely as it stood, cutting part 1 from 3,000 to 1,000 words, and\neliminating most of part 2. He urged Millett to publish the entire essay\nin a journal like *Kenyon Review* or *Sewanee Review* (Millett to Stein,\n3 October 1950; Millett to Stein 12 October 1950; Stein to Millett, 25\nOctober 1950).\n\nMillett does not appear to have published the complete version of his\nessay. His introduction to the ML edition is the only entry by Millett\nrecorded in Marion Richmond, “Henry James’s *The Portrait of a Lady*: A\nBibliography of Primary Material and Annotated Criticism,” *Henry James\nReview* 7 (Winter–Spring 1986, pp. 164–195).\n\n#### 291.2a.

Accordingly, I would esteem it a\ntremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in\nthe course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of\nFebruary. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get\nall the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January\n1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML\nedition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date\nof the 25th of the month.\n\nThe Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily\naccessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped\nthat an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It\nappeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER\nTOWERS are published under the patronage of <span class=\"smallcaps\">The\nTrollope Society</span>” (p. \\[iv\\]). Klopfer expressed the hope that\nthe ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer\nto Newton, 12 March 1936). But sales were disappointing and no further\nworks by Trollope were added to the series until *The Way We Live Now*\n(639) appeared in 1984.\n\n*Barchester Towers & The Warden* sold 3,196 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.

Published June 1936. *WR* 27 June 1936. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nKraemer, a professor at New York University, proposed the Horace volume.\nHe asked for an advance of $100 and royalties at the standard sliding\nscale for trade books of 10 to 15 percent (Kraemer to Cerf, 20 June\n1935). Cerf agreed to the advance but indicated that the ML could only\npay royalties of 5 percent (Cerf to Kraemer, 25 June 1935). Kraemer\naccepted these terms. *The Complete Works of Horace* reprinted 29 pages\nfrom *Horace and English Verse* translated by Alexander Murison, which\nwas copyrighted by Longmans, Green & Co. in the British Empire but not\nin the United States. Cerf requested permission to use the material, but\nLongmans, Green wanted a fee of twenty guineas. This was more than Cerf\nwas prepared to pay, so the ML used the material without permission. He\ntold Longmans, Green that the ML would confine distribution to the\nUnited States and Canada. Longmans, Green asked its Canadian office to\nstop imports into Canada. T. F. Pike of the Longmans, Green Toronto\noffice wrote to Hugh Eayrs of the Macmillan Co. of Canada, the ML’s\nCanadian distributors, so that he could “advise London my duty has been\ndone” (Pike to Eayrs, 30 November 1936). Eayrs passed his letter along\nto Cerf.\n\n*The Complete Works of Horace* sold 2,730 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 44,171 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 293b.

ML edition\n(294a, pp. \\[*7*\\]–360) printed from offset plates photographically\nreduced from the Smith and Haas edition with page numerals “v–vi”\nremoved from contents pages; 294b–c (pp. v–360) printed letterpress from\nSmith and Haas/RH plates; 294d printed from offset plates\nphotographically reduced from the Smith and Haas edition. Published\nSeptember 1936. *WR* 26 September 1936. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1973/74. Published in Vintage Books, February 1969.\n\n*Man’s Fate* was the first Smith and Haas title added to the ML after\nCerf and Klopfer absorbed the firm in April 1936.\n\nThe Smith and Haas edition measured 8⅜ x 5¾ inches with a type page of\n6⅜ by 3⅝ inches. The plates were far too large for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch\nformat. To include *Man’s Fate* in the series the ML would either have\nto reset the text and make new letterpress plates or photograph a clean\ncopy of the Smith and Haas edition, reduce the type page\nphotographically, and print by offset lithography. The quality of offset\nlithographic printing in the 1930s was inferior to letterpress and the\ncost of each print run was higher, but photographing an existing book\nwas significantly cheaper than making a new typesetting. There were at\nleast two printings of 294a from offset plates, including a September\n1939 printing of 3,000 copies.\n\nThe introduction of the larger ML format in fall 1939 made it possible,\nwith uncomfortably narrow margins, to use the original letterpress\nplates for subsequent ML printings (294b–c). With a top margin that\naveraged about ¼ in. (6 mm), letterpress printings in the 1940s, 1950s,\nand early 1960s were not examples of fine bookmaking. The ML reverted to\noffset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing\ndropped below that of letterpress. *Man’s Fate* is the only ML title to\nhave been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress,\nand again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are\nphotographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making\nprintings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of\ncomfortable margins and freshness of the type.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or\nto Gallimard, the French publisher of *La Condition humaine*.\n\n*Man’s Fate* sold 3,376 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Man’s Hope* (G56), Malraux’s other novel in the ML, sold 2,143\ncopies during the same period. *Man’s Fate* did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 294b.

Its\nrhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the\n1950s:\n\n> In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary\n> impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks,\n> no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is\n> burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading,\n> working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand\n> channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more\n> vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .\n>\n> There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty\n> of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of\n> history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being\n> threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the\n> moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify\n> himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to\n> clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3)\n>\n> Those of us who demand this can now point to *Man’s Fate* and say:\n> ‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).\n\nChevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer\nhearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it\nwas made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the\nhearings.\n\n#### 294d.

(*Fall\n> 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by P. R. Reynolds, 1908, and Duffield &\nCo., 1909, probably using printed sheets or duplicate plates of the\nEnglish edition published by William Heinemann, 1908. New\nbibliographical edition published by W. W. Norton & Co., 1930. ML\nedition (pp. \\[1\\]–566) printed from Norton plates. Published October\n1936. *WR* 31 October 1936. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1940.\n\nA ML edition of *Maurice Guest* was suggested by at least two people.\nThe ML’s traveler for the Middle West passed along a bookseller’s\nsuggestion for the novel (James L. Crowder to Cerf, 1 October 1934), and\nW. W. Norton appears to have suggested a ML reprint. Cerf expressed\nreservations about its sales potential: “May I ask you on what terms you\nwill be prepared to let us publish MAURICE GUEST in the Modern Library\nthis Fall? I agree with you that it is a fine book, but am a little\ndoubtful as to just how big a seller it would be” (Cerf to Walter\nNorton, W. W. Norton & Co., 2 January 1936).\n\nHenry Handel Richardson was the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay\nRichardson. Commins identified the author as Henrietta Richardson in the\nfirst draft of his biographical note and indicated that “Handel” had\nbeen taken from the name of the composer. Norton asked Cerf to omit the\nreference since neither Norton nor Heinemann, her English publisher, had\never made Richardson’s identity public. He also pointed out that she had\nbeen married for over thirty years to an important figure in English\nletters (the philologist John George Robertson) and was no longer Miss\nRichardson (Norton to Cerf, 28 July 1936). Commins left in the reference\nto “Miss Richardson” but omitted information about to her real name.\n\nThe ML edition was not a success. Copies of the first printing have been\nseen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper."

With\n> *The Red and the Black* (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his\n> two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures\n> the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (*Fall\n> 1936*)\n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni &\nLiveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of *The Works of Stendhal*. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–290; \\[*1*\\]–343) printed from B&L plates. Published January\n1937. *WR* 23 January 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued\nfall 1943.\n\nArthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to\nsecure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the\nreprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured\nCerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to\nCerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline; *The\nCharterhouse of Parma* went to press without an introduction, and sales\nwere disappointing.\n\nTotal printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies\n(November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March\n1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold\ncopies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth\nformat, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in\nthe larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information\nabout Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears\nunder “General” in the chapter for 1939.)\n\nWartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading\nmatter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to drop *The\nCharterhouse of Parma*, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to\nother titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in\nfall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among\nacademics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by\nGeorge Mayberry in the *New Republic* (8 November 1943, p. 661):\n\n> An Open Letter\n>\n> The Modern Library, Inc.,\n>\n> New York City.\n>\n> Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply\n> shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and\n> John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The\n> Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August\n> 15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if\n> no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence\n> in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in\n> Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for\n> comment.\n>\n> One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are\n> dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be\n> quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the\n> ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of\n> nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently\n> dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied\n> invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first\n> chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no\n> public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he\n> somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among\n> whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed.\n>\n> You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of\n> the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold\n> in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of\n> time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever\n> immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of\n> commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness.\n>\n> May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great\n> book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print\n> will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even\n> if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up\n> remaindered copies at Macy’s.\n>\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">George Mayberry</span>\n\nCerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by\nMayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,” *New\nRepublic*, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):\n\n> Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the\n> Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our\n> announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma”\n> from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken?\n>\n> The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in\n> 1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year,\n> when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The\n> Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the\n> Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under\n> present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us\n> that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from\n> the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the\n> Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would\n> have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for\n> somewhere between four and five years. \\[*This statement was not\n> strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had\n> reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time*.\\]\n>\n> May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop\n> titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept\n> there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy\n> growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine\n> reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of\n> obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor\n> the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their\n> shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and\n> quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular\n> numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is\n> losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a\n> favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some\n> dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the\n> Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of\n> eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial\n> period in actual sales.\n>\n> Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s\n> “The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library.\n> Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The\n> Charterhouse of Parma.”\n>\n> BENNETT A. CERF\n\nMayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:\n\n> \\[I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original\n> letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to\n> the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of\n> making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep\n> “such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without\n> seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the\n> Modern Library. —G.M.\\]\n\nIntellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation of *The\nCharterhouse of Parma* became a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little\nmagazine *Pharos* published a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry\nLevin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at\nHarvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the\npublishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against\ntheir country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s\nmasterpiece *The Charterhouse of Parma* because they thought they were\nunable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature as\n*Life with Father* and *Rebecca*” (*Pharos*, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).\n\nLevin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which\nconsisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”:\n“. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English,\nin spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in\nAmerica, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal\nhas received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).\n\nJames T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization\nof publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in\nrecent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their\nstock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing?\nSome Observations on the Future of Books,” *New Directions* 9, 1946, p.\n13).\n\nWhen Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality”\nor “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a\nclaim to the intellectual audience by making *The Charterhouse of Parma*\nhis first title.\n\nIn 1999, fifty-six years after *The Charterhouse of Parma* was\ndiscontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by\nRichard Howard. That edition, in paperback, was in print as of 2016.\n\n#### 298b. Title page reset (1940)\n\nTHE | CHARTERHOUSE | OF PARMA | BY STENDHAL | (HENRI BEYLE) | WITH A\nSTUDY OF M.

This carefree tale of the\n> exploits of three lovable rogues won the unanimous praise of critics\n> and reading public alike. Now it is included in the Modern Library\n> series, partly as a tribute to the novel’s own enchantment and partly\n> because John Steinbeck has earned the right to a place in a library of\n> the foremost writers of our time. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Covici, Friede, 1935; publishing rights\nand plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp.\nv–\\[317\\]) printed from Covici, Friede (later Covici, Friede/Viking)\nplates. Published September 1937. *WR* 25 September 1937. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nSteinbeck’s foreword begins: “When this book was written, it did not\noccur to me that paisanos were curious or quaint, dispossessed or\nunderdoggish. They are people whom I know and like, people who merge\nsuccessfully with their habitat. . . . Had I known that these stories\nand these people would be considered quaint, I think I never should have\nwritten them” (p. \\[i\\]). When he submitted the foreword he told Cerf,\n“It is the only thing I want to say. If it won’t do—throw it out and\nhave someone else do it. This is not a clever introduction” (Steinbeck\nto Cerf, undated but probably June 1937). He also asked that the ML\nedition be dedicated to Susan Gregory of Monterey. The dedication was\nretained in later Viking printings.\n\nSubsequent printings of the ML edition include the following: 3,000\ncopies (August 1938); 3,000 copies (July 1939); 5,000 copies (December\n1939); 2,000 copies (July 1941); 6,000 copies (December 1942). *Tortilla\nFlat* sold 13,432 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the fourth best-selling title in the\nregular series and thirteenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. The\nunusually strong sales of *Tortilla Flat* at this period may have been\nstimulated by the release of the 1942 film version starring Spencer\nTracy and Hedy Lamarr.\n\nDuring the same period *The Grapes of Wrath* (341) ranked in the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 9,495 copies. *Of Mice and\nMen* (311) and *In Dubious Battle* (322) were in the second quarter with\nsales of 7,020 copies and 6,028 copies respectively. By the early 1950s\n(November 1951–October 1952) *The Grapes of Wrath* was the only\nSteinbeck title among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\n#### 304b.

First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe ML and Houghton Mifflin Co. both published Thoreau collections in\nSeptember 1937. When the ML edition was announced, Robert Linscott of\nHoughton Mifflin told Klopfer that his firm was “rather daunted” by the\nnews. Houghton Mifflin had thought that the ML was giving up its\ncollection and would have abandoned *The Works of Thoreau*, an 872-page\nvolume edited by Henry Seidel Canby, if it had known the ML was going\nahead. The Houghton Mifflin collection included selections from\nThoreau’s journals, which were still protected by copyright and had not\nbeen available to the ML. Linscott offered to lease the plates of\nCanby’s volume to the ML within eighteen months if the ML gave up its\nvolume (Linscott to Klopfer, 7 July 1937). Klopfer replied that the ML\nhad changed its plans as much as it could when the conflict was\ndiscovered and expressed the hope that the two books would not interfere\nwith each other (Klopfer to Linscott, 8 July 1937).\n\nWhen the Viking Portable Thoreau appeared in 1949, Brooks Atkinson told\nCerf that it was “such a good job that your Modern Library Thoreau\nvolume is behind the eight-ball.” He suggested replacing the selections\nfrom *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers* on pp. 301–436 with\nthe complete work (Atkinson to Cerf, 4 March 1949). Commins replied that\nhe hoped Atkinson would allow the ML edition to remain unchanged. The\ncomplete text of *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers*, he noted,\nwould add 200 pages to the collection, at a resetting cost of around\n$2,000; changing the page numerals from p. 437 to the end would cost an\nadditional $200 or $300 (Commins to Atkinson, 1 April 1949). The ML\nnever acted on Atkinson’s suggestion.\n\n*Walden and Other Writings* sold over 6,000 copies by early 1939 (Cerf\nto Robert Lamont, Atlantic Monthly Press, 26 May 1939). It sold 11,558\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it\nthe ninth best-selling title in the regular ML. During the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,694 copies, making it the\nregular ML’s thirty-second best-selling title.\n\n#### 305b.

Following the\n> publication of *The 42nd Parallel*, *1919* and *The Big Money* will be\n> issued in successive seasons. By this plan, John Dos Passos’ original\n> intention of maintaining the unity of the three novels will be\n> fulfilled. (*Fall 1937*)\n\nOriginally published by Harper & Brothers, 1930; rights subsequently\nacquired by Harcourt, Brace & Co. ML edition of *The 42nd Parallel*\nprinted from plates made from a new Harcourt, Brace typesetting with\nrevisions by the author. The plates were subsequently used for the\none-volume edition of *U.S.A.* published by Harcourt, Brace in January\n1938 and reprinted in ML Giants in 1939. Published 10 November 1937.\n*WR* 13 November 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued fall\n1940 after the ML published *U.S.A.* as a Giant (G42).\n\nThe ML signed a contract with Harcourt, Brace to publish *The 42nd\nParallel*, *Nineteen Nineteen*, and *The Big Money* in the regular ML in\nthe fall seasons of 1937, 1938, and 1939 (Cerf to Dos Passos, 23 June\n1937). The ML appears to have offered a $1,000 advance against royalties\nof 10 cents a copy for each volume. Cerf indicated after signing the\nreprint contract, “I am really delighted that we are going to have these\nbooks in the Modern Library. John Dos Passos is exactly the kind of\nauthor that we can sell in this series” (Cerf to Donald Brace, 13 May\n1937).\n\nHarcourt, Brace reset *The 42nd Parallel*, incorporating corrections of\na large number of typographical errors submitted by Dos Passos. The ML\nedition was the first printing from the new typesetting. Dos Passos had\nalso made extensive revisions for the ML edition of *Three Soldiers*\n(248).\n\nCerf asked Dos Passos to write a short foreword to the ML edition of\n*The 42nd Parallel*, noting that he believed his foreword to the ML\nedition of *Three Soldiers* (248) “materially helped the sale of the\nbook.” He offered the usual $50 fee with the apology that the ML\ncouldn’t afford more but enclosed a ML list and invited Dos Passos to\nselect any books he wanted (Cerf to Dos Passos, ibid.). Dos Passos\neventually selected about a hundred titles. He promised to send a short\nintroduction and noted, “I’m not quite sure whether this is the time to\nspill the fact that the narratives will be collected into a one volume\nnovel under the name of *U.S.A.* or not” (Dos Passos to Cerf, 4 July\n1937).\n\nThe introduction to the ML edition, dated July 1937, begins:\n\n> *The 42nd Parallel* is the first volume of *U. S. A.*, a long\n> narrative which deals with the more or less entangled lives of a\n> number of Americans during the first three decades of the present\n> century. The volumes that follow are called *1919* and *The Big\n> Money*.\n>\n> In an effort to take in as much as possible of the broad field of the\n> lives of these times, three separate sequences have been threaded in\n> and out among the stories. Of these *The Camera Eye* aims to indicate\n> the position of the observer and *Newsreel* to give an inkling of the\n> common mind of the epoch. Portraits of a number of real people are\n> interlarded in the pauses in the narrative because their lives seem to\n> embody so well the quality of the soil in which Americans of these\n> generations grew.\n>\n> This method was used with the idea of coping with the particular job\n> in hand rather than from any generalized theory about novelwriting\n> \\[*sic*\\]. In fact I don’t think any such theory holds water. The\n> shape of a piece of work should be imposed, and in a good piece of\n> work always is imposed, by the matter. That’s more or less of a\n> commonplace of a considerable body of literary criticism.\n\nThe ML later renegotiated the reprint contract so that the trilogy could\nappear as a Giant rather than separate volumes in the regular ML.\n*U.S.A.* (G42) was published as a Giant in February 1939, and *The 42nd\nParallel* was discontinued as a separate volume in fall 1940.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (1932–1963) 248\n\nDos Passos, *U.S.A.* (1939–1962) G42"

ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–186) printed from Covici, Friede/Viking\nplates. Published February 1938. *WR* 5 March 1938. First printing: Not\nascertained.\n\nCerf and Klopfer arranged the ML reprint with Covici, Friede, which had\nbeen Steinbeck’s publisher since the publication of his fourth novel,\n*Tortilla Flat*, in 1935*.* The close working relationship between\nSteinbeck and his editor Pascal Covici was comparable to those between\nF. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway with Maxwell Perkins at Charles\nScribner’s Sons. Covici, Friede failed shortly after *Of Mice and Men*\nappeared in the ML. The firm was acquired by Viking Press, Covici became\na Viking editor, and Steinbeck became a Viking author. Arrangements for\nthe second ML printing were made with Viking Press in October 1938.\n\nThere were four ML printings between October 1938 and September 1942\ntotaling 10,000 copies. Steinbeck’s first book with Viking Press, *The\nGrapes of Wrath*, sold 430,000 copies in less than a year and was the\nbest-selling work of fiction for 1939 (Madison, pp. 306–7; Hackett and\nBurke, p. 127).\n\nWhen *Of Mice and Men* was published in the ML it had to compete with a\n39-cent reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books. Lewis Miller, the Random\nHouse sales manager, told one of the sales representatives: “Bennett\nfelt strongly that the book deserved a place in the Modern Library, no\nmatter what other editions were to be had” (Miller to Rosengren, 24\nJanuary 1938).\n\n*Of Mice and Men* sold 7,020 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. Sales of all four Steinbeck titles in the ML totaled 35,975\ncopies during this period. *The Grapes of Wrath* was the only Steinbeck\nnovel among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 311b.

(*Spring 1938*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published April 1938. *WR* 9 April 1938. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nSeveral months before *The Wisdom of Confucius* was published Cerf wrote\nto a publishers’ representative in New Zealand, “I call your particular\nattention to the Confucius volume, edited by Lin Yutang. I think this\nwill prove one of the most popular titles we have ever had, and we\nexpect about three times the normal advance sale on it” (Cerf to Nash &\nKissling, 17 November 1937). Cerf’s prediction was correct. *The Wisdom\nof Confucius* was one of the ML’s best-selling titles. In 1942 it was\nthe third best-selling title in the series.\n\nWhile working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough\nto think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on\nConfucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and\nbesides the introduction, it will be principally the work of\ntranslating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript\nwill be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January\n1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s\nfinancial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He\nreceived $300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April\n1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a\nflat fee or was an advance against royalties.\n\nLin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did\nnot read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the\ncollection appears to have been challenged. In 1939 Random House paid\n$250 for all rights to Miles Menander Dawson’s *The Conduct of Life (The\nEthics of Confucius)*, originally published by International Press in\n1915.\n\n*The Wisdom of Confucius* sold 12,000 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it seventeenth out of 281 ML and\nGiant titles. Sales declined by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952 it sold 4,036 copies, making it\nsixty-first out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\n#### 312.1b.

Discontinued\n1970/71.\n\nThe Longmans, Green plates were too large for the ML’s 6½ by 4¼ inch\nformat. To avoid resetting the text the ML the published *Lust for Life*\nin the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would become standard for ML books\nbeginning in fall 1939.\n\nLewis Miller, the RH sales manager, liked the larger format. He\nconsidered *Lust for Life* the most presentable book the ML had\npublished, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT\nSHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also\nregarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and\nappearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did\nnot have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar\nreprint published by Grosset & Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8\nFebruary 1939).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It\nsold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it high in the second quarter of ML titles. Adjusted for 18\nmonths, 1951–52 sales exceed those for 1942–43 by fewer than 100 copies;\nthe ranking of *Lust for Life* in the third quarter of ML sales during\n1942–43 reflects the increase in demand for books of all kinds during\nthe Second World War.\n\nPocket Books, Inc., published *Lust for Life* as a 25-cent paperback in\n1945. The film version of Stone’s novel starring Kirk Douglas, released\nin 1956, probably led to an increase in sales of the ML edition, but\nsales figures for the mid-1950s are not available.\n\n#### 317b.

The\nabridgment reduced the text from 635 to 285 pages.\n\nWhen the RH edition of *The War in Outline* was published Cerf wrote to\nEugene O’Neill, who had lent him an earlier book by Liddell Hart: “I was\nso deeply impressed by that book that I swore that one day we’d get\nsomething by Hart \\[*sic*\\] for Random House. This is one time anyhow\nthat a dream came true!” (Cerf to O’Neill, 21 September 1936). Cerf does\nnot appear to have realized that Liddell Hart was a compound surname.\nThe author’s forenames, Basil Henry, were omitted from the title pages\nof Random House and ML printings and also from the jacket, and *The War\nin Outline* was entered under “Hart” in ML lists and catalogues.\n\nThe ML edition sold 2,481 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing it among the thirty worst-selling titles for that period.

The ML edition\nincludes none of the illustrations from the Nonesuch Press edition, but\nboth 319a and 319b retain Keynes’s reference to “the portrait by Jacob\nHuysman, from which the copper-plate in the present work has been\nengraved” (p. 12); a footnote indicates that the portrait is in the\nNational Portrait Gallery, London. The revised “Life of Izaak Walton” in\n319c omits the words, “from which the copper-plate in the present work\nhas been engraved.” Keynes also refers to a pastel portrait of Walton by\nEdmund Ashfield. A footnote in 319a and 319b states, “Now in the\npossession of Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York”; the footnote in 319c\nreads, “Formerly in the possession of the late Dr. Samuel Lambert of New\nYork” (p. 12).\n\nThe ML edition sold 2,617 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing *The Compleat Angler* in the fourth quarter of ML titles during\nthat 18-month period.

The printing with the spring 1949 jacket is probably the first\nfrom the reset plates. The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s\nmother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed\nKeynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton,\nsurvived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of\nStafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A\nfootnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter\nfrom Arthur M. Coon of Cornell University in *The Times Literary\nSupplement* (25 December 1937).\n\nThe fall 1952 printing of the jacket was the last in three colors. The\nfall 1954 jacket in two colors (black and strong green) may have been a\nresponse to rising costs of color printing or declining sales of *The*\n*Compleat Angler*. The ML edition of *The Compleat Angler* was\ndiscontinued at the end of 1957."

The\n> felicity of writing, the charm and dramatic power of these tales,\n> their dignity and beauty, create a spell for readers of every shade of\n> interest. Dorothy Canfield contributes an illuminating introduction.\n> (*Spring 1939*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1934,\ntwo years before the firm was acquired by Random House. ML edition (pp.\nv–420) printed from Smith and Haas/RH plates with decorative borders\nomitted from part title pages and part titles printed in black gothic\ntype instead of red. Published April 1939. *WR* 8 April 1939. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. Published in Vintage\nBooks, September 1972; restored to ML, 1980.\n\nThe 7⅛ x 4⅞ in. format was used because the original plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s standard balloon cloth format. Even with the larger\nformat the margins of the printed pages are uncomfortably narrow. The\nswitch from letterpress to offset lithographic printing in the 1960s\nallowed the type page of 320c to be reduced photographically from 160 x\n98 mm to 146 x 90 mm. This allowed larger margins, but the substantial\nreduction in type size made the text harder to read. A happy medium is\nachieved in 320d. The format is increased to 7½ x 4⅞ in., and the type\npage has been increased photographically to 155 x 88 mm. However, the\nvolume is an early example of perfect binding rather than sewn, and it\nis not unusual to find copies today that are falling apart.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,154 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing *Seven Gothic Tales* near the top of the second quarter of ML\ntitles during this 18-month period. It was not among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952. In contrast, sales of Dinesen’s *Out of\nAfrica* (447), published in the ML in April 1952, placed it near the top\nof the second quarter of ML sales for the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 320b.

(*Fall 1939*)\n\nOriginally published by Covici, Friede, 1936; new bibliographical\nedition published by Viking Press, August 1939. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*7*\\]–343) printed from Viking plates**.** Published September 1939.\n*WR* 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nThe ML secured exclusive reprint rights to *In Dubious Battle* shortly\nbefore the publication of *The Grapes of Wrath* in 1939 vastly enlarged\nSteinbeck’s audience. An earlier reprint had been published by Blue\nRibbon Books in October 1937, but it sold poorly and was out of print by\nNovember 1938. Lewis Miller expected the success of *The Grapes of\nWrath* to stimulate interest in all of Steinbeck’s books (Miller to\nCrowder, 11 July 1939). In a memo to the sales force he urged the\ntravelers to open their sales talks with *In Dubious Battle*:\n\n> We got the sole reprint rights before GRAPES OF WRATH leaped to\n> best-sellerdom and very lucky, too, for I am convinced it would have\n> been more advantageous to the Viking crowd to have given the book to\n> Grosset as well as to us. We would in that case have shared the market\n> and perhaps not a big share either. If Grosset had IN DUBIOUS BATTLE\n> they would get an advance of 20,000 to 25,000 copies, in my judgment.\n> We are looking for an 8,000 to 10,000 advance on the strength of the\n> fact that this brand new army of Steinbeck readers is now wide open\n> for his past work. Every bookstore you call on has sold good\n> quantities of GRAPES OF WRATH and that’s the market for IN DUBIOUS\n> BATTLE. . . . Remember that IN DUBIOUS BATTLE does not take up much\n> room and you have got to get at least a 25-stack if you expect the\n> public to see it. We want 25’s, 50’s and 100’s. If a dealer buries\n> this title on a shelf in 1’s and 2’s, we are licked before we start.\n> (RH Box 153, Sales folder)\n\nThe ML distributed a four-color display poster to bookstores that\ndescribed *In Dubious Battle* as “a long, full, satisfying novel that\ndeals with the same kind of characters and the same background as THE\nGRAPES OF WRATH” and launched a $7,500 advertising campaign that\nfeatured *In Dubious Battle* along with Steinbeck’s other ML titles,\n*Tortilla Flat* and *Of Mice and Men* (*PW*, 5 August 1939, p. 351). A\nspecial discount was offered for combination orders of all three\nSteinbeck titles: 41 percent for 50 copies, 40 + 5 percent for 100\ncopies, and 44 percent for of 250 copies. The 40 + 5 percent discount\nwas normally reserved for the ML’s biggest customers, such as\nBrentano’s, Macy’s, and Marshall Field & Co., who obtained ML books\n(list price 95 cents) for 55 cents instead of the 57 cents paid by\nbooksellers who got a straight 40 percent discount. Booksellers who\nreceived this discount were expected to promote the series aggressively.\n\n“You can see the leverage you get with such a schedule,” Miller told the\ntravelers. “You may get a dealer who can buy only 25 IN DUBIOUS BATTLE\nand you now have got a wedge to get 25 assorted out of the other two.\nAnd so on, up the scale” (RH Box 153, Sales folder). He also reminded\nthem, “In selling this title don’t overlook the point that, because the\nbook will be bound in stiff covers, it lends itself admirably to lending\nlibrary use in addition to over-the-counter sales” (Miller to Consolino,\n31 July 1939).\n\n*The Grapes of Wrath* led the 1939 best-seller list and remained one of\nthe ten best-selling fiction titles in 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp.\n127–29). Sales figures for the ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* are not\navailable for 1939 and 1940. The ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* sold\n6,028 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943,\nplacing it in the second quarter of ML titles—but by then *The Grapes of\nWrath* itself was available in the ML. *In Dubious Battle* was not among\nthe 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month\nperiod, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 322b.

But the novel grew beyond its first intention\n> and became more than a mere parody. In its own right it earned the\n> status of one of the major works of fiction of the mid-eighteenth\n> century and was the forerunner of Fielding’s masterpiece, *Tom Jones*\n> (Modern Library No. 185). Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on\n> the pretenses and follies of English society, *Joseph Andrews* is a\n> novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and\n> sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the\n> master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired.\n> (*Spring 1954*)\n\nPublished initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.\n\nWhen *Joseph Andrews* was included on the first list of titles to be\npublished in MLCE, Stein offered Jones $75 to add a bibliography and\ninvited him to look over the introduction to see if he would like to\nmake any changes (Stein to Jones, 27 January 1950).

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1949.\n\nCerf tried to include *A Passage to India* in the ML shortly after he\nand Klopfer acquired the series (Cerf to Alfred Harcourt, 10 March\n1926). Harcourt, Brace was agreeable but decided to ask Forster’s\npermission. Nine months later Harcourt reported, “The upshot of our\ncorrespondence with him is that we are forced to the decision not to\nsell this book to The Modern Library for next year” (Harcourt, Brace to\nCerf, 11 December 1926). *A Passage to India* did not appear in the ML\nuntil thirteen years later.\n\nShortly after the Second World War, Harcourt, Brace launched its own\nhardbound reprint series, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the\nburgeoning college market.

At that time the ML had 3,300 copies of *A\nPassage to India* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight\nmonths for the stock to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June\n1948). *A Passage to India* sold 6,654 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and\nGiant titles.

Discontinued 1969/70.\n\n*The Short Bible* was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed\nto secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s *The Complete Bible:\nAn American Translation* (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they\nwanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a $5,000 advance for *The\nComplete Bible* ($3,000 on signing and $2,000 one year after\npublication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think\nwe could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to\nDonald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the\nUniversity of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of *The Complete\nBible* was premature, Cerf offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of\n10 cents a copy for *The Short Bible* (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939).\nShortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean\nto run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became\nActing Manager of the Press.\n\nCerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting *The Complete\nBible*. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with\nGoodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the\ncomplete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to\nthe Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf\nPapers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from\nCalifornia he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and\nGoodspeed had decided against a ML edition of *The Short Bible*. He\nreported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . .\nyou and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up\nthe Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until\nwe can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant\nedition of the *Complete Bible*. I told him that we both understand full\nwell that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but\nif we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to\nguarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of\nour contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December\n1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).\n\nLewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead\nwith *The Short Bible*. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell\nwell, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML\nrejected it, and that whichever firm got *The Short Bible* would have a\n“toe-hold” on *The Complete Bible*. He recommended that the ML secure\n*The Short Bible* on the understanding that it would get *The Complete\nBible* if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and\nKlopfer’s concern that a ML edition of *The Short Bible* might injure\ntheir chances of getting *The Complete Bible* if it sold poorly but\nconcluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23\nFebruary 1940).\n\nCerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three\ndays later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for\n*The Short Bible* was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After\nsigning Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a\nreprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given\nthe first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this\nedition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).\n\nTwo years later Cerf offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy for reprint rights to *The Complete Bible*. Hemens replied\nthat it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be\ndifferent the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to\nCerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that\nmany readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have\nthe complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really\nimpressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). *The Complete\nBible* never appeared in the ML.\n\nThe text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted\nand abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago\nPress jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and\nappealing than that of the original edition.\n\nThe ML edition of *The Short Bible* sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942\nand 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There\nwas a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional\nprintings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and\nprintings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January\n1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML\ntitles.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*The Holy Bible*, illus.

He asked Little, Brown for a\ncopy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about\nan hour raving about C. S. Forester’s THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and swore that\nit was an ideal suggestion for the Modern Library” (Cerf to Alfred B.\nMcIntyre, Little, Brown, 2 October 1939). The ML paid Little, Brown\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years\nbefore the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.\n\nForester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters\nomitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the\nforeword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in\nwriting another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the\nend of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end\nwithout calling for any effort from me. The fact that no effort was\ncalled for was sufficient inducement. I wrote blithely and agreed, and\nit was only when my complimentary copies reached me in England that I\nreally appreciated what had happened to the book when it had been docked\nof its last two \\[*sic*\\] chapters. . . .

In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was\npleased that *Flowering Judas* was to be included in the series. She\nwrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I\nhope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a\nbuyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library\na God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have\nmore.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly,\na kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book;\nauthors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little\non the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8\nMay 1940).\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943.\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier\nthat year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book\nsells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of\nletting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).\n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was\nterminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S.\nSpencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400\ncopies of *Flowering Judas* in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it\nwould take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3\nJune 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued\nin fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s\n*Light in August* (429), which was published in the series shortly after\n*Flowering Judas* was discontinued.\n\nHarcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including *Flowering Judas*\nin Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring\n1953.

It has a touch of God in it, and\n> the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading\n> public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its\n> heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act\n> of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, *Kitty\n> Foyle*, as well as those who have yet to experience their first\n> acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of\n> *Human Being*. (*Fall 1940*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights\nsubsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*–*7*\\], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a\ncorrection requested by Morley. Published October 1940. *WR* 12 October\n1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.\n\nThe suggestion to include *Human Being* in the ML came from Morley\nhimself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):\n\n> Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little\n> to see myself represented in there only by *Parnassus on Wheels*; a\n> worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look\n> at it now.\n>\n> I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in\n> *Human Being*, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in\n> retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get\n> a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the\n> Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person;\n> a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.\n\nCerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be\nrepresented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I\ndon’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be\nadded; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley\nbacklist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted\nthat he had never read *Human Being* and asked Morley to send him a copy\n(Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he\nstill thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general\ninterest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think\nthat a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was\nable to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf\nto Morley, 30 August 1939).\n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett\nand Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing\n*Human Being* in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would\nprefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf\nagreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob \\[Haas\\] and I still think it\nis a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and\nthe huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to\nMorley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a $500 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition\ncorrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.\n\n*Human Being* sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML.\nMorley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten\nworst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that\ncategory. *Parnassus on Wheels* (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was\nthe second worst-selling title.\n\nThere was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By\nFebruary 1944 sales of the ML edition of *Human Being* exceeded 6,000\ncopies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMorley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (1931–1954) 213"

Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to\ndesign trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the\nplates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such\nas the removal of running heads.\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May\n1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML\ntitles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the\nML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was\nout of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print\nand that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to\nSaroyan, 5 April 1949)."

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on\nthe first printing of Hugo’s *Notre-Dame de Paris* (1831) and does not\ninclude three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in\nDecember 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and\nBook Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation\nused by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and\nBook Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and\n5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not\n“augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The\nthree added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been\nmisplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be\nincluded in the 1832 printing (Hugo, *Notre-Dame de Paris*, translated\nand edited by John Sturrock \\[London: Penguin Books, 2004\\], pp. 26–29).\n\nThe absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill\nThat), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the\nprinting press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the\npublic expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during\nthe world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan\npagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of\nthe human race.

The\nfirst printing of the ML edition failed to acknowledge the Foundation.\nIt included instead the following statement, adapted from the National\nHome Library Foundation edition: “Acknowledgment is made, with thanks,\nfor the aid received from the *Carnegie Corporation of New York* in\nmaking possible this edition of *The Federalist*” (p. \\[iv\\]). The ML\nremoved the title leaf of remaining copies of the first printing and\ntipped in a new title leaf which acknowledged the National Home Library\nFoundation on the verso (338a<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,782 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing it low in the first quarter of ML titles.

Klopfer agreed to rip the title leaf out of\nevery copy in stock and tip in a corrected leaf with the acknowledgment,\n“The publishers are indebted to the National Home Library Foundation for\nmaking this edition possible and wish to thank them for the courtesy\nextended in the use of their plates” (Klopfer to Mittell, 27 February\n1941; Mittell to Klopfer, 4 March 1941).

Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition\nwith a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN\nLIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot\nof the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML\njacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the\nBemelmans drawing on the title page.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own\n> foibles in wartime.

Both amiable and\n> wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its\n> illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and\n> civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a\n> reprint edition.\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. \\[3\\],\n\\[5\\]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised.

First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1948.\n\nThe verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,\n“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway\nPrinting Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The\nML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that\nspecialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its\nstandard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible\nthat Parkway subcontracted the job.\n\nThere are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a\nML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were\nprinted from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset\nprinting.\n\nThe jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and\nthe inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings\nof the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring\n1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so\nthey could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.\n\nThe ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl\nHarbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings\nare on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to\nenhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset\nlithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of\nwartime paper shortages.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and\nGiant titles."

Cerf told\nKnopf that he planned to offer Appleton a $600 advance against royalties\nof 6 cents a copy and would probably publish it in the ML without\npermission if Appleton rejected the offer (Cerf to Knopf, 2 December\n1932). Neither Knopf nor Cerf went ahead with their plans**.** When the\nML published *The Red Badge of Courage* ten years later it was by\narrangement with Appleton-Century and printed from Appleton plates. The\nML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy.\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,660 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942‑October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML titles.\nThe release of John Huston’s film version in 1951 appears to have\nboosted sales. The ML edition sold 7,418 copies between November 1951\nand October 1952, making *The Red Badge of Courage* the19th best-selling\ntitle in the series.\n\n#### 347.1b.

Stein, who edited Modern\nLibrary College Editions, wanted to add several stories by Crane to the\nvolume, in part because he thought it might forestall Rinehart & Co.\nfrom bringing out a competing edition in their paperback series for the\ncollege market (Stein to Stallman, 11 July 1950; Stein memo to Haas, 28\nAugust 1950). Stallman suggested “Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,” “The\nOpen Boat,” “An Episode of War,” “The Upturned Face,” and “A Mystery of\nHeroism.” Stein hoped to secure permission to include the stories for a\nflat fee, but Knopf insisted on a royalty. Appleton-Century-Crofts was\ncharging a 2-cent royalty for the use of their plates for MLCE\nprintings. Adding the stories would have increased the royalty for MLCE\nprintings to 4 cents a copy and also added to the cost of the regular ML\nedition. Haas indicated that this was too much, and plans to include the\nstories were abandoned (Haas to Stein, 30 August 1950).\n\n#### 347.1c.

His\n> portrait of George F. Babbitt, realtor, is so firm in the minds of all\n> English–speaking people that the name has become incorporated into the\n> language as a permanent word. Readers of every language into which\n> *Babbitt* has been translated regard it as Sinclair Lewis’s\n> masterpiece and have created from it a conception of an American type\n> of the prosaic but always human business man. (*Fall 1941*)\n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1922. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*7*\\]–401) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published February\n1942. *WR* 14 February 1942. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued\n1 January 1949.\n\nThe first Harcourt, Brace printing, published in September 1922, exists\nin two states, with the second state containing two corrections on p. 49\n(“Lyte” instead of “Purdy” in line 3, “any” instead of “my” in line 5).\nThree more corrections were made in the second printing, one correction\n(“for” instead of “against” on p. 392, line 1) was made in the third\nprinting, and eleven more corrections were made in the fourth printing,\nmaking the fourth printing “the most authoritative version of the work”\n(John Hersey, “Note on the Texts,” *Main Street & Babbitt* \\[New York:\nLibrary of America, 1992\\], p. 883).\n\nHarcourt, Brace anticipated strong sales and made a duplicate set of\nplates, probably before *Babbitt* was published. The duplicate plates\nincorporate the corrections in the second state of the first printing\nbut not those in the second, third, or fourth printings, which were made\nbetween October and November 1922. The duplicate plates or shells, which\nappear to have been made in July 1922, were held in reserve.\n\nWhen the ML negotiated reprint rights in 1941, Harcourt, Brace melted\nthe original plates, which had become worn, and provided the duplicate\nplates to the ML for its printings. ML printings, as well as later\nprintings in Harbrace Modern Classics (1950) and other reprint editions,\nrevert to the text of the second state of the first printing, and do not\ninclude the corrections made in the second, third, and fourth printings\n(Matthew J. Bruccoli, “Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis’s *Babbitt*,”\n*Studies in Bibliography* 11 (1958): 263–68; available online at\n[http://www.bsuva.org](http://www.bsuva.org/). For the next fifty years\nall American printings—including the paperback edition in Signet\nClassics (1961)—appear to have omitted the corrections made to the text\nin the third, fourth, and fifth Harcourt, Brace printings. The\ncorrections were restored in the Library of America edition of *Main\nStreet & Babbitt* (1992) but many subsequent editions, such as the\nBantam paperback published in 1998, continued to be set from flawed\nearlier printings.\n\nTo secure *Babbitt* Cerf agreed to a three-year reprint contract, after\nwhich Harcourt, Brace had the right to cancel the contracts for the ML\neditions of both *Babbitt* and *Arrowsmith*, with the cancellations to\nbe effective on the same date. He told Harcourt, “I shall be curious to\nsee just how the Pocket Book \\[mass market paperback\\] edition of\nARROWSMITH affects both your edition and ours of that book!” (Cerf to\nHastings Harcourt, 31 July 1941).\n\nLewis became a RH author in 1939 when he followed his editor Harry Maule\nfrom Doubleday to Random House. *Arrowsmith* (243) had been in the\nModern Library since 1933, but Lewis wanted to have more of his books in\nthe series. Maule conveyed the good news that *Babbitt* would be added\nto the series: “Bennett and I thought you might be interested to know\nthat, through some complicated horse-trading, he has finally gotten\nBABBITT for the Modern Library. I don’t begin to understand the\nconvolutions by which he was able to do this, but he thinks this time it\nwill stick” (Maule to Lewis, 1 August 1941). Lewis was “extremely glad”\n(Lewis to Maule, 12 August 1941). *Dodsworth* (348) became his third\ntitle in the series in 1947.\n\nThe ML edition of *Babbitt* sold 5,807 copies during the 18-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in October 1942 and\na third printing of 2,000 copies in March 1943.\n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace launched its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern\nClassics, for the burgeoning college market in 1948, it served notice\nthat it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for all of Lewis’s\ntitles in the ML (*Arrowsmith*, *Babbitt* and *Dodsworth*) as well as\nfive other Harcourt, Brace titles by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne\nPorter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,\nBrace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 4,000 copies of\n*Babbitt* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months\nfor the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948).\nThe Harbrace Modern Classics edition of *Babbitt*, printed from the same\nplates used by the ML, was published in 1950. *Dodsworth* was reprieved;\nit was never included in Harbrace Modern Classics and the Modern Library\nedition remained in print until 1970.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933–1952) *254*\n\nLewis, *Dodsworth* (1947–1970) *400*\n\nLewis, *Cass Timberlane* (1957–1970) *499*"

(*Fall 1954*)\n\nOriginally published by Harper & Bros., 1940, with an introduction by\nDorothy Canfield Fisher. The Harper plates were available to the ML but\nwere too large for its format; the ML edition was printed from plates\nmade from a new typesetting. Published March 1942. *WR* 14 March 1942.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.\n\nCerf expressed interest in a ML edition shortly after *Native Son* was\npublished (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 11 April 1940). Hoyns promised\nto talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted\nthat Grosset & Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright\nand for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied\nthat it should be possible for both Grosset & Dunlap and the ML to do\nthe book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on\nthese reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new\ntitles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit\nof everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940).\n\nThe following year Cerf wrote to Wright hoping to secure his support for\na ML edition. He indicated that he wanted to publish *Native Son* in\nspring 1942 and invited Wright to write an introduction if a ML edition\ncould be arranged (Cerf to Wright, 12 August 1941). Wright did not reply\nand Cerf wrote again on 3 September 1941. Wright does not appear to have\nreplied to this letter either. In the end the ML reprinted the Fisher\nintroduction from the Harper edition.\n\n*Native Son* sold 7,046 copies during the during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\nHarper’s informed the ML in 1956 that its College Department wanted to\ninclude *Native Son* and Richard Hughes’s *High Wind in Jamaica* (239)\nin Harper Modern Classics, a clothbound series aimed at the textbook\nmarket (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper’s, to Klopfer, 20 July 1956).\nHarper’s was willing to allow both titles to remain in the ML, but\nKlopfer decided to drop them when the stock on hand was exhausted.\n“They’re not strong enough titles to hang on in competition with your\nown cloth-bound edition” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956)."

Irwin\n> Edman, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, who is\n> responsible for the selection, contributes a brilliant Introductory\n> Essay. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published with Edman’s introductory essay by Charles\nScribner’s Sons, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Publication announced for November 1942 but published in\nSeptember. *WR* 26 September 1942. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1952.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939, but\nScribner’s does not appear to have been ready to authorize an\ninexpensive reprint (Whitney Darrow to Cerf, 17 July 1939). Three years\nlater the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of $1,000 against royalties of 5\ncents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased\nto 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available\nand in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format.\nScribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to\nrecover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman\nedited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional\npayment for the ML edition.\n\nThe suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came\ninitially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had edited *The Philosophy\nof William James* (119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former\nstudent of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James\nvolume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar\ncollection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the\nvolume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was\ninterested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than $250\n(Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926). Cerf told him to go ahead, then wrote\nthree months later to cancel the project, noting that he wanted the book\nbut was afraid that Scribner’s would not give the necessary permissions\n(Cerf to Kallen, 29 November 1926; Cerf to Kallen, 3 March 1927). That\nsummer Cerf indicated to Joseph Ratner, who had written on Santayana’s\nbehalf to inquire about progress on the project, that the collection was\nout of the question for the time being because of the large number of\npermissions that would have to be secured from Scribner’s. “We are\nconvinced that just as soon as we approached them on the subject they\nwould turn us down and proceed on such an anthology on their own . . .”\n(Ratner to Cerf, 8 June 1927; Cerf to Ratner, 11 August 1927).\nScribner’s published *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,405 copies by 1 November 1943. Scribner’s\npublished a new and greatly enlarged edition of *The Philosophy of\nSantayana* in 1953 and may have terminated the ML’s reprint contract in\nanticipation of the appearance of that edition.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSantayana, *Sense of Beauty* (1955–1970) 478"

When the ML edition finally appeared it sold 6,622\ncopies in its first year, but interest in Byrne was beginning to wane.\nAfter *Messer Marco Polo* had been in the series for four years, Cerf\nindicated that the sales records showed a steady decline. “Evidently\nByrne’s books don’t mean very much to readers of today” (Cerf to Alfred\nR.

Published February 1943. *WR* 13 March 1943.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple\nClassics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of *The\nImitation of Christ* is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M.\nDent, 1910). The text of *Religio Medici* probably derives from *The\nReligio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne* (Everyman’s\nLibrary, 1906).\n\nEdman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for\nhis work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000\nwords that would include discussions of the three individual works. When\nit arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind\nof introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the\nModern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).\n\nCerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of\nBoetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of\nChicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical\nLibrary was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new\none (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).\n\nJ. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland,\nnoted that *Religio Medici* was on the Index and warned that its\ninclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised\nusing a different translation of *The Imitation of Christ*. “If you\ncould use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a\nProtestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this\nwould make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio\nMedici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November\n1942).\n\nEckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his\nopinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the\nfact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough\nliterate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point\nof view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral\nviewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman\nto Commins, 11 November 1942).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943."

It mixes the great with the trivial; long\nstretches of it seem only pedantic categorizing; other stretches seem\nrather obvious. The whole is poorly proportioned and badly joined.\nBetween the oases of insight there are desert wastes of pedestrian\nanalysis.” Commins feared that the passage would discourage prospective\nreaders (Commins to Lerner, 25 November 1942); Lerner agreed and it was\nomitted.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,319 copies by 1 November 1943.\n\n#### 362b.

(*Spring 1944*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for November 1943. *WR* 30 October 1943. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from *The Complete Works\nof Shakespeare*, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904),\nand its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20\nvols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and\nOxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its\ntext publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text,\nCommins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the\nrequest that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to\nWilliam T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).\n\nAt least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the *New\nRepublic*, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very\nagreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be\ncongratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an\nomission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right\nto know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who\nhas done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer,\n“Editions of Shakespeare,” *New Republic*, 10 January 1944, p. 57).\n\nThe drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated\ngraphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the\n*Tragedies*, red for the *Comedies*, blue for the *Histories and\nPoems*). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis\nMiller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the\noriginal jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the\nsecond printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25\nAugust 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the\nproof stage:\n\n> The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare\n> jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present\n> a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is\n> altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.\n>\n> Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets,\n> so that while they are held together by a common thread of\n> recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have\n> its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely\n> that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I\n> continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in\n> other colors.\n>\n> I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I\n> ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam\n> Goldwyn, and give me what I want.\n\nThe length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML\nto keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World\nWar. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the\nfall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by\ndifferent jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the\nonly printings during the war.\n\nThe war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but\nit took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from\nwartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be\nthree or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted\nbecause of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to\nMr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation,\nwhich made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95\ncents and break even, was an additional complication.\n\nThe Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time\neach volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume\nset.\n\n#### 364b.

He\nwrote to Cerf, “It is impossible to do the Shakespeare in the Modern\nLibrary and break even so I have hit on the brilliant scheme of doing\nthe Comedies, Tragedies and Histories in two volumes each, numbered 1\nand 1A, 2 and 2A, 3 and 3A. I think we can produce 15,000 sets of these\nbooks for October 1st delivery. We can make our normal margin of profit\nand I think we can sell a good chunk of them this Fall. It will be years\nuntil we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the\nmeantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume\nsets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The\nprinting order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21\nMay 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July.\n\nEach volume was sold individually. An unfortunate result of splitting\nthe Shakespeare volumes was that the notes and glossary were in the\nsecond volume of each two-volume set.\n\n#### 364c.

All three Shakespeare volumes were projected for inclusion in\nthe Illustrated ML but only the *Tragedies* (IML 14) and *Comedies* (IML\n15) were published.\n\nThe numbering of the six Shakespeare volumes changed to ML 2–7 in fall\n1959 because new business machines acquired by Random House could not\nhandle number-letter combinations. The shift made it necessary to assign\nnew numbers to four other ML titles. *The Modern Library Dictionary*\n(509) moved from ML 4 to 1, Douglas’s *South Wind* (114) from ML 5 to\n304, Ibsen’s *Six Plays* (490) from ML 6 to 305, and *Wisdom of\nConfucius* (312) from ML 7 to 306.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nShakespeare, *The Tragedies of Shakespeare* (Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Comedies of Shakespeare* (1 vol., 1943–1947; 2 vols.\n1947–1971; Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Histories and Poems of Shakespeare* (1 vol.,\n1943–1947; 2 vols., 1947–1971)"

Publication announced for spring\n1944. *WR* 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1957.\n\nWatkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1929) included short stories, selections\nfrom novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and\nautobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories,\nessays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection\nrepresents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s\nNegro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the\nNegro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind\nabout his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp.\nxi–xii).\n\nFor poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have\nbeen published in this field: *Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro\nPoetry for Young Readers*, by Arna Bontemps; *Book of American Negro\nPoetry*, by James Weldon Johnson; *Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse\nby Negro Poets*, by Countee Cullen; *Negro Voices, An Anthology of\nContemporary Verse*, by Beatrice M. Murphy; *Negro Poets and Their\nPoems*, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from\nnovels he recommends “that the following novels be read: *Their Eyes\nWere Watching God*, by Zora N. Hurston; *Home to Harlem*, by Claude\nMcKay; *The Blacker the Berry*, by Wallace Thurman; *My Lives and How I\nLost Them*, by Countee Cullen; *These Low Gro*unds, by W. E. Turpin;\n*Blood on the Forge*, by William Attaway; *Black Thunder*, by Arna\nBontemps; *Native Son*, by Richard Wright, and *The White Face*, by Carl\nR. Offord” (p. xiii).\n\nKeneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to *The Negro\nCaravan*, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee\n(Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that *The Negro Caravan* has been\nhighly influential in establishing a canon of African-American\nliterature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that\nendures. He does not believe the same is true for the *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1944).

Discontinued 1 January 1953.\n\nThe Random House edition was out of print when Snow inquired about a ML\nreprint (Snow to Cerf, 10 November 1943). The original plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to\ndate. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly\nlegitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November\n1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive\nrewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the\noriginal text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense\nhere and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the\naddition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii).\n\nThe original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies.

In the vast literature of the nation’s\n> development no book so completely and comprehensively fulfills these\n> requirements as the work of Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager,\n> both professors of history at Columbia University. They have provided\n> for this edition a special section which brings their chronicle up to\n> the immediate present. (*Spring 1945*)\n\nOriginally published as *America: The Story of a Free People* by Little,\nBrown & Co., 1942; reprinted in paperback as *The Pocket History of the\nUnited States* (Pocket Books, 1943). ML edition printed from plates made\nfrom a new typesetting with an added chapter on “The Second World War”\n(pp. 493–511). Published February 1945. *WR* 24 February 1945.\n\nCerf initially expressed interest in adding a concise history of the\nUnited States to the ML in 1940. He wrote to Frank Monaghan, an\nassistant professor of history at Yale:\n\n> I am crazy to have a clear, concise and up-to-the-minute history of\n> the United States in our Modern Library and wonder if you would be\n> interested in discussing with me the possibility of either writing the\n> book yourself or at least collaborating on such a project.\n>\n> You will be amazed to hear that there is no such book on the market.\n> Thousands of refugees are clamoring for a short history of the\n> country, written without bias and not as a textbook, priced within\n> their reach. In addition, many thousands of native born Americans are\n> more interested in their country today than has ever been the case\n> before (Cerf to Monaghan, 30 October 1940).\n\nMonaghan was interested and described the book he envisioned: “It should\nhave the epic sweep and the implications of Beethoven and Wagner, the\nsalt and twang of a Woody Guthrie ballad. . . . It should be better than\nGreen’s *Short History of the English People*” (Monaghan to Cerf, 24\nNovember 1940). The contract, signed in February 1941, called for the\nmanuscript to be delivered by 1 July 1942. The book was to be published\ninitially as a Random House trade book followed by a ML edition. The\ncontract called for payment of up to $1,500 in expenses; Monaghan would\nreceive royalties for the trade edition at the standard sliding scale of\n10% of the list price for the first 2,500 copies, 12½% for the next\n2,500 copies, and 15% thereafter. Royalties for the ML edition would be\n10 cents a copy.\n\nCerf reported in May 1941 that the announcement of Monaghan’s book\n“caused more enthusiasm than any publicity release that was ever sent\nout from this office” (Cerf to Monaghan, 1 May 1941). In September\nMonaghan indicated that the book was half written (Monaghan to Cerf, 22\nSeptember 1941). Monaghan received an additional advance of $500 in\nSeptember 1942, but he had many other ongoing projects and the book was\nnever completed.\n\nCerf’s last letter to Monaghan was dated 2 September 1943:\n\n> At the time we discussed the project I remember begging you not to\n> take it on unless you were absolutely sure you could deliver. I\n> impressed upon you the fact that if you couldn’t do the book in time,\n> we would attempt to find somebody else who would.\n>\n> Obviously I made a colossal mistake in judgment when I entrusted this\n> book to you. Had you turned out nothing else since the time you signed\n> the contract, I could have understood your failure to live up to your\n> promise, but I have seen not only your work on Old New York, but that\n> lengthy manuscript on the History of the World that you brought us\n> yourself and that was obviously done on the time that you should have\n> spent finishing the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>\n> It seems to me that the least that you could have done was to tell us\n> that you couldn’t do the job as soon as you decided on taking up your\n> other work, thus giving us the opportunity of finding somebody else to\n> do what we wanted before other publishers beat us to the draw.\n>\n> I simply cannot understand dealings of this sort (Cerf to Monaghan, 2\n> September 1943).\n\nShortly before Cerf wrote his final letter to Monaghan, Klopfer, who was\nserving in the U.S. Air Force, wrote to Cerf suggesting “a small\nillustrated book of the documents of democracy and our own history.” He\nnoted that either Allan Nevins or Henry Steele Commager would do a fine\njob editing the volume (Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, in Cerf and\nKlopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p. 87).\n\nThe following month Cerf expressed interest in a ML edition of Nevins\nand Commager’s history, titled *America: The Story of a Free People* in\nits original edition and *The Pocket History of the United States* in\nthe paperback reprint (Pocket Books, February 1943). Cerf referred to it\nin *Saturday Review of Literature* as “the best short ‘History of the\nUnited States’ on the market” and noted that the Pocket Books edition\nhad sold half a million copies (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 14 August 1943, p.\n14).\n\nCerf offered Little, Brown a $2,500 advance for a ML edition, but Alfred\nMcIntyre, the president of Little, Brown, indicated that it was selling\ntoo well for a ML edition to be considered. In any case, he added,\nPocket Books controlled all rights to editions selling for less than two\ndollars (Cerf to McIntyre, Little, Brown & Co., 17 September 1943;\nMcIntyre to Cerf, 20 September 1943). Cerf’s next step was to offer\nPocket Books a $4,000 advance. Robert de Graff of Pocket Books promised\nto do what he could to secure Little, Brown’s approval (Cerf to\nCommager, 7 December 1943). It appears to have taken another six months\nfor everything to be settled. By June Cerf was asking Commager about an\nintroduction to the ML edition (Cerf to Commager, 20 June 1944). Klopfer\nindicated later that the ML’s contract was with Pocket Books and\nroyalties were paid to them (Klopfer to Knopf, 23 March 1962).\n\nSuccessive ML editions of *A Short History of the United States* sold\nover 100,000 copies prior to 1969. It sold 3,685 copies during November\n1951–October 1952, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles during this 12-month period.\n\n#### 376.1b.

It was 21 pages longer than 376.1a. The index, which\nwas also completely reset, increased in length by four pages.\n\nIn Chapter 3, “The Conquest of New France and the Movement for\nIndependence,” the sentence “The second era had for its most prominent\nfeature the missionary activity of a band of devoted men, representing\nthe Franciscans, the Recollects, the Ursulines, and above all the\nJesuits” (376.1a, p. 64, line 19), was changed to “activity of a band of\ndevoted people” (376.1b, p. 64, line 19). The change from “men” to\n“people” reflected the realization that the Ursulines were a teaching\norder of nuns.\n\nA revised Pocket Books edition containing the new chapter on the Second\nWorld War and additional revisions not in ML 376.1b was published in\nFebruary 1951, but it retained the reading “a band of devoted men”\n(Pocket Books, rev. ed., 1951, p. 59).\n\nThe “new enlarged edition” (376.2) published in the ML in 1956 was\nphotographically reproduced from the 1956 Pocket Books edition and\nreverts to the reading “a band of devoted men” (376.2, p. 59). The 5th\nedition of *A Short History of the United States* (Knopf, 1966), which\nwas reprinted in the ML in 1969, also retains the reading “a band of\ndevoted men” (376.3, p. 63)."

(*Fall 1946*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology; also published as *The Pocket Book of Western\nStories* by Pocket Books, Inc., 1945. ML edition published April 1945.\n*WR* 5 May 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\n*Great Tales of the American West* was a joint venture between the ML\nand Pocket Books, Inc. The Pocket Books edition, published in June 1945\nand printed from plates made from a different typesetting, ran to 320\npages, forty pages shorter than the ML edition. It omitted Robert\nEaston’s “To Find a Place” (ML ed., pp. 331–61) but the content of the\ntwo editions was otherwise identical. The composition and manufacturing\ncosts for each set of plates was split equally between Pocket Books and\nthe ML. Maule, a RH editor, received a $250 advance against royalties of\n3 cents a copy on the ML edition.\n\nHal Borland’s review of the ML edition in the *New York Times Book\nReview* noted the absence of Will James, Andy Adams, and B. M. Bower.\nMaule had tried to get something by James but the estate was tied up\nwith legal problems and had been unable to grant permission. Adams and\nBower wrote no short stories and Maule did not want to include\nselections from novels. In a letter to Borland he noted, “There is\nanother omission which we are correcting because the Modern Library\nfeels that the permanence of the volume justifies the trouble and\nexpense. Through a mix-up I failed to include a WOLFVILLE story by\nAlfred Henry Lewis but I am in touch with the estate now, and the next\nprinting will have one” (Maule to Borland, 3 July 1945).\n\nNo story by Lewis was ever included. The inflation that followed the\nSecond World War together with relatively slow sales of Maule’s\nanthology may have ruled out incurring additional costs for permissions,\ntypesetting, and plate making.\n\nUnlike *Great Modern Short Stories* (361) and *Best American Humorous\nStories* (380), *Great Tales of the American West* did not rank among\nthe 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month\nperiod, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n***Fall***"

First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued fall 1952.\n\nCharles Duell suggested a ML edition of Fast’s *Conceived in Liberty* in\n1942. Cerf responded that it wouldn’t have a chance in the ML but that\nFast’s recently published novel *The Unvanquished* would be a different\nmatter (Duell to Cerf, 18 December 1942; Cerf to Duell, 24 December\n1942). The reprint contract was signed two-and-a-half years later, in\nMay 1945.\n\nFour years after *The Unvanquished* was added to the ML, Fast contacted\nCerf about a rumor that the novel and his volume devoted to Tom Paine in\nML Giants (G69) were being dropped from the series. Fast had joined the\nCommunist Party in 1944 and in recent testimony before the House\nCommittee on Un-American Activities had refused to reveal the names of\ncontributors to a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish\nCivil War (“Howard Fast,” *Wikipedia*, accessed 27 July 2010). He wrote:\n\n> I do hope I am needlessly perturbed, but I thought it best to write\n> you and ask whether the rumor that my books have been dropped from the\n> Modern Library has any basis in fact. It came to me from several\n> places in the industry that you were cleaning people like myself out\n> of the Modern Library, and that two of the initial adjustments were\n> THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE.\n>\n> I don’t have to tell you that I find this most difficult to believe.\n> Whatever our political differences have been—and they have been very\n> considerable—I always considered you a person of independence and\n> integrity. I cannot believe that any circumstances would cause you to\n> give aid and comfort to the unspeakable group of people who both fear\n> and hate books, and attack them. (Fast to Cerf, 7 December 1949).\n\nCerf replied:\n\n> The rumor you quote in your letter of December 7th to the effect that\n> your books were going to be dropped from the Modern Library because\n> “we were cleaning people like yourself out of the series” is 100%\n> incorrect. I would be interested in learning where you heard this\n> rumor. . . .\n>\n> Your THE UNVANQUISHED and CITIZEN TOM PAINE were added to the Modern\n> Library because we believed they belonged there.

ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published summer 1945 (publication originally announced for\nfall 1944 and then for spring 1945). *WR* 4 August 1945. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nJames D. Hart, the author of the Foreword, had suggested a ML edition of\n*Two Years before the Mast* in 1935 and indicated that it would have a\nsteady sale to schools and colleges (Hart to Cerf, 19 February 1935).\nLater that year Cerf offered Hart $75 to write an introduction to the\nGrabhorn Press edition with the understanding that the introduction\ncould also be used in due course in a ML edition (Cerf to Hart, 12\nNovember 1935). Hart also advised Edwin and Robert Grabhorn about the\nbest edition to use as a copy-text when setting their edition.\n\nHart stated in his introduction to the Grabhorn edition, “The text for\nthis edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life, and to it is\nadded the chapter of reminiscences he wrote ‘twenty-four years after.’\nTo this have been added the concluding chapter of the first edition,\nomitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the\noriginal purpose of his account” (p. \\[xiv\\]). The second sentence is\naltered in ML ed. as follows: “To this have been added the preface and\nepilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but\ninteresting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p.\n\\[xiv\\]). The preface appears in both the Grabhorn and ML editions; the\nepilogue (titled “Concluding Memorandum” in the Grabhorn edition)\nappears on pp. 413–23 of the ML edition as part of “Twenty-four Years\nAfter.” The concluding chapter referred to in Hart’s introduction to the\nGrabhorn edition is omitted from 381a. The ML edition also omitted the\npenultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding\nchapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided\nincorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the\nevents as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I\nshall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have\nbeen suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4).\n\nThe film of *Two Years before the Mast* starring Alan Ladd was released\nby Paramount Pictures in April 1945. It is possible that publication of\nthe ML edition was postponed to coincide with the release of the film.\n\nThe last paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381a reads as follows:\n\n> The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his\n> life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote\n> “twenty-four years after.” To this have been added the preface and the\n> epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but\n> interesting as showing the original purpose of his account.

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf authorized Commins to prepare a volume of Irving’s writings for the\nML in August 1944. Commins was to provide an introduction, and the\nlength of the book was to be no more than 700 pages. Commins submitted a\npreliminary table of contents about seven weeks later, noting that he\nproposed to include Irving’s burlesque *History of New York* by Diedrich\nKnickerbocker in complete form. “First, it’s the best thing he wrote and\nhis greatest fame rests on it. Second, and very important, it is a\nwonderful selling point to be able to say that we give the History\ncomplete and unabridged. . . . The History is hard to get outside\nconventional sets of Irving.” Commins received a $250 advance against\nroyalties of 3 cents for every copy sold in the ML (Cerf to Commins, 17\nAugust 1944, Commins to Cerf, 5 October 1944; Saxe Commins Papers, Box\n2, Princeton University Library).\n\nCerf announced the forthcoming publication of *Selected Writings of\nWashington Irving* in his “Trade Winds” column six months before the\nbook was published. He stated, “The editors of the Modern Library expect\nit to be one of the most popular volumes in the entire series” (“Trade\nWinds,” *SRL*, 12 May 1945, p. 17).\n\nJacket B was printed in four instead of six colors and appears to have\nbeen introduced in 1947 or early 1948. Ray Freiman asked Nat Farmer, the\nartist responsible for the original ML jacket, to devise a color scheme\nutilizing four colors, indicating that the ML could not afford six-color\nprinting in 1947 (Freiman to Farmer, 9 May 1947).\n\n*Selected Writings of Washington Irving* was not among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952."

They were\nunable to complete the volume, perhaps because Sussman’s advertising\nagency was reorganized in 1944 from Franklin Spier & Aaron Sussman to\nSussman & Sugar. Commins took over the editing of the volume and\nreceived a flat fee of $300 for his efforts—the same amount that had\nbeen offered to Sussman and Burnet (Cerf to Commins, 26 January 1945;\nSaxe Commins Papers, Princeton University Library).\n\nCommins used the anonymous translations in *The Life and Work of Henri\nRene Guy de Maupassant* (17 vols., M. W.

The\nsculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English early in 1940, was\nKoestler’s companion and lover. Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris\nseparately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once\nshe was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of *Darkness at\nNoon* with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August\n2013).\n\nCerf initially wanted to publish *Darkness at Noon* in the ML in fall\n1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I\nthink it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do\nwell with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12\nJanuary 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for\nfall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on\nthe grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our\nrelations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam,\nMacmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML\nedition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of\n10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).\n\n*Darkness at Noon* was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club\nfor June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years\nlater, the ML jacket stated “*The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection*”; in\nthe early 1950s the wording was changed to “*A Book-of-the-Month Club\nSelection*”.\n\n*Darkness at Noon* sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles."

In a brilliant new Foreword, especially\n> written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his\n> faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world.\n> (*Spring 1946*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp.\n\\[1\\]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. *WR* 27\nApril 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nThe ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a\ncopy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in\n1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf,\nInc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A\nPocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.\n\nHersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in\nplace of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar\nrather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:\n\n> For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began:\n> “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It\n> is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”\n>\n> On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent\n> of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in\n> this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of\n> September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military\n> Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than\n> average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was\n> just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two\n> things.\n>\n> One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus\n> one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication\n> to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of\n> peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .\n>\n> The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was\n> a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our\n> citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the\n> military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter\n> how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never\n> forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men,\n> when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones,\n> when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute\n> control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn\n> on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every\n> other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative\n> talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).\n\nCommins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever\nto appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November\n1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in\nthe Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not\n“consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere\nelse” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf\nedition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint\neditions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more\nthan thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.\n\nCopies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of\nthe volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and\njacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author\nstamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and\ntitle printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is\nindicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used\non ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as\nregular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for\nthe use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.\n\nThe ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952."

(*Spring 1946*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for February 1946. *WR* 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably\n10,000 copies.\n\nCerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about including *The Adventures\nand Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* in the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance\nagainst royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10\ncents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and\nmake new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a\nway of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27\nApril 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred\nCerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle\nEstate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being\ndifficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a\nperiod of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible\nlimitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes\nstories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).\n\nKlopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with\nWatt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped\nits proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a\nthree-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt\nto drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML\nwould be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer,\n4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is\nincluded in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, pp. 195–98).\nHe also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was\nconsidering putting *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* into\nthe Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that,\nalthough the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years\nand he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at\nten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed\nto a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five\nyears.\n\nVincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the\nML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I\nwould rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of\nthe American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty\ncorrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was\npublished without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a\nfirst printing of 10,000 copies.\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock\nHolmes* high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n#### 387b.

First printing: Not ascertained but probably 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1969/70.\n\nThe ML paid Scribner’s a $400 advance against royalties of 8 cents a\ncopy. The small advance and relatively low royalty rate reflected the\nassumption on the part of both Scribner’s and the ML that *The Wings of\nthe Dove* did not have wide popular appeal and was unlikely to achieve\nlarge reprint sales.\n\nJames’s Preface (pp. v–xxii) originally appeared in the New York Edition\nof *The Novels and Tales of Henry James* (New York: Charles Scribner’s\nSons, 1907–17), in which *The Wings of the Dove* occupied vols. 19–20.\nThe New York edition appears to have been printed from standing type.\nThe ML reset the Preface in the typographic style of the 1902 Scribner’s\nedition and made plates that were used for ML printings.\n\nFour years before *The Wings of the Dove* was added to the ML, Cerf\nadmitted to Max Perkins that he was unable to get through the book (Cerf\nto Perkins, 26 May 1942). In his “Trade Winds” column he wrote,\n“According to rumor David Selznick is toying with a notion of making a\nmotion-picture version of the Henry James novel, ‘The Wings of the\nDove,’ and Max Perkins of Scribner’s suggested that the book might make\na timely addition to the Modern Library series. We regret to report,\nhowever, that we bogged down completely after sixty pages or so. This is\none of James’s later novels, and its style is more involved than\nFaulkner’s ‘Sound and the Fury’ or Isabel Paterson’s political\ndissertations” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, June 20, 1942, p. 20).\n\n*The Wings of the Dove* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the 12-month period, November 1952–October 1952. In\ncontrast, James’s *Portrait of a Lady* (1936) was solidly in the first\nquarter of ML titles, and *Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master*\n(1930) was near the top of the second quarter."

Brown of Cornell University suggested that the ML needed a volume\nof Balzac in addition to *Droll Stories* (221), which he considered\nunrepresentative. “You have Stendhal, Flaubert and Maupassant, why not\nBalzac?” (Brown to Cerf, 26 March 1943). Cerf commissioned him to\nmodernize existing English translations of *Père Goriot* and *Eugénie\nGrandet* and to write an introduction. Brown agreed to a fee of $300 and\npromised the manuscript within five months (Cerf to Brown, 25 August\n1943). Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the\nBalzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the\nlibrary which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four\nmonths later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were\nneeded (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the\nexisting translations were probably very bad and favored doing new\ntranslations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we\npay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to\nadvertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February\n1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should\ntell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this\npoint Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown,\n10 February 1944).\n\nBrown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed\nwork on the translation of *Eugénie Grandet*. In December he suggested\nJohn Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4\nDecember 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent $300 each to Brown and Watkins.\nThe financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and\nBrown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that $500\nwould be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he\ninitially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being\nunreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually\naccepted the $300 fee.\n\n*Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November\n1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 390b.

Brown inserted three paragraphs of biographical information after\nthe opening paragraph of the introduction. The additions to the\nintroduction extended its length by a page, and the bibliography\noccupied an additional two pages. By using the blank page that followed\nthe introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96\noccupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to\nincorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length\nof the volume. The title page was completely reset, and Brown’s\nintroduction was credited for the first time on the title page.\n\nBrown also supplied a list of errors and misprints that appeared on\neight pages of the text. The plates were patched to correct the errors."

His\nprogram notes about works being performed were included in the printed\nprograms, and his editorial correspondence with Saxe Commins was on\nBoston Symphony Orchestra letterhead. Random House published Burk’s\n*Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography* in 1940. Shortly thereafter Cerf\nand Commins asked him to write a life of Beethoven for the ML. Commins\nsuggested that three-fourths of the book should be biographical and\none-fourth should consist of program notes on each of Beethoven’s works\n(Commins to Burk, 31 March 1941). The book was published initially by\nRandom House and was reprinted in the ML three years later. For the ML\nedition Burk received royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000\ncopies and 10 cents a copy thereafter.\n\n*The Life and Works of Beethoven* was not among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952. It sold about 2,000 copies a year in the mid-1950s;\nCerf reported in 1960 that it sold “only moderately well” (Cerf to\nSelden Rodman, 8 June 1960).\n\nBurk indicated that his typescript was almost exactly 100,000 words and\nthat his first choice of someone to write an introduction was Aaron\nCopeland, with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony,\nas another possibility (Burk to Commins, 13 July 1942 and 27 November\n1942; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 2, Princeton University Library).

Discontinued spring 1963.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in\n1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later\nRobert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the\nyear, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated\nthat the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000\nadvance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid\nfor and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write\nan introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944).\nIt took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the\ndelay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan\nconveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include\nevery poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of\nFrost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and\nPocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). *The Pocket Book of\nRobert Frost’s Poems* was published in 1946 and *The Complete Poems of\nRobert Frost* (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern\nLibrary contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500\nadvance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract\nwas for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless\nterminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.\n\nLinscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in *The\nCollected Poems of Robert Frost* (Holt, 1939) and *A Witness Tree*\n(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott\nto Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided\nthat he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four\nof the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had\nleft out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to\nMr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by\nway of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but\ninstead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13\nDecember 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four\npoems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The\nMountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter\nNight,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue\nRibbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking\nwith Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the\ncontents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only\n“The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection.\nLinscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages\n(Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The\nConstant Symbol,” was also published in *Atlantic Monthly* (October\n1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost\nappended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.\n\n*The Poems of Robert Frost* sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\nNo details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been\nascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt,\nRinehart & Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in\n1963."

(*Spring 1963*)\n\n*The Sound and the Fury* originally published by Jonathan Cape and\nHarrison Smith, 1929; *As I Lay Dying* originally published by Jonathan\nCape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from\na new typesetting. Published November 1946. *WR* 7 December 1946. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by\nseparate ML editions of *The Sound and the Fury* (1966) and *As I Lay\nDying* (1967).\n\nFaulkner’s *Sanctuary* (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only\nFaulkner title in the series until the addition of *The Sound and the\nFury & As I Lay Dying* fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a\nRandom House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith\nand Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave\nRandom House publishing rights to *The Sound and the Fury* (1929), *As I\nLay Dying* (1930), *Sanctuary* (1931), *Light in August* (1932), and\n*Pylon* (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread\ncritical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s\nsubsequent works, including *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936), *The\nUnvanquished* (1938), *The Wild Palms* (1939), *The Hamlet* (1940), and\n*Go Down, Moses* (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s\nnovels except *Soldier’s Pay* (Boni & Liveright, 1926), *Mosquitoes*\n(Boni & Liveright, 1927) and *Sartoris* (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it\ntook ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf\nand Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML.\n\nFaulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published *The\nPortable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published *The\nSound and the Fury* & *As I Lay Dying* in a single volume. The two\nvolumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of\nFaulkner’s stature in the United States.\n\nEvelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and\nRobert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been\ninterested in publishing a ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* or *As\nI Lay Dying* in the early 1930s but took *Sanctuary* instead because\nplates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles\n(Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and\n1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a\nsecond printing than to make plates—and plates were available for\n*Sanctuary*.\n\nLinscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint\nof *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (Linscott to Cowley, 31\nDecember 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider *As I Lay Dying*\nto be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way\nbelow” *Light in August*. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the\ntwo works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see *The\nSound and the Fury* and *Light in August* reprinted separately. He\ncontinued:\n\n> Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The\n> Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he\n> tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I\n> don’t think that’s such a good idea either. \\[In its list for fall and\n> winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited\n> edition of *The Sound and the Fur*y with the text in three colors and\n> a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.\\] But\n> for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson\n> family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in\n> TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix?\n> (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946).\n\nCowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley\nthat the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to\nwrite an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945\nThe Compsons” that Faulkner had written for *The Portable Faulkner*.\nCowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing\npermission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on:\n\n> Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing\n> Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,”\n> having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he\n> says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel.\n> His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has\n> some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if\n> they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the\n> Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the\n> novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he\n> has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys\n> at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow—\n> either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or\n> else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer,\n> because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or\n> else hijack a copy from some friend.\n>\n> I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at\n> writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the\n> Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the\n> critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the\n> author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack\n> \\[*sic*\\], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it\n> carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction\n> more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a\n> short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention\n> among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s\n> not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business\n> \\[see G68\\]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway\n> (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a\n> lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own\n> choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul\n> Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges\n> Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux,\n> perhaps, now writing in any language. . . .\n>\n> I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to\n> start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from\n> questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing\n> with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too\n> much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not\n> enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels.\n> I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better\n> picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too,\n> under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are\n> planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of\n> money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on\n> it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot\n> to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an\n> end paper \\[paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as\n> a frontispiece\\]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and\n> shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an\n> unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising\n> appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the\n> way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books\n> beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with\n> the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry.\n>\n> I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book \\[*The Portable\n> Faulkner*\\]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will\n> agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 \\[i.e., 1946\\];\n> underlining in original).\n\nLinscott replied:\n\n> I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not\n> only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants\n> it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . .\n>\n> I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is\n> a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think\n> it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to\n> write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he\n> has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back.\n>\n> Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable\n> will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will\n> help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more\n> likely to want to read the other.\n>\n> On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY\n> DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than\n> THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott\n> to Cowley, 15 February 1946).\n\nIn the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The\nML printed his Appendix from *The Portable Faulkner* with minor\nrevisions, placing it at the beginning of *The Sound and the Fury*,\nreferring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by\nthe author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was\nsuperseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of *The Sound\nand the Fury* (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume\n(pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four\nnovels (*Soldiers’ Pay*, *Mosquitoes*, *Flags in the Dust*, and *The\nSound and the Fury*), published in 2006, also prints the appendix\n“Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of *The Sound and the Fury* (pp.\n1127–41).\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* sold 10,640 copies during the\ntwelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh\nbest-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title\nin the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American\nwriter and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind\nMaugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more\nthan 10,000 copies at this period:\n\n> Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930) 11,563\n>\n> Aquinas, *Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas* (1948) 11,129\n>\n> Aristotle, *Introduction to Aristotle* (1947) 11,114\n>\n> Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (Giant, 1931) 11,111\n>\n> Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 10,943\n>\n> Freud, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1938) 10,669\n>\n> Faulkner, *Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (1946) 10,640\n>\n> Plato, *Works of Plato* (1930) 10,302\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was almost the ML’s sixth\nbest-selling title. *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* outsold the\nFaulkner volume by twenty-nine copies.\n\nFaulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years\nafter the publication of *The Portable Faulkner* and the ML edition of\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*."

It is a cure for nearly\n> everything that ails a melancholy world. The knife of Perelman’s wit\n> and wisdom is sharpened on the boot of satire. The incomparable\n> parodist, he takes a cut at books, advertising, magazines, publishers,\n> the movies, columnists, socialites and even himself—and they are\n> \\[+all\\] the better for his keen scalpel and deft hand. Perelman is at\n> his best in this book of fifty \\[+hilarious\\] pieces, each one\n> warranted \\[+as a tonic to your sense of humor and guaranteed\\] to\n> keep you healthy with laughter. (*Spring 1947*) \\[*Spring 1957*\\]\n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1944, as *Crazy Like a Fox*. ML\nedition (pp. 3–269) printed from RH plates with minor revisions\nsuggested by Perelman, running heads omitted, dedication to Robert C.\nBenchley added, and the table of contents reset in the style of the\nRandom House edition to reflect the addition of the introduction and\nfour stories on pp. 270–300. Page numerals (vii–viii) were added to the\nreset table of contents. Publication announced for January 1947. *WR* 10\nMay 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\nReprinted (pp. \\[v\\]–xiv, 3–300) in Vintage Books, May 1973, using\noffset lithographic plates photographically reduced from the ML edition,\nwith title, half title, and fly title reverting to *Crazy Like a Fox*.\n\nThe ML paid Perelman royalties of 10 cents a copy, double the rate\nspecified for a ML reprint in the Random House contract (Perelman to\nCerf, 22 September 1946). Perelman wrote a new introduction for the ML\nedition under the name “Sidney Namlerep” and sent four additional\npieces: “Physician, Steel Thyself,” “Pale Hands I Loathe,” “Insert Flap\n‘A’ and Throw Away,” and “Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer.” He hoped that\nthe additional pieces could be inserted within the text rather than\nadded at the end but recognized that that might not be possible since\n*Crazy Like a Fox* plates were being used. He also asked to change the\ndedication from “For Laura and Abby Laura” (his wife and daughter) to\n“To Robert C. Benchley” (Perelman to Klopfer, 2 December 1946). The\ndedication in the Random House edition was printed on the verso of the\ntitle page; the dedication to Benchley in the Modern Library edition\nappeared on a leaf of its own.\n\nPerelman suggested McKnight Kauffer as the jacket designer for the ML\nedition. Five years earlier, after meeting with Saxe Commins in\nconnection with his forthcoming book *The Dream Department* (Random\nHouse, 1943), he commented, “On the way out after leaving you, I looked\nat some of McKnight Kauffer’s jackets for Modern Library titles. He’s\nwonderful; I really would love to have him do a jacket for the book if\nit could be arranged” (Perelman to Commins, “Tuesday” \\[6 October\n1942\\]). Kauffer designed the jackets for *The Dream Department* and the\nRandom House trade edition of *Crazy Like a Fox* as well as the jacket\nfor the ML edition.\n\nPerelman also emphasized that it was important to proofread *Crazy Like\na Fox* carefully, and he asked for several changes in the text, of which\nthe most notable was changing “total recall” to “O’Hara’s disease” (p.\n53). Other changes included changing “rif ling” to “riffling” (p. 47),\n“jack boots” to “jackboots” (p. 88), and “compound fracture” to\n“greenstick fracture” (p. 184).\n\nNegotiations concerning the publication of *The Best of S. J. Perelman*\nbetween Cerf and Perelman’s agent, Alan Collins of Curtis Brown, Ltd.,\nwere not harmonious. Prior to publication Cerf wrote Collins: “I would\nlike to state here very clearly that we will carry out our contract for\nthe Perelman anthology in the Modern Library and that, thereafter, we\nhave not the faintest interest in future writings by Mr. Perelman” (Cerf\nto Collins, 18 November 1946).\n\nRandom House published five books by Perelman between 1937 and 1946. His\nnext book was published by Reynal & Hitchcock; thereafter he settled\ninto a long-term publishing relationship with Simon & Schuster."

(*Fall\n1961*) *Note:* There are two versions of the jacket, one with the\ndesigner’s name RIKI on the deep orange yellow panel, the other without\nthe designer’s name. The earliest noted without the designer’s name\ndates from 1957. Some later printings of the jacket include the\ndesigner’s name, others omit it.\n\nOriginal ML collection drawn from *The Basic Works of Aristotle*, ed.\nRichard McKeon (Random House, 1941). All of the translations were\noriginally published by Oxford University Press. Publication announced\nfor January 1947. *WR* 12 April 1947. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nMcKeon edited the *Basic Works of Aristotle* without a contract and was\nunhappy with the financial arrangements he was offered when it was\ncompleted. He had undertaken the collection hoping that it could be\npublished as a ML Giant and was prepared to accept a flat fee of $500 if\nit was published in an inexpensive format suitable for classroom use. “I\nmade it abundantly clear, in conversation,” he wrote later, “that in the\nevent that a larger price was to be charged for the volume, I would\nconsent to do it only on the basis of a continuing royalty payment”\n(McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). He was informed after he submitted the\nmanuscript that it could not be published as a Giant, and Cerf rejected\nthe royalty rate he suggested (5 percent on the first 3,500 copies\nrising to 12½ percent on sales over 10,000 copies). McKeon eventually\nagreed to an arrangement that limited his earnings to $1,250 (McKeon to\nCommins, ibid.).\n\nWhen Cerf invited him to compile a shorter collection of Aristotle’s\nwritings for the ML, McKeon insisted on a contract before beginning\nwork. He wrote Cerf, “If you had asked me to do the small Aristotle\nbefore the months of battling with Saxe \\[Commins\\] about the larger\nAristotle, I should probably have told you it couldn’t be done. After\nthat experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me,\ntherefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the\nonly thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would\nseem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more\nconcretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you\npropose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold\nannual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945).\nThe terms of the contract have not been ascertained, but McKeon\ndescribed the royalty he received on sales of *Introduction to\nAristotle* as “meager” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947).\n\n*Introduction to Aristotle* established itself as a textbook and became\none of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period from\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,114 copies, making it the ML’s\nthird best-selling title and one of eight titles (including Giants) with\nannual sales exceeding 10,000 copies.\n\nWhen the ML edition was declared out of print McKeon sought a reversion\nof rights so that *Introduction to Aristotle* could be published by the\nUniversity of Chicago Press. Random House agreed to his request,\noverlooking the fact that the collection was still in print in the\npaperbound series Modern Library College Editions. Klopfer admitted,\n“Nobody thought of the Modern Library College Edition until we had\ncommitted ourselves. . . . There wouldn’t have been a chance of\nreverting any rights to you if we hadn’t overlooked the MLCE” (Klopfer\nto Morris Philipson, University of Chicago Press, 2 October 1972). The\nreversion was limited to hardcover rights.\n\nThe University of Chicago Press published its edition of *Introduction\nto Aristotle* in 1973. Described as a “second edition, revised and\nenlarged,” it included a new general introduction and new introductions\nto each work. In addition to the contents of the ML edition, it included\n*De Partibus Animalium* (On the Parts of Animals), Book I, Chapter 1,\nand *Rhetorica* (Rhetoric), Book I, Chapters 1–4 and Book II, Chapters\n18–22. The format was 3/16 inch taller than the 7½ inch format the ML\nwas then using. The volume was perfect bound rather than sewn, and it\nwas bound in thin paper-covered boards—technically a hardcover under the\nterms of the contract, but for practical purposes as close as possible\nto a paperback.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nAristotle, *Politics* (1943– ) 362\n\nAristotle, *Rhetoric; Poetics* (1954– ) 469"

The ML tried to secure\nreprint rights in 1941, but negotiations with Harcourt, Brace were\nunsuccessful. Lewis then suggested *Elmer* *Gantry*, which apparently\nwould have been available, but Cerf thought that any of his major works\nwould be preferable (Lewis to Maule, 26 June 1941; Maule memo to Cerf,\n27 June 1941; Maule to Lewis, 8 July 1941). Five years later Cerf\napproached Harcourt, Brace again, pointing out that Lewis was anxious to\nhave *Dodsworth* in the series (Cerf to Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace,\n6 September 1946). This time he was successful, and the ML secured U.S.\nand Canadian reprint rights.\n\n#### 400b.

First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.\n\nPegis states in the Preface: “The present volume represents selections\nof materials, drawn entirely from *Basic Writings of St. Thomas\nAquinas*, which Random House published in 1945. . . . I have not made my\nselections with an eye to the opinions of specialists; I have aimed at\nmeeting what seemed to me the needs of the college student who is a\nbeginner in St. Thomas. Such a student will find in this book St.\nThomas’ mature views of the most crucial questions of natural theology,\npsychology, theory of knowledge and ethics” (p. vii).\n\n*Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas* was widely adopted in Catholic\ncolleges as a textbook for philosophy courses, and it became one of the\nML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952 it sold 11,129 copies, making it the second\nbest-selling title in the series and one of five ML titles with annual\nsales exceeding 10,000 copies. Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (199) outsold\nAquinas by 434 copies; *Introduction to Aristotle* (396) trailed Aquinas\nby fifteen copies. Pegis later indicated that *Introduction to St.\nThomas Aquinas* consistently sold 15,000–18,000 copies a year and had\nbecome “unexpectedly a textbook. . . . No one planned it this way, and\ncertainly no one anticipated such an unusual eventuality. But, what is\nworse, the *Introduction* is an improperly organized textbook since it\nwas never edited with such a teaching purpose in view; it was simply\norganized as a representative collection of Thomistic readings from\n*Basic Writings*. As a textbook, the *Introduction* needs a wider range\nof selections, introductions in the fields of instruction involved,\nnotes, bibliographies and both subject and author indices” (Pegis to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963).\n\nPegis suggested a revised edition prepared specifically for the textbook\nmarket as early as 1951. Part of his concern seems to have been to\nsecure better financial terms for himself, but no one at Random House\nwanted to take such a successful title out of the ML (Klopfer to Pegis,\n5 December 1951). Pegis was still talking about a textbook edition in\n1963. At that time he noted that the market would be expanding sharply\nas the baby boom generation entered Catholic colleges and proposed\nturning *Introduction to Aquinas* into a textbook selling at five or six\ndollars with a normal royalty of 10 to 15 percent of the list price. He\nalso offered to prepare a shorter and more general volume titled *The\nAquinas Papers* to replace *Introduction to Aquinas* in the ML (Pegis to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963).\n\nEpstein saw no point in scrapping the ML’s plates for *Introduction to\nAquinas* (Epstein memo to Klopfer, 14 August 1963). Pegis then suggested\nraising the list price from $1.95 to $2.45 and increasing his royalty to\n10 percent (Pegis to Klopfer, 27 August 1963). Epstein countered with an\noffer of a 5 percent royalty based on a list price of $2.45—the retail\nprice of ML books was in the process of increasing to $2.45 in any\ncase—and Pegis accepted (Pegis to Klopfer, 10 October 1963)."

Now, through the co-operation of her original publishers, we\n> are able to offer the passionate and mystical verses of one of the\n> most original and appealing poets in the entire history of American\n> letters. The romantic circumstances under which Emily Dickinson became\n> a hermit and guarded her poems against publication during her lifetime\n> are now a legend; her poems themselves are the real and lasting\n> expression of her incomparable intensity and delicacy. (*Fall 1948*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1948. *WR* 23 October 1948. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a ML edition of Dickinson’s poetry in\n1937, offering Little, Brown a $1,500 advance against royalties. At that\ntime all of Dickinson’s poems were protected by copyright, and Little,\nBrown rejected the offer. Alfred R. McIntyre, the firm’s president,\nwrote: “You have made a good offer, but it does not change our views.\nThis is a very valuable property and we are afraid that, though our\nsales might not fall off tremendously, they would fall off enough so\nthat we should not gain by the transaction.” He noted that Little,\nBrown’s share of the advance would be $750 (the other half would go to\nthe Dickinson estate) and that if it took five years for sales of the ML\nedition to cover the advance, Little, Brown’s income would only be $150\na year—and that a very small decline in sales would erase the firm’s\nprofit (McIntyre to Cerf, 26 May 1937).\n\nBy 1948, when the ML was able to negotiate reprint rights, Little,\nBrown’s situation had changed but the ML was still unable to get\neverything it wanted. *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson*, published in\nthe ML in October 1948, consisted of Dickinson’s *Poems* (1890), *Poems:\nSecond Series* (1891), and a selection from *Poems: Third Series*\n(1896). The three books, originally published by Roberts Brothers, had\nbeen published by Little, Brown & Co. since 1898, when it absorbed\nRoberts Brothers.\n\nThe first two volumes entered the public domain in 1946 and 1947, and\nthe third would enter the public domain in 1952. The ML had hoped to\nbase its edition on Dickinson’s *Poems: Centenary Edition* (Little,\nBrown, 1930), which included poems from two subsequent volumes. Little,\nBrown flatly refused to allow the ML to base its selection on the\nCentenary Edition. The ML wanted a more comprehensive collection than\nthe poems already in the public domain since World Publishing Co. was\nbringing out a volume of Dickinson’s public domain poems in their Living\nLibrary series. Little, Brown finally gave the ML permission to include\npoems from the first three volumes provided not more than a third of the\ntotal came from *Poems: Third Series* (Linscott to Conrad Aiken, 31\nMarch 1948 and 5 April 1948). This stipulation required the omission of\ntwenty-one poems from *Poems: Third Series*.\n\nAiken had repeatedly urged the ML to reprint his *Selected Poems of\nEmily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924). When the arrangements\nwith Little, Brown were made Linscott wrote him, “Since this looks like\na very simple editorial job, Bennett has suggested that I make the\nselection. It seemed to me that we might be able to use the Introduction\nyou did for the English edition (or perhaps a revised version) on\npayment of a comparatively small fee. The reason for this parsimony is\nthat we have to pay a heavy royalty to Little Brown which leaves us\nlittle or no editorial margin” (Linscott to Aiken, 31 March 1948).\n\nAiken, who had clashed with the ML three years earlier over the removal\nof poems by Ezra Pound from *An Anthology of Famous English and American\nPoetry* (G68), which he edited with William Rose Benét, responded:\n\n> “What’s this, another Trojan Horse? another case of “dona ferentes”,\n> as when Saxe \\[Commins\\] told me of the marvelously easy way I could\n> make $250 without a stroke of work, all by just letting him use my\n> comprehensive anthology with Bill Benet’s book to make a Giant—and\n> little aiken \\[*sic*\\] to get no royalty, while the Giant proceeded to\n> blanket the sales of the Modern Library edition???? As I’ve written\n> Bernice \\[Baumgarten, Aiken’s agent\\], for fifteen years or longer\n> I’ve repeatedly been urging the use of my Selected ED in the Modern\n> Library, and this little manoeouvre \\[*sic*\\] doesn’t, from where I’m\n> sitting, look either pretty or generous—nor <u>very</u> much like the\n> magnanimity one expects from an old friend (Aiken to Linscott, 2 April\n> 1948; underlining in original).\n\nLinscott replied that little editing was involved since the ML wanted to\nuse as many poems as possible and only a handful of poems had be omitted\nfrom the third volume (Linscott to Aiken, 5 April 1948).\n\nThere were significant differences between the ML volume and Aiken’s\n1924 anthology. The ML edition presents 426 of Dickinson’s poems in four\nsequences (“Life,” “Nature,” “Love,” and “Time and Eternity”). Aiken’s\nanthology included 220 poems with each poem printed on a separate page.\nThe ML numbered the poems within each sequence. Aiken had given them\ntitles.\n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 6 cents a copy. Aiken was\npacified with a payment of $1,000 for the use of his introduction to\n*Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* (London: Jonathan Cape, 1924), which\nhe revised for the ML. The revisions included correcting his reference\nin the first paragraph to T. W. Higginson as “editor of the *Atlantic\nMonthly* at that time” (Cape edition, pp. 5–6) to “essayist and\ncontributor to the *Atlantic Monthly*” (ML edition, p. vii–viii).\n\nSales through spring 1958 totaled 36,631 copies; annual sales for the\nthree-year period May 1955–April 1958 showed steady growth as follows:\n4,066 (1955–56), 5,141 (1956–57), and 5,246 (1957–58). Bonnell and\nBonnell (p. 112) report a seventeenth printing of 7,000 copies in 1963\nand seven printings “since then” totaling 25,500 copies.\n\n*Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson* has remained one of the most readily\navailable editions of Dickinson’s poetry for most of the period since\nits publication. It survived the 1970s, when Random House slashed\nhundreds of titles from the Modern Library, and remained in print into\nthe 1980s. The contents, based on the copyright status of Dickinson’s\npoems in 1948, remained unchanged throughout this period. It was only in\n1996, after Random House revived the Modern Library, that the twenty-one\npoems omitted from the original edition were added. By this time they\nhad been in the public domain for forty-four years. The only other\ndifferences between the content of the original ML edition and the reset\n1996 version were the replacement of Aiken’s introduction with an\nunsigned biographical note by Billy Collins and the welcome addition of\nan index of first lines."

Hazlitt\\]\n> translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of\n> Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and\n> modernized collection in language that retains the substance and\n> conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay\n> form. (*Fall 1949; \\[Spring 1956\\]*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published\nfall 1949. *WR* 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nMontaigne’s *Essays* had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first\nin the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford\nUniversity Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation,\nand the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was\nexhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to\nthink about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates\nas editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright\nprotection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and\nquite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947).\nHe then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern\nLibrary Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged.\nThe archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced\nit with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United\nStates. Because there was some question of British rights, we\nvoluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search\nof a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only\navailable ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four\nvolumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and\ncomparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29\nSeptember 1947).\n\nBates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century\ntranslation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the\npublic domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or\nreadability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the\nHazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at\nleast a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The\ncontract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely\nto Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you\ndeem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the\noriginal and to give the best possible modern rendering.”\n\nBates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt\ntranslation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the\nEditor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised\nit, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to\nthe accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to\nmodernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the\ntranslation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text\nstand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do\nconsiderable revising of the translation” (p. \\[vii\\]). Bates did not\nconsider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement\n“completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of\nthe title page be omitted.\n\nThe manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have\nbeen delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his\neditorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.\n\nBates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included\nthe essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion\nof sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain\nin language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one\nof the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and\nquotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed.\nIf you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to\nCommins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in\nfact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or,\nif included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).\n\n#### 419b.

(*Fall 1960*)\n\nIn 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern\nLibrary College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a\nlist of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently\ncut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not\ninclude the publication of this book in the College Editions within the\nnear future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College\nEditions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year\nas we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be\nincorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to\nBates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.\n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously\nbad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML\nconsider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s\ntranslation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,\nLetters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably\nthe definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3\nNovember 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion.\nIf he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition\nof Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s *Complete Essays* in 1958, may\nnot have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Florio translation (1933–1945) G10.1\n\nMontaigne, *Essays*, Trechmann translation (1946–1948) G10.2"

The ML’s typesetting was made\nfrom a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he\nindicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March\n1949). The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates\nbecame the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against\nroyalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed\nnothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties\nwere due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition\npassed 30,000 copies. Hackett received $750 from Liveright when the ML\nedition was published and nothing thereafter.\n\nArthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930\nlived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American\npublishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of\nhis own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the\n$2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that\nthe ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random\nHouse he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in\nDecember 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies,\nleaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20.

(*Spring 1967 format*)\n\nML original collection. Published December 1949. *WR* 21 January 1950.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\nFriedrich received a $750 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy.\nAt first he planned to include selections from *Critique of Pure Reason*\nbut wrote Commins in 1948: “I have come to feel more and more strongly\nas I have worked over the materials that it is going to be very\nunsatisfactory to include short extracts from the Critique of Pure\nReason.” He suggested omitting *Critique of Pure Reason* altogether and\nincluding fuller extracts from the *Prolegomena* (Friedrich to Commins,\n14 October 1948). Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page\nselection from the Introduction to *Critique of Pure Reason* was\nincluded. The ML published an abridged edition of *Critique of Pure\nReason* in 1958 (506).\n\nFriedrich wrote Commins that he thought that *The Philosophy of Kant*\nwas a misleading title since large parts of the *Critique* were not\nincluded. He suggested calling the book *Introduction to Kant* or\n*Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy* (Friedrich to Commins,\n20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had\nalready been announced. He argued that *The Philosophy of Kant* did not\nmisrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but\nhe offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to\nFriedrich, 25 July 1949).\n\nWhen he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest\neditor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12\nOctober 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).\n\nSales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950.\n\n#### 422b.

(*Fall 1949*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for fall 1949. *WR* 11 February 1950. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\n*The Oregon Trail* was originally scheduled for publication in the\nIllustrated Modern Library in fall 1947. Winold Reiss received $2,000\nfor the artwork. He had been commissioned to provide 10–15 full-page\ndrawings, 10–15 fractional-page drawings, and small drawings for each of\nthe chapter heads. All of the drawings except one for the binding were\nto be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21\nJanuary 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before\nescalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated\nModern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both *The Oregon\nTrail* and Alcott’s *Little Women*, the other Illustrated Modern Library\ntitle announced for fall 1947.\n\nAt this point the type for *The Oregon Trail* was in galleys and the\nplates for the illustrations were partially made. The type was held for\nnearly two years until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *The\nOregon Trail* without illustrations in the regular ML. *Little Women*\n(431) was added to the regular series the following year.\n\nThe jacket illustration is one of ten full-page illustrations that Reiss\nmade for the Illustrated Modern Library. Commager received $100 for the\nintroduction and appears to have been late in delivering it. Cerf wrote\nhim about the introduction at the end of June, noting that the volume\nwas at the page proof stage and ready for plating (Cerf to Commager, 29\nJune 1949)."

The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond\nChandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo\nto Cerf, 23 September 1946).\n\nHaycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight.\nIn his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in\ndetective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the\ngrowth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely\nimitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection\nwas available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has\nexcelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that\nthe hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and\ndistinct form” (p. xii).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed.

Front flap reset with the\nfollowing revisions in the second sentence: “fifteen” omitted, “finest”\nchanged to “most distinguished”. (*Fall 1955; Fall 1962*)\n\nOriginally published by Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1932. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall 1950.\n*WR* 30 September 1950. First printing: 7,500 copies.\n\nRandom House became Faulkner’s publisher in 1936 when it acquired Smith\nand Haas. At that time the only Faulkner title in the ML was *Sanctuary*\n(233), which had been selected in 1932 because it was the only work of\nFaulkner’s for which plates were available. No further Faulkner titles\nwere added until 1946, when *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*\n(394) were published in one volume, printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. The publication of that volume, together with *The Portable\nFaulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley and published by Viking Press a few\nmonths earlier, led to widespread recognition of Faulkner’s stature as a\nmajor American author. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature\nin 1949. The Modern Library edition of *Light in August*, published four\nyears after *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*, became the third\nFaulkner volume in the series.\n\nThe ML reset *Light in August* because Smith and Haas had not made\nplates. All four Smith and Haas printings had been from standing type\nwhich had since been melted. The only previous reprint edition of *Light\nin August*, published by New Directions in its Modern Readers series in\n1947, was photographically reproduced from the Smith and Haas edition\nand printed by offset lithography.\n\nIn addition to the first printing of 7,500 copies, printings of 429.1a\nwere as follows: 5,000 copies (1951), 5,000 copies (1952), 5,000 copies\n(1953), 5,000 copies (1954), two printings of 5,000 copies each (1955),\n5,000 copies (1956), three printings of 5,000 copies each (1957), four\nprintings of 5,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 10,000 copies (1959), 10,000\ncopies (1960), 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 10,000 copies each\n(1962). These figures have been compiled from scattered records of\nbinding orders and printed sheets received; some records may be missing\n(there are no records for 1958) but the total of 127,500 copies for the\nperiod 1950–62 is probably accurate within 10,000 copies or so.\n\n#### 429.1b.

The introduction to\nFaulkner’s *Light in August* was also dropped around this time.\nIntroductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML\nbegan to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper.\nThe earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in\nAugust* in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner\ntitles in white uniform jackets. Four, including *Light in August*, were\nexisting ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four\ntitles—*Selected Short Stories*, *Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and\n*Pylon* —were new to the ML.

The overwhelming length of his masterpiece, *Clarissa—*over\n> 2,000 pages in its unabridged form—has frightened away all too many\n> readers.

Cerf asked for a book of no more than 600 pages with the\nmanuscript to be delivered by 1 February 1950. He told Burrell: “This\nprovision of size should mean that our condensation will be somewhat\nlonger—and I know it will be better—than any other condensation now in\nexistence” (Cerf to Burrell, 4 November 1949). The published volume\nexceeded the anticipated length by 200 pages.\n\nRandom House announced the forthcoming ML edition as *Clarissa Harlowe*.\nBurrell wrote to emphasize that the correct title was *Clarissa, or, The\nHistory of a Young Lady* (Burrell to Cerf and Commins, 23 February\n1950). Commins wanted to use *Clarissa Harlowe* on the jacket. He argued\nthat *Clarissa* was not enough to identify the book, that the full title\nwas too long, and that everyone knew it by the incorrect title (Commins,\nundated memo to Klopfer). In the end the full title *Clarissa or The\nHistory of a Young Lady* was used on the title page but the running\nheads record the title as THE HISTORY OF \\[verso pages\\] CLARISSA HARLOW\n\\[recto pages\\]. The front panel of jacket A reads *Clarissa* | THE\nHISTORY OF | CLARISSA HARLOWE, THE FIRST AND | ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS |\nHEROINES OF THE ENGLISH NOVEL.\n\nThe front panel of jacket B records the title as Clarissa | or The\nHistory of a Young Lady."

Jousset received $2,000 for the artwork, which included\ncolor illustrations as well as about 40 line drawings. The line drawings\nranged from chapter heads to a double-page spread, but most appeared on\npages along with text. The composition order was placed in May, shortly\nbefore escalating production costs forced the suspension of the\nIllustrated Modern Library. Paper orders were canceled in June for both\n*Little Women* and Parkman’s *Oregon Trail*, the other Illustrated\nModern Library title announced for fall 1947.\n\nAt this point the type for *Little Women* was in galleys (the text was\nset from the edition published in Grosset & Dunlap’s Illustrated Junior\nLibrary), half of the plates for the color illustrations were completed,\nand all of the line cuts had been made. The type was held for nearly two\nyears until a decision was made in April 1949 to publish *Little Women*\nin the regular ML without color illustrations. *The Oregon Trail* (423)\nwas also published in the regular series. The illustration on the jacket\nof *Little Women* is unsigned but is almost certainly one of the color\nillustrations Jousset made for the Illustrated Modern Library.\n\nThe ML edition appears to have been unsuccessful. There was a second\nprinting in spring 1954 before the ML edition was discontinued."

Out of it\n> came one of the most influential religious autobiographies of Western\n> literature, the *Apologia Pro Vita Sua*. It is far more than a\n> vigorous defense of religious adherence; it is an affirmation of faith\n> and conviction, a projection of a magnetic and powerful personality\n> and a dynamic account of spiritual conversion. Anton C. Pegis, the\n> renowned Thomist scholar and distinguished Catholic philosopher,\n> provides an illuminating and perceptive introduction for Cardinal\n> Newman’s masterpiece.

Maritain either declined or did not reply.\nCerf then turned to Pegis, who had worked with Random House and the ML\nin the past. At Commins’s request Pegis secured a nihil obstat and\nimprimatur on his introduction. Commins sent Pegis a copy of the\noriginal 1864 edition to mark for composition purposes (Commins to\nPegis, 10 April 1950). Pegis initially hoped to include Newman’s\ncorrections from the 1865 edition but decided to use the original text\naccompanied by the correspondence with Charles Kingsley (pp. 373–90) and\nKingsley’s pamphlet, *What, Then, Does Dr. Newman Mean?* (pp. 391–430)."

First ML printing: Not ascertained.\n\nPublished spring 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. Briggs received a flat\nfee of $250 to prepare a Keats collection for MLCE (Stein to Briggs, 28\nJune 1950). In June 1951 Stein indicated that a decision had been made\nto include the volume in the regular ML as well. “When the contract was\noriginally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition . . . we\ncould not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of\nknowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to\nbring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy\nof sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern\nLibrary series, hoping thereby to retrieve a part of our investment”\n(Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1951). Stein sent Briggs an additional payment\nof $100 in recognition of the publication of *The Complete Poetry and\nSelected Prose of John Keats* in the regular ML.\n\nThe volume was printed from offset plates at a time when most ML titles\nwere printed letterpress. Freiman was disappointed with the quality of\nthe printing. When the first set of MLCE sheets arrived he told the ML’s\nprinter that the quality was “very bad. I would not feel so sad about\nthis were it not for the fact that these are printed from a new set of\nplates. Further, I have been impressed with the fine quality of printing\nthe Rinehart editions enjoy” (Freiman to Richard Simon, Parkway\nPrinting, 10 May 1951). MLCE had been created to compete with Rinehart\nEditions in the burgeoning college market.\n\nThe text of the poems “is substantially that of the first editions. A\nnumber of emendations have been made as a result of collating later\neditions. . . . Some silent changes in punctuation, etc., have been made\nin the interest of greater clarity. The text of Keats’s letters . . . is\nreprinted by permission of Oxford University Press from Maurice Buxton\nForman’s *The Letters of John Keats*” (p. xxxv)."

Stein asked several\nprofessors about including *Nostromo* in MLCE and decided to go ahead\ndespite the lukewarm response. Doubleday wanted it to be included in\nboth the regular ML and MLCE because royalties for the MLCE edition were\nonly 2 cents a copy. Doubleday indicated that two sets of plates were\navailable, one of 631 pages in excellent shape and one of 537 pages in\npoor condition. Stein recommended that *Nostromo* be included in the\nregular ML and that the better plates be used (Stein memo to Haas, 15\nAugust 1950).\n\nAfter *Nostromo* entered the public domain Klopfer inquired if a lower\nroyalty would be appropriate. He was informed that Doubleday continued\nto receive full royalties on other editions and replied, “As long as\neverybody else is paying regular royalties certainly I don’t want to\nalter the terms. It’s just when a book actually gets kicked around in\nthe public domain that we feel a change in arrangements should be made”\n(Klopfer to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 14 November 1963; Barbara Drysdale,\nDoubleday, to Klopfer, 6 December 1963; Klopfer to Drysdale, 12 December\n1963).\n\n#### 438.2a.

When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted that\n*Four Famous Greek Plays* (178) would have to be completely revised. He\ntold Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the\nModern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart\nEdition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In\naddition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more\nspecifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we\nprepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based\nupon the Lifetime Library \\[Random House\\] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK\nDRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give\nthe College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted that\n*Seven Famous Greek Plays* would differ from the Rinehart anthology in\nthe following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have\nEuripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally\ndesirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’\nLysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I\nthink for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do\nnot.”\n\nStein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library\nedition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he\nindicated that the use of these translations would depend on the\npermission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit\nthe ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions\nthat prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the\ngeneral introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein\nconcluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book\navailable for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of\nJuly 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1\nFebruary 1950).\n\nOates received a flat fee of $200 for his general introduction to Greek\ntragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a\nflat fee of $100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the\nintroduction to *The Frogs*. Permission fees included $100 each for\nAldington’s translation of *Alcestis* and Murray’s translation of *The\nFrogs*; More’s translation of *Prometheus Bound* appears to have\nrequired a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional $100\nwhen *Seven Famous Greek Plays* was added to the regular ML (Commins to\nOates, 28 June 1951).\n\n#### 439b.

His poetry, at once the most intensely\n> personal in literature and of the most pervasive influence, has taken\n> its place among the sublime utterances of man. Appropriately, the\n> introduction to the Modern Library edition of the complete *Leaves of\n> Grass* was written by Walt Whitman’s most distinguished American\n> disciple, Carl Sandburg.

Kouwenhoven indicated that the ML needed a thoroughly revised\nvolume of Whitman’s writings when Stein invited him to write a new\nintroduction for the College Edition. Stein agreed and offered him a\nflat fee of $250 to select and edit the text and write the introduction,\nnoting that the new edition would assure the ML of “a book considerably\nmore desirable than that offered by any competitors, not only in terms\nof quantity of material but in terms of the more complete picture it\ngives of Whitman himself” (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 25 January 1950; 5\nApril 1950; 10 April 1950).

Published fall 1951. *WR* 29 December 1951. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\n*Six Modern American Plays* was originally intended for Modern Library\nCollege Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and added\nlater to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee $150 for selecting the\nplays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950).\nHalline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline\nbegan by suggesting Anderson’s *Winterset*, Kaufman and Hart’s *The Man\nWho Came to Dinner*, O’Neill’s *Mourning Becomes Electra*, Robert\nSherwood’s *There Shall Be No Night*, Philip Barry’s *Hotel Universe*,\nand Sidney Howard’s *Yellow Jack*. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who\nrejected *Hotel Universe* and *Yellow Jack* and indicated his preferred\nfor O’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* and Sherwood’s *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*.\n\nStein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’s\n*Little Foxes*. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new\ndramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’s *Glass Menagerie*\nor *A Streetcar Named Desire*, Arthur Miller’s *Death of a Salesman*, or\nHeggen and Logan’s *Mister Roberts;* his own preference, he indicated,\nwas Williams. Halline approved *The Emperor Jones*, *Abe Lincoln in\nIllinois* and *The Glass Menagerie* (Halline to Stein, 28 September\n1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup: *The Emperor\nJones*, *Winterset*, *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, *The Little Foxes*,\n*The Glass Menagerie*, and *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*. Sherwood’s play\nwas dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission. *Death of a\nSalesman* was the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty\nthan the ML was prepared to pay. *Mister Roberts* was finally selected,\nin part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid\nroyalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay\nhalf a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition.\n\nIn the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the\nintroduction only.\n\nStein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out\nthe anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The\ncosts of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College\nEdition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find\nsome way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline,\n25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951). *Six Modern American\nPlays* was added to MLCE in the mid-1960s.\n\nO’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* is reprinted in the version originally\npublished by Boni and Liveright in 1921. For more information see\nO’Neill, *The Emperor Jones; The Straw* (1928: 157).\n\n#### 441b.

Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in *The Rise of Silas Lapham* in 1937,\nwhen he asked if the ML could reprint it using the plates of Houghton,\nMifflin’s Centenary Edition (Cerf to Robert Linscott, Houghton, Mifflin,\n18 October 1937). Linscott replied that it could not be released to the\nML because Houghton, Mifflin had just published a new edition printed\nfrom new plates.\n\nStein initially approached Alfred Kazin about writing the introduction,\noffering him $150 (Stein to Kazin, 26 June 1950). Kazin declined but\nexpressed interest in *Charterhouse of Parma*; Stein indicated that if\nStendhal’s novel were added to MLCE the introduction would be reserved\nfor him (Stein to Kazin, 21 July 1950). He then asked Jacques Barzun,\nincreasing the fee to $200. Barzun declined on the grounds that he was\nnot equipped to do Howells justice (Stein to Barzun, 4 August 1950;\nBarzun to Stein, 9 August 1950). Stein succeeded on his third attempt.\nClark received $200 for the introduction (Stein to Clark, 14 August\n1950).\n\nThe official publication date as indicated in review copies was 25\nSeptember 1951.

He then offered Stauffer $250 to prepare the\nMLCE collection (Stein to Stauffer, 4 August 1950).\n\nCommins told Stauffer before the book was published, “When the contract\nwas originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition of\nSELECTED POETRY AND PROSE OF COLERIDGE, we could not foresee the\nastronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales\npossibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some\nsort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have\nhad to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series,\nhoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer,\n28 June 1951). Stauffer received an additional $100 when the regular ML\nedition appeared.\n\nThe poetry was set from *The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor\nColeridge*, ed. E. T. Coleridge (Clarendon Press, 1912). *Biographia\nLiteraria*, included in its entirety, was set from the edition of J.\nShawcross (Clarendon Press, 1907). Coleridge’s critical essays, “Romeo\nand Juliet” and “Hamlet, 1813,” were set from *Shakespearean Criticism*,\ned. T. M. Raysor (Harvard University Press, 1930). The remaining prose\nwas set from Coleridge’s *Complete Works*, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (7 vols.,\nHarper & Bros., 1853). MLCE printings acknowledged the Clarendon Press;\nthe acknowledgement did not appear in the regular ML edition, which\nconcerned Stein (RH box 783)."

That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been\n> reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life\n> ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St.\n> Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons\n> which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily\n> wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by\n> Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry\n> and a generous selection of his prose. (*Spring 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s *Complete Poetry\nand Selected Prose*, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed\nfrom plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. *WR* 5\nApril 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from\nNonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein\nto Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The\nML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore\nmore economical to print.\n\n*The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne* was originally\nscheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition\nwas postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of\n$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an\nadditional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.\nStein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:\n\n> There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in\n> the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a\n> number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being\n> carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John\n> Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they\n> have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high\n> for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College\n> Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue\n> getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a\n> disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production\n> aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever\n> before.

To his friend Ben Jonson he was\n> “first poet in the world for some things,” but “for not keeping of\n> accent deserved hanging.” Dr. Johnson and Dryden, each a cultural\n> arbiter of his time, shared a low opinion of Donne’s work: according\n> to Dryden, he “affects the metaphysics . . . in his amorous verses,\n> where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair\n> sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their\n> hearts, and entertain them with the softness of love.”\n>\n> But in the first three decades of this century Donne was the poet,\n> more than any other, to whom British and American poets turned for\n> inspiration in language and sensibility.

Discontinued 1970/71; retained in\nMLCE.\n\nThe ML initially asked Frederick A. Pottle of Yale University to abridge\nBoswell’s *Life of Samuel Johnson*. Pottle indicated that he was badly\nbehind schedule with Boswell’s *Journal* for McGraw-Hill and added, “I\nhave no great enthusiasm for the task of abridging Boswell’s *Life of\nJohnson*. . . . I do feel that the work has artistic integrity and that\nto abridge it is to lessen its value. And I doubt whether people will\nbuy an abridgement much more readily than the entire text. My guess is\nthat the general public can’t be sold on any English classic; that is,\nthat they buy only what they are told is novel. The principal sale of\nBoswell’s *Life of Johnson* will continue to be for textbook use in\nschools and colleges. For that use, I think the Oxford Press has the\nbest offering: a complete reprint of Boswell’s text <u>with a good\nindex</u>” (Stein to Pottle, 27 April 1951; Pottle to Stein, 7 May 1951;\nunderlining in original). Pottle was referring to the MLG edition of\n*The Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2) which lacked an index.\n\nStein proposed three other possible editors to Cerf. The first was\nBergen Evans, who had written the introduction to Sterne’s *Tristam\nShandy* in MLCE (1950) and was the author of *The Natural History of\nNonsense* (1946). Stein also suggested Joseph Wood Krutch and Louis\nKronenberger, but he indicated that Evans was his first choice (Stein\nmemo to Cerf, 9 May 1951). Stein wrote Evans, who expressed interest in\nthe project. Evans had done his B.Litt at Oxford and Ph.D. at Harvard on\nJohnson. Referring to Krutch’s biography, *Samuel Johnson* (Henry Holt,\n1944), he noted, “Krutch beat me to the book I would like to have\nwritten and did it better than I could have done it” (Evans to Stein, 29\nJune 1951).\n\nStein indicated that he wanted an abridgment of 210,000–230,000 words.\n“There is apparently a growing interest in Boswell and Johnson, and\nthere is not at the moment a popularly available low-priced abridgment\nof Boswell.” He offered Evans a flat fee of $1,000 for the work (Stein\nto Evans, 10 July 1951).\n\nEvans began working with the MLG edition of Boswell’s *Life of Samuel\nJohnson* (G2) but reported, “I made about thirty test borings into the\nfirst 150 pages of the Modern Library Giant and came up with a dismal\nnumber of errors. The sixth Malone edition, I have since discovered, is\nnotoriously corrupt and I saw no great value in deciding whether the\nerrors I found in the MLG were original with it or carried over from\nMalone” (Evans to Stein, 1 August 1951). The abridgment was made from\nthe definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized\nits use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to\nabout half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951). The\npermission fee, paid by the ML, was $100.\n\nEvans told Stein in a long letter:\n\n> I’m <u>enthusiastic</u> about this project. I have cut the book down\n> to about 220,000 words without omitting anything of serious\n> significance and without having to make any changes whatever except,\n> perhaps, a dozen capitalizations and substitutions of periods for\n> commas or semicolons. I would be willing to bet a hundred dollars that\n> no ordinary reader, not a Johnson scholar, could sit down and read\n> this abridgement and then read the original and be able offhand to\n> tell you what had been omitted.\n>\n> What has been omitted are: Bozzy’s fatuous reflections (not all, but\n> most; I’ve left a few as an antidote to the prevailing\n> Boswellophilia); many of Johnson’s letters—not all, by any means, and\n> no important one—mostly those to now-unknown persons . . . ; many of\n> Johnson’s prayers and meditations . . . ; critical dicta and personal\n> comments on minor eighteenth-century figures who are now utterly\n> unknown to the common reader.\n\nEvans explained how the cuts were made. He began by making his own cuts,\nthen hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing\nof her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no\nparticular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go\nthrough the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to\ncut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I\nlet the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson\ncanon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had\ncut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its\ninterest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from\nover 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text\nagain, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000,\nI believe, nothing <u>whatever</u> of any value or significance . . .\nwas taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it\nwith a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were\nirrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either\nthe sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and\nsections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves\nuninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some\nunimportant person.”\n\nHe concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything\nlike it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . <u>No</u> solid\nthought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly\nreadable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it\nmight have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951;\nunderlining in original).”\n\nEvans’s abridgment was sent for typesetting in January 1952.\nProofreading was done at Random House.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nBoswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (Giant, 1931) G2\n\nJohnson, *Johnson’s Dictionary: A Modern Selection* (1965) 572\n\nJohnson, *Johnson Reader* (1966) 580\n\n***Fall***"

He solicited\nadvice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos\nBaker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the\nHampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in\nWellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George\nStewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard\nCooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated that *The\nPathfinder* would be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper\n(Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favored *The Pathfinder*.\nThe response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone\na decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must\nadmit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present\nseems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but\nI can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters\nI have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948).\n\nThree years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and\nasked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf\nwhat he thought of a Giant containing *The Deerslayer*, *The Pilot*, and\n*Satanstoe*, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite\nCooper novel.

First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on\n16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the\nentire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.\n\nLange suggested a revision of the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s\n*Faust* which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930:\n200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only\ncollection of German narrative prose in English translation that the\nstudent is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely\nunsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to\nStein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein\nto Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of\ncontents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two\nexceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for\neconomic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length\nof the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s *Immensee* instead of\nreplacing it with the author’s *Carsten Curator* “because it has become\na ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange\nthat “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical\nsketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the\nstories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen\nselections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s\noriginal anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a\ndifferent translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of\n$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid\nthe cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for\nselections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death\nin Venice” (see 256).\n\n#### 452b.

Reissued 1977–1990.\n\nThe negotiations that resulted in publication of *Selected Stories of\nFranz Kafka* took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’\nhopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty\nover the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to\nplan a collection of thirteen stories selected from *The Penal* *Colony*\nand *The Great Wall of China* in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken\nBooks appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the\ncontract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested\nresuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November\n1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would\nuse other translations of the two most important stories and find other\nmaterial to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).\n\nCommins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and\nreported:\n\n> The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we\n> at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by\n> reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the\n> ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of\n> this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.\n>\n> I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s\n> stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of\n> the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,\n> whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is\n> valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other\n> than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.\n>\n> Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede\n> with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission\n> for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s\n> short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project\n> unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we\n> make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.\n>\n> I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into\n> the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to\n> Cerf, 8 December 1949)\n\nAfter analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins\nreported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken\n\\[*sic*\\] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.\nThere are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents\nwhich are not protected. These would require new translation, but there\nwould not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are\nconvinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen\nnegotiations with Shocken \\[*sic*\\]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January\n1950).\n\nKurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported\nthat Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation\nwhich were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken\nproposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make\na selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help\narrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).\nLittle had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months\nlater. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of\n*The Great Wall of China* with additional stories, were still\nforthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML\nselection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken\nto Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May\n1951).\n\nCerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the\nKafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could\nproduce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,\n16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952\nRandom House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the\npublication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great\nWall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It\nis not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &\nYoung guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random\nHouse’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point\nSchocken capitulated.\n\nThe ML edition of *Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa*, reprinted by\narrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared\nthree months later.\n\nThe ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received\n$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been\nascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of\n5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two\nprintings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two\nprintings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These\nfigures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;\nsome records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the\ntotal of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate\nwithin 20,000 copies or so.\n\n#### 453b.

Her\nreasons for choosing *Coming of Age in Samoa* are discussed in the\npreface to the ML edition. She writes:\n\n> My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind,\n> and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I\n> have not previously entered. My father once told me that I would never\n> write as good a book again, because, he said, “You know too much now.”\n> I dissent as strenuously as possible from this dismal prophecy, but it\n> contained an element of truth. The descriptions of Samoan life are\n> less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim,\n> by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come\n> to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the\n> way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems\n> to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the\n> years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very\n> fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the\n> limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the\n> potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social\n> invention—are far less likely to seem dated.

The only\nimportant play omitted, he told Cerf, was *Man and Superman* which had a\nvery long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final\nselection, including the addition of *Caesar and Cleopatra*, was\nprobably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction\n(Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953).\n\nIt was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure\npermission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight\ncontrol over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of\nhis plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a\nmillion copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies\neach—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to\npublish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s, *Four Plays* and *Saint\nJoan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956: 484). The only other\nvolume by Shaw in the ML was his early novel *An Unsocial Socialist*\n(15), published in the series in fall 1917.

(*Fall 1953*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published fall 1953. *WR* 24 October 1953. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nFriedrich received an advance of $750 against royalties of 5 cents a\ncopy. He had suggested the volume shortly after the publication of his\nedition of *The Philosophy of Kant* (422) (Friedrich to Commins, 14\nDecember 1950). Linscott endorsed Friedrich as “the best man for the\njob” and reminded Cerf that they had once talked about adding Hegel to\nthe ML. Cerf responded, “I like this idea, but then, of course, as a\ndevout disciple of Hegel, I am prejudiced. What does our Lowbrow Dept.\nthink of the notion?” (Cerf memo to Linscott, undated but probably late\n1950). After asking several professors of philosophy about Hegel, nearly\nall of whom thought a ML collection was needed but had reservations\nabout its sales possibilities, Commins told Friedrich to go ahead\n(Commins to Friedrich, 10 January 1951).\n\nFriedrich initially expected the volume to consist primarily of\nselections from *The Philosophy of History* and about fifty pages of\n*Lectures on Aesthetics* and *Philosophy of Right and Law*. The\ntranslation of the main part of *The Philosophy of History* is based on\nthe John Sibree translation originally published in the Bohn Library in\n1852 (Friedrich to Commins, 23 March 1951). Friedrich noted in 1952 that\nhe was having to do more work on the translations than he originally\nhoped (Friedrich to Commins, 29 May 1952).\n\nIn the first printing the selections from the Introduction to *The*\n*Philosophy of History* (460a, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are from “a translation\nmade by R. S. Hartman and revised by Schrecker, as well as the editor,\nand published by the Liberal Arts Library (Oscar Piest, editor)”\n(“Note,” p. \\[2\\]). Beginning with the second printing the selections\nfrom the Introduction (460b, pp. \\[1\\]–43) are “translated by Carl J.\nFriedrich from Georg Lasson’s second edition (1920), for which the kind\npermission of Felix Meiner Verlag was granted” (“Note on the Text,” p.\n\\[2\\]). The reason for dropping the translation used in the first\nprinting and resetting pp. \\[1\\]–42 has not been ascertained.\n\nFriedrich remarked in 1960 that both the Kant and Hegel volumes sold\nreasonably well. “I have been amused to watch the race between them and\ngratified to note that Kant outdoes Hegel every time” (Friedrich to\nKlopfer, 18 January 1960).\n\n**460b.

So\nlittle of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get\nit all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the\nshorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early\nprose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they\nbelonged only in a complete edition.

Harris proposed seven plays and\nrecommended omitting *The Beaux’ Stratagem* if only six could be\npublished. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to\nadd *The Rehearsal* (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the\nnumber of pages required and agreed to its inclusion.\n\n*Restoration Plays* and *Eighteenth-Century Plays* (1952: 448) were\nconceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected\nthe plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using\nthe first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe\nthat a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to\nHarris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to\nset *Restoration Plays* from first editions of all of the plays except\n*The Rehearsal*, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition\n(Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured\nphotostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A\ntextual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for\n*Eighteenth-Century Plays* appears on p. \\[iv\\] of *Restoration Plays*:\n\n> The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first\n> editions.

The\nvolume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was\ntwice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the\nregular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary\nto Harris, 5 May 1953)."

Published spring\n1954. *WR* 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1960.\n\nRandom House published an edition of *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of\nIspahan* with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy\nBaldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938\ndividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it\nwas printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s\nformat.\n\nStein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of $200, but Haight was\ntoo busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November\n1953). He then approached Altick, offering him $150. He wrote, “What we\nhave in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving\nlargely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth\nreading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail,\nbut there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a\nbook published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide\npleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first\nappeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his\nautobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition\nof James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, *The Adventures of Hajji\nBaba of Ispahan* . . . which, although it never came near to being one\nof the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints,\nearned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one\nof our daughters” (Altick, *A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an\nAdventurous Scholar,* p. 200).\n\nAlthough Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three\nprintings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and\nspring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume.\n\nSeveral months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I\nhave just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an\nadvance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I\nall change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to\nAltick, 23 September 1954).\n\n***Fall***"

Signed: PG \\[Paul\nGaldone\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify\n> Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our\n> times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with\n> startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer\n> appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The\n> twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly\n> understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue\n> of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but\n> they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic\n> material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human\n> experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and\n> psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that\n> experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved. (*Fall\n> 1954*)\n\n*A Curtain of Green* originally published with Porter introduction by\nDoubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as\n*A Curtain of Green and Other Stories* by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947.\n*The Wide Net and Other Stories* originally published by Harcourt, Brace\n& Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from\nHarcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First\nprinting: 5,000 copies.\n\nCerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt,\nBrace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager\nsent *A Curtain of Green*, *The Robber Bridegroom*, *The Wide Net*,\n*Delta Wedding*, and *The Golden Apples*, expressing the hope that the\nML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The\nreprint contract for *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* was signed a\nmonth later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy.\nThere was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk\nreports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (*Eudora Welty:\nA Bibliography of Her Work*, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete\ninformation about printings and sales is not available in the RH\narchives, but the following evidence is suggestive: *Selected Stories of\nEudora Welty* does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than\n2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and\nit sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500\ntitles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the\ntitles that survived.\n\nTextual variants between the first edition of *A Curtain of Green*\n(Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text\nof the Modern Library *A Curtain of Green*” (1979). Polk writes:\n\n> In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of *A\n> Curtain of Green*. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions\n> or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a\n> copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss\n> Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she\n> responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY:\n> Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John\n> Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of *A\n> Curtain of Green* is two typesettings removed from the first American\n> edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in\n> any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences\n> between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be\n> considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted\n> the Harcourt, Brace text in its *Selected Stories* (NY, 1954), it of\n> course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some\n> importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of *A\n> Curtain of Green* is both the only one currently in print and the text\n> most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6)\n\nIn his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the\nHarcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in\nprint and the one most frequently cited.\n\n#### 471b.

(Spring 1955)\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, edited by\nJ. S. Van Teslaar (108). Published spring 1955. *WR* 25 June 1955. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe revision of *An Outline of Psychoanalysis*, originally published in\n1924, was undertaken in conjunction with the revision of *An Outline of\nAbnormal Psychology* (172). Clara Thompson, Executive Director of the\nWilliam Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and\nPsychology, was recommended by Gardner Murphy shortly after he agreed to\nrevise *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* (Murphy to Stein, 23 May\n1953).\n\nThompson and her fellow editors tried to present “the many approaches\nwhich go to make up a science such as psychoanalysis” (p. \\[ix\\]) but\nran into major obstacles in securing permissions. W. W. Norton, the\npublisher of Freud, Erikson, Sullivan and Horney, refused at first to\nallow these authors to be included at all. H. P. Wilson of Norton\nexpressed concern that the anthology would adversely affect sales of the\noriginal editions and told Stein, “We do feel that we should prefer not\nto have the material from our authors included in your book” (Wilson to\nStein, 9 December 1953). Stein told Thompson that he thought Norton was\ndisturbed by RH’s plans to enter the field of psychoanalytic publishing\n(Stein to Thompson, 14 January 1954). After the extent of material by\nthese authors was reduced, Norton relented and gave permission to\ninclude them at the rate of 1¼ cents per word.\n\nAnna Freud and Maxwell Gitelson refused to allow their writings to\nappear between the covers of an anthology that also included selections\nby their rivals. Thompson wanted to include Gitelson’s article, “The\nEmotional Position of the Analyst in the Psychoanalytical Tradition.”\nGitelson noted that of the contemporary figures in Thompson’s tentative\ntable of contents, only “A. Freud, Erikson, Kris, Sharpe, and—by &\nlarge, Klein and Balint—carry on in the main direction of\npsychoanalysis.” He continued:\n\n> All of the others, Silverberg, May, Fromm-Reichmann, Schachtel,\n> Sullivan, Fromm, Horney, Thompson, Alexander and Rioch, diverge\n> significantly from what I think of as the main stream and have more in\n> common with each other than they have with psychoanalysis from the\n> standpoint from which I view it. . . .\n>\n> Unfortunately, the discussion of counter-transference problems in\n> their present transitional phase of our understanding of them can\n> sometimes come close to appearing to give priority to the\n> “interpersonal” and “social” points of view as maintained by Sullivan,\n> Fromm, Horney, Thompson, etc. Placed in the context in which it would\n> appear, my article would inevitably seem to be divergent in the sense\n> in which I think of these writers. I simply do not wish such a\n> misunderstanding to arise (Gitelson to Stein, 9 June 1954).\n\nAnna Freud would not permit the inclusion of a chapter from her book,\n*The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense*. “My reason for this,” she\nwrote, “is that I am at present not in direct collaboration with the\nother contributors to the volume, whereas the inclusion of my chapter\nwould create the wrong impression that I am” (Freud to Stein, 1 July\n1954). Stein replied:\n\n> In planning the *Outline of Psychoanalysis*, we have tried to\n> represent on the one hand the solid core of psychoanalytic writing\n> that is accepted without significant controversy. Your chapter would\n> fall into this category, and I can only ask that you believe me when I\n> say that Miss Thompson and her collaborators regard your work with the\n> highest esteem and feel that its presence in the book is essential to\n> a proper view of psychoanalysis. The other category in the collection\n> is controversial material. We have tried to present some impression of\n> the differing viewpoints that now exist. . . . Consequently, many\n> people who differ on a scientific basis with each other will appear in\n> this volume without there being any suggestion that one is right and\n> the other wrong.\n\nHe offered to include a statement in the book “explaining that many\ndifferent viewpoints are represented here and that the presence of any\nparticular writer’s material . . . does not imply an endorsement of the\nviews expressed by other writers in the book” (Stein to Freud, 8 July\n1954). But Freud was not persuaded. She replied, “I appreciate your\narguments, but there are personal reasons for this decision on my part”\n(Freud to Stein, 3 August 1954).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*Outline of Psychoanalysis,* ed.

An\nearlier reprint changed the title to *The Modern Treasury of Humorous\nVerse* (Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition\nunder its subtitle, *An Anthology of American and British Humorous and\nWitty Verse* with *What Cheer* as a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16\nJuly 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave\nfive years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he\nwrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . . *What Cheer* is short and\nsweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I\nwanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I\nthink, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship\n(the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on\nto the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954).\n\nMcCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he\nsuggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of\npeople, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could\nnot be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if\nhe really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as\nwell without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included\nthe new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.”\nPermission fees for the new verses came to $220.50; the costs for\ntypesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new\nto the ML edition were $264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955).\n\nFifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t\nsetting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it\nhas justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am\nproud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three\nyears later he had to tell McCord that *What Cheer* had “dropped so far\nbelow our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the\nseries. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as\nyou know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this\nkind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959)."

Yet it\nis precisely his spirit of scientific experimentation which has become\nthe foundation of modern science and, therefore, of the modern world\nitself. It is then very worth our while to read this volume of Bacon’s\ngreatest writings—the *Advancement of Learning*, the *Novum Organum*,\nthe *New Atlantis* and the famous *Essays*, which show his keen insight\ninto the practical problems of human conduct as well as his mastery of\nEnglish prose.

While we do not expect such a\nwork to sell very widely, we do feel that there is enough need to\nwarrant undertaking it” (Stein to Dick, 20 February 1953).

The text of\nthis edition has been prepared in the hope of making some improvement\nover previous English versions. All of the selections are complete.\nThere are no excerpts of letters or parts of chapters. . . . It is hoped\nthat the translations in this collection will help to make a beginning\ntoward an accurate edition of Voltaire in English. In every section of\nthe volume I have provided new translations wherever they were\nnecessary. I should add that the translations from Voltaire’s\n*Notebooks* are the first from that work to appear in an English\nedition. . . . Where older translations have been used, they have been\nthoroughly revised. In particular, for all of the fiction except\n*Candide*, I have modernized the version of Robert Bruce Boswell. The\ntranslation of *Candide* is by Richard Aldington. I am especially\ngrateful to Martyn P. Pollack for the selections from his excellent\nversion of *The Age of Louis XIV*, and to Floyd Gray for his assistance\nin the translating of Voltaire’s correspondence.” (Editorial Note, pp.\nxxi–xxii)\n\nThe chapters of *Candide*, like those in the 1930 ML edition (46.2), are\nset as single paragraphs, following the 1928 Random House limited\nedition of *Candide*.\n\nSales totaled 14,352 copies by spring 1958.\n\n#### 481b.

He received an additional $100 for writing the\nintroduction. A year before Chekhov’s *Best Plays* was published Stein\nhad reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern\nLibrary were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer\nregarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the\nexcellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,\n*The Cherry Orchard*, *The Three Sisters*, *Uncle Vanya*, and *The Sea\nGull*. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to\nLois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights;\nthere seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this\nstage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange\nfor the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of\ncourse go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo\nto Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”\n\nWith the Young translation of Chekhov, *Best Plays* the ML reverted to\nthe spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring\n1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript\nof her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably\nresponsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le\nGallienne file).\n\n#### 487b.

Although it is primarily a political and economic\naccount, it seems to me to be one of the clearest pictures of Greece in\nits finest day” (Stein memo to Cerf, 10 June 1955). Stein also talked to\nKlopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford\nUniversity Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered\nthat we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’s *The Greek\nCommonwealth* and we should like very much to include it in the Modern\nLibrary” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955).\n\nAn internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with\nOxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transfer *The\nGreek Commonwealth* to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A\ndecision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in\nas small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don\nSinger, 19 November 1968)."

Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956.\nFirst printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990.\n\nO’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he\nliked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: *The\nDoctor’s Son and Other Stories* (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), *Files on\nParade* (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), *Pipe Night* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce,\n1945) and *Hellbox* (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything\nfrom *Pal Joey* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out\nwith Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on\nO’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the\n32 stories in the ML collection were from *Pipe Night* and *Hellbox*.\nO’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which\nconcluded:\n\n> Most of them \\[the stories\\] were written in the twenty years from\n> 1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for\n> *The New Yorker* than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my\n> characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously\n> hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to\n> call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing\n> to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick\n> of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in\n> Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well,\n> damn their eyes.\n>\n> I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years\n> I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the\n> preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But\n> during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was\n> part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and\n> one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection,\n> Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, *O’Hara Concern*, p.\n> 233).\n\nThe foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended\ndeleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it\n(Weil, Gotshal & Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955).\nCerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to\npersuade him to tone down his language:\n\n> Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your\n> Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself\n> as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but\n> important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time,\n> I promise never to mention the matter again.\n>\n> I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out\n> of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence,\n> “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even\n> last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE\n> TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not\n> think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected\n> Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment.\n> This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a\n> collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short\n> stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant\n> reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly\n> concerned even remembers?\n>\n> I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in\n> or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just\n> hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and,\n> furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New\n> Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. \\[Harold\\] Ross, who was Editor of\n> the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead;\n> \\[Brendan\\] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand\n> times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the\n> good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are\n> slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.\n>\n> I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands,\n> several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of\n> your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.\n>\n> There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and\n> that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).\n\nThere is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably\ntelephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf\nimmediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an\nintroduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).\n\nThere were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, *John\nO’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography*, p. 216).\n\n#### 489b.

(*Spring 1957*)\n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific*\n(Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of\nAsia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri*\n(RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing:\n7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.\n\nIn the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition\nof his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the\npublisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a\nchance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the\npoorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start\nnew chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:\n\n> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and\n> another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about\n> Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long\n> humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word\n> *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word\n> to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps\n> even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books\n> appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what\n> I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I\n> have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain\n> stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have\n> retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I\n> would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).\n\nMichener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of\n*Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April\n1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August\n2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random\nHouse in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long\nand highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of\nSaxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose\nthe firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to\nuse a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has\nmade from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to\nDorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton\nUniversity Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a\n1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at\nMadison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old\nMansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174).\n\nInconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are\nreproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a\njacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of\nToko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”\n\n#### 494b.

Harper’s finally offered\nthe ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading\nfor Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf\ntold it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a\nlong, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found\nirresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD\nand Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library.

The ML paid royalties of 10\npercent of the retail price. *Brave New World* (485) was published in\nthe ML in fall 1956.\n\nBowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D\nof the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month\nClub using duplicate plates supplied by Harper & Bros.

In 1952 he wrote Haskell Block of the University of\nWisconsin, “In a very tentative way I have thought of the possibility of\nour doing a little collection of epic and romance in the Modern Library\nsome day. I don’t know whether such a thing would ever go, but I have\nbeen asking people for suggestions as to contents . . .” (Stein to\nBlock, 31 October 1952).\n\nRoger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis initially received\nroyalties of 5 cents a copy. In 1961, when ML books were selling for\n$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based\non a retail price of $1.45. (*Medieval Romances* was published at $1.65,\nbut the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still\n$1.45.) Random House usually rejected requests for higher royalties on\nthese grounds, but the Loomis’s royalties were increased to 10 cents a\ncopy.\n\n#### 497b.

Linscott received a flat fee of $1,350 for\nabridging the text and editing the ML edition. He told Cerf that the\nproject was about twice the work he anticipated because of the poor\nediting of the complete edition.\n\n*The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci* was the first abridgment that\nLinscott made for the ML after his retirement from Random House.

First printing: Not ascertained but probably\naround 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64.\n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown a $3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958\nthat he wanted to publish *The Catcher in the Rye* and Salinger’s *Nine\nStories* (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already\navailable in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at\nall. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups\nthat patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8\nJanuary 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a\nperiod of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no\nphotograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to\napprove the jacket copy.\n\nPrintings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000\nand 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and\n10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962).\nIn the following table ML sales of *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* chart Salinger’s popularity with precision.\n\nTable: ML sales of Salinger’s *Cather in the Rye* and *Nine Stories*,\n1958–63\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>CATCHER IN THE RYE</td>\n<td>NINE STORIES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Year ending</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/59</td>\n<td>7,171</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/60</td>\n<td>9,915</td>\n<td>7,966</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/61</td>\n<td>9,935</td>\n<td>4,680</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>4/62</td>\n<td>23,963</td>\n<td>14,142</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>4/63</td>\n<td>14,014</td>\n<td>10,478</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>TOTAL</td>\n<td>64,998</td>\n<td>37,266</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSalinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for *Catcher in\nthe Rye* and *Nine Stories* not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’\ntermination notice for *Catcher in the Rye* and indicated that the ML\nwould have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to\nKlopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to\nSalinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important\nbooks in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified\na manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000\ncopies of *Catcher in the Rye* and over 37,000 copies of *Nine Stories*\nand asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another\nthree years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963).\n\nThere is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in\nJuly that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no\nmore printings of *Catcher in the Rye* (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July\n1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is\nincluded in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer\n1964 stock list.\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of *Catcher in\nthe Rye*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when *Four\nContemporary French Plays* (598) was published as ML 90.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSalinger*, Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516"

First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nAldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to\nHiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be\nmaking new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that\nit would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to\nAldridge, 19 July 1957).\n\nWodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he\nwould be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in *Carry\nOn, Jeeves!* were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML\nused most of the first Jeeves book and all of *Very Good, Jeeves*. He\nalso suggested updating several references in the stories and changing\nthe title to *A Gathering of Jeeves* (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August\n1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked\nWodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that\nhe weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that\nfor Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also\nasked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories.\n“Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period\nand . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary\nconfusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent\nadmirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title *Selected\nStories*. “The latter \\[*A Gathering of Jeeves*\\] may sound a little bit\nbetter, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell\nbest when they state very clearly what the book contains, without\nreaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August\n1957).\n\nWodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s\nintroduction was written for the ML but also appeared in *New World\nWriting*, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92."

Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nCerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as\n1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a\nduplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William\nTarg, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May\n1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the *American College\nDictionary* in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By\ndeleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the\ncontent to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the\ndictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the\n*American College Dictionary* by 50 percent would require making much\nsharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a\nGiant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with *The\nConcise Oxford Dictionary*, the Funk and Wagnalls *Desk Standard\nDictionary*, and the *Winston Advanced Dictionary* (School Edition). He\nestimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and\nthat editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott,\n18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans\nto publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. *The* *Modern\nLibrary Dictionary* (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000\nentries.\n\n*The Modern Library Dictionary* was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall\n1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A,\n1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because\nnew business machines acquired by Random House could not handle\nnumber-letter combinations. Copies of *The Modern Library Dictionary*\nthat remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number\n“1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.\n\nThe *First* statement on the verso of the title page appears to have\nbeen removed on all subsequent printings."

Auden* which Random House published in\n1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer\nturned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in\nVintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback\nedition because *Collected Poetry* was selling so well (Klopfer to\nAlfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).\n\nThe ML reprinted *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* because Auden\ndid not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered\nbuying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S.\ncopyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been\nset in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention,\nwhich the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement\nfor works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S.\ncitizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer\nwrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might\ninvalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance”\n(Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set\nof proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of\nuncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the\nPenguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7\nJuly 1958).\n\nAuden included the following note on p. \\[*8*\\] following the table of\ncontents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the\nchronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the\nlast from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony\nor sense or both”.\n\nThe ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson\nreport a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings\nof 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two\nprintings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and\n7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969).\n\n#### 510b.

They are so scattered it is difficult\nto obtain the more important parts.” Fadiman commented, “Not as crazy as\nit sounds—the Jung cult is fairly large, the name better and better\nknown, and the Bollingen translations are good and easily buyable from\nKurt \\[Wolff, the founder of Pantheon Books\\]” (Fadiman to Klopfer, 13\nApril 1956).

The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need\n> was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of\n> Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should\n> undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”\n>\n> Four years later *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and\n> Architects* was published in Florence. The time and the man had come\n> together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a\n> great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian\n> Renaissance.\n>\n> Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of\n> the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as\n> the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything\n> considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (*Fall\n> 1959*)\n\nML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London\nby the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959. *WR*\n19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nLinscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He\noriginally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs.\nJonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the\nDeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser\ntranslation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000\nwords.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the\nmanuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s\nworth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates”\n(Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume\nDeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the\nU.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of\npictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable\nmoralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential\nVasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to\nchange the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has\nbeen done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a\nbuilding it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American\nreaders” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).\n\nLinscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he\nthought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to\nCerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and\nan expensive illustrated edition by S & S \\[Simon and Schuster\\] with\ndisgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print.\nInstead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff,\ninaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly\naccurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957)."

ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–302) printed from Little, Brown plates with decorative rules\nremoved from table of contents, fly title and chapter heads in all\nprintings of 516a. Published September 1959. *WR* 28 September 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65.\n\nCerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped *Nine Stories* could be\nincluded in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He\nsubsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint *The* *Catcher in\nthe Rye* (504) and *Nine Stories* in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger\nasked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the\nentry for *The Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the\npresident of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal\nnotice that termination of the *Nine Stories* contract would become\neffective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to\ndispose of any copies on hand.\n\nThe Little, Brown half title (*Nine Stories*) is sandwiched between two\ndecorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “*by*\nJ. D. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The\nML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | *OF THE WORLD’S\nBEST BOOKS* followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line\nstatement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated\nfolder listing each volume in the series.\n\nPrintings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960),\n15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing\nin spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of *Nine Stories* are\nincluded in the entry for *The* *Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504).\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of *Nine\nStories*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when\n*Renaissance Philosophy*, vol. 2*: The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611)\nwas published as ML 301*.*\n\n#### 516b.
