These do not\n> present a complete system of philosophy, but rather special and\n> intensive studies of problems Mr. James felt to be momentous and\n> living at the time. The systematic statement of his position which he\n> aimed at in “Some Problems of Philosophy” was denied him; he died\n> before the book was half done.\n>\n> The selections which make up this book have been chosen with the view\n> of presenting the philosophy of William James systematically in his\n> own words and in the convenient compass, with some approximation to\n> that rounded wholeness he himself would have given it had he lived to\n> complete his work. (*Fall 1925*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)\n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform philosophy jacket in moderate green (145) and black\non cream paper. Signed: WC.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The world recognizes that William James stands pre-eminent among the\n> philosophers of America. His writings have had an influence that has\n> reached beyond the borders of philosophy and into the realms of the\n> social sciences, psychology and religion. In this volume the essence\n> of his contributions to the thought of our day is concentrated. Always\n> the lucid writer and the profound thinker, his good sense and\n> forthright style clear away pretences and obscurities of thought. His\n> is a philosophy that reconciles man to the stream of existence. (*Fall\n> 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published December 1925. *WR* 19 December 1925.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nKallen received royalties of 10 cents a copy for his editorial work on\n*The Philosophy of William James*. His royalties during the first six\nmonths of 1926 totaled $179.40. The ML probably paid flat permissions\nfees to James’s original publishers. A few days after *The Philosophy of\nWilliam James* was published Cerf invited Kallen to edit a similar\nvolume devoted to Bertrand Russell, but Kallen appears to have declined.\nThe ML published *Selected Papers of Bertrand Russell* (147) in October\n1927. The volume credits Russell as editor but most of the editorial\nwork appears to have been done by Manuel Komroff. In November 1926\nKallen proposed a companion volume devoted to George Santayana. Cerf was\ninterested and initially told Kallen to go ahead, but he canceled the\nproject three months later, fearing that Charles Scribner’s Sons, which\npublished most of Santayana’s works, would not grant the necessary\npermissions. Ten years later Scribner’s published its own collection,\n*The Philosophy of Santayana*, which was reprinted in the ML in 1942\n(see 355).\n\nSales of *The Philosophy of William James* during the first six months\nof 1928 placed it 58th out of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period\nMay 1942‑October 1943 it was low in the second quarter of ML sales.\n\n"

He is a dreamy, rather\n> stupid “poor white” boy who “piddles around” with little mechanical\n> tricks while he is a bored telegraph operator—until an invention made\n> \\[*sic*\\] him suddenly rich and famous. Then comes the “poor white’s”\n> love, and again the forces that twist men make Hugh McVey’s story a\n> wild and terrible one, bigger than the mere story of one man. If, as\n> the critics have said, Anderson’s WINESBURG, OHIO, marks the point of\n> our literary adolescence, POOR WHITE testifies to our artistic\n> majority. It transcends the limitations of his earlier books and\n> develops their latent qualities the promise of his previous work is\n> fulfilled. (*Fall 1925)*\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap: <br>\n> As the interpreter of Middle Western life, Sherwood Anderson holds a\n> supreme position among American novelists. *Poor White*, like\n> *Winesburg, Ohio* (No. 104 in the Modern Library), became immediately\n> upon its appearance the forerunner of a vital school of contemporary\n> writing. This story of new forces, creating cities overnight, making\n> men rich and powerful or poor and rejected, takes its origin directly\n> from our own soil and from the American way of life with all the\n> naturalness and humanity for which Anderson has become world\n> celebrated. (*Spring 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1920; Huebsch merged with Viking\nPress, August 1925. ML edition (pp. \\[1\\]–371) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with the dedication omitted in early printings.\nPublished February 1926. *WR* 13 February 1926. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued fall 1939.\n\nWhen Anderson became a B&L author in April 1925, Liveright expressed\ninterest in taking over his earlier books from Huebsch and including\n*Poor White* in the ML in the fall (Liveright to Anderson, 11 April\n1925; Anderson Papers, Newberry Library). A clause in Anderson’s\ncontract with B&L stated: “The publisher further agrees to immediately\nendeavor to purchase from B. W. Huebsch, if the author so advises in\nwriting, the reprint rights for Poor White for The Modern Library”\n(contract dated 10 April 1925; Anderson Papers). Liveright sold the ML\nbefore *Poor White* could be added to the series. It is not known\nwhether reprint rights for the ML edition were negotiated before or\nafter the sale.\n\nFor writing the introduction Anderson received a complete set of ML\nbooks instead of the usual $50 fee (Cerf to Anderson, 14 November 1925).\nHe wrote in the introduction: “There is this book, ‘Poor White’—now to\nbe published in The Modern Library, tricked out in a new dress, going to\ncall on new people. The Modern Library is something magnificent. Long\nrows of names—illustrious names. My book, ‘Poor White,’ feels a little\nlike a countryman going to live in a great modern sophisticated city”\n(ML ed., p. vi).\n\nThe dedication to Tennessee Mitchell Anderson, from whom Anderson was\ndivorced in 1924, was omitted from the ML edition at his request\n(Anderson to Cerf, undated but before 14 November 1925). The dedication\nwas inadvertently restored in later printings (see variant B).\n\nSales of *Poor White* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 85th\nout of 147 ML titles. Printings of the ML edition totaled 15,000 copies\nby April 1930, including printings of 4,000 copies (August 1927), 1,000\ncopies (August 1929), and 2,000 copies (April 1930).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nAnderson, *Winesburg, Ohio* (1921–1973) 96"

Publication announced for May 1926.\n*WR* 16 October 1926. First (and only) printing: 2,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1928.\n\nLewis C. Page promoted reprints of his firm’s publications so\naggressively that Liveright once told him: “Without any offense to you,\nit appears to us that you are trying to bludgeon us to take titles that\nare absolutely unsuitable for us and undesirable so that we may have the\nprivilege of continuing others on our list that are. For the time being,\nat least, we do not even care to add another D’Annunzio to our list,\nalthough some time next year we might very gladly consider The Intruder\nor The Maidens of the Rocks” (Liveright to Page, 10 July 1924; RH box\n128, L. C. Page & Co. file 7). Page took this statement as a firm\ncommitment on Liveright’s part to include both *The Maidens of the\nRocks* and *The Intruder* in the ML. When Cerf and Klopfer took over the\nseries he demanded that they pay advances of $240 against royalties of 8\ncents a copy for each title. Cerf and Klopfer acquiesced and paid him\n$480 with the intention of publishing one title in 1926 and the other\nthe following year (Page to ML, 2 September 1925; ML to Page, 10\nSeptember 1925).\n\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* sold poorly and Cerf informed Page at the\nbeginning of 1927 that no Page title would be added to the ML that year.\nPage responded with a pitch for *The Intruder*, noting that it was part\nof the trilogy that included *The Child of Pleasure* and *The Flame of\nLife* and corresponded with them “in motif and sex appeal.” He described\n*The Maidens of the Rocks* as “a sweet, pleasant, agreeable enough\nstory, but does not have the same appeal as is expected by the readers\nof the other D’Annunzio stories. With us it has always run far behind\nany of the other four books in sales; whereas, THE INTRUDER has always\nrun neck and neck in demand with THE CHILD OF PLEASURE, and almost up to\nthe two leaders—THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH and THE FLAME OF LIFE.” He\nconcluded: “D’Annunzio’s following want sex stuff. THE INTRUDER and the\nother three volumes are sex novels. D’Annunzio’s following do not want\nchildren’s stories. THE MAIDENS OF THE ROCKS is a childish story” (Page\nto Cerf, 7 February 1927).\n\nCerf wrote later, “I very much doubt whether we will ever include ‘The\nIntruder’ in the Modern Library. . . . We are inclined to mark up the\nadvance royalty we paid you on this title as a loss. I have a strong\nfeeling that four D’Annunzio titles are too many as it is in a library\nwith a total of less than 150 books” (Cerf to Page, 15 November 1927).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nD’Annunzio, *Flame of Life* (1918–1936) 62<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Triumph of Death* (1923–1931) 102<br>\nD’Annunzio, *Child of Pleasure* (1925–1931) 113"

Discontinued\n1976/77.\n\nMelville was regarded as a minor American author before the 1920s. The\nLibrary of Congress classification for American Literature, the PS’s,\npublished in 1915, assigns a range of 49 numbers each to\nnineteenth-century American authors who were perceived as first rank.\nEmerson and Hawthorne have ranges of 49 numbers, as does John Greenleaf\nWhittier. Works by and about Hawthorne are classified within the range\nPS 1850‑1898, for example. In contrast, Melville is assigned a range of\nnine numbers (PS 2380‑2388). This reflects Melville’s reputation in\n1915, when he was regarded primarily as a minor author of South Sea\nromances like *Typee* and *Omoo*. *Moby-Dick* sold poorly when it was\npublished in 1851 and was out of print by 1887.\n\nThe critical reevaluation of Melville began in the 1920s with the\npublication of Raymond Weaver’s biography, *Herman Melville: Mariner and\nMystic* (George H. Doran, 1921), followed by the first publication of\n*Billy Budd*, a major work that Melville left in semi-final form. Weaver\nedited the manuscript and published it in *Billy Budd and Other Prose\nPieces* (London: Constable, 1924); a revised version appeared four years\nlater in *Shorter Novels of Herman Melville* (Horace Liveright, 1928).\n\nWeaver had been one of Cerf’s favorite professors at Columbia. His\nbiography of Melville was published a year or two after Cerf graduated\nwith a degree in journalism. In his posthumously published\nautobiography, based on oral history interviews conducted by Columbia\nUniversity’s Oral History Office, Cerf states: “Raymond Weaver’s course\nin Comparative Literature was extraordinary. Inside of three weeks this\nman had even the athletes reading Dante and Cervantes and Melville . . .\nand discussing them with deep interest. He was a persuasive teacher and\na wonderfully nice man” (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 17–18).\n\nWeaver wrote introductions to two editions of *Moby-Dick* that were\npublished as the revival of interest in Melville was getting under way.\nHis introduction to the edition published by Albert & Charles Boni in\n1925 is completely different from the introduction he wrote the\nfollowing year for the ML.\n\nThe ML may have tried to position its edition of *Moby-Dick* to appeal\nboth to readers looking for escapist romance and those who appreciated\nthe darker, allegorical aspects of Melville’s work. The quote from\nMasefield on the front panel of jacket A refers to “this wild, beautiful\nromance” and to Melville’s having “drawn into his tale all the magic,\nall the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters.” In contrast, Weaver’s\nintroduction refers to Melville’s having chosen “as a symbol of the\nmalice and terror that he felt at the core of existence . . . a whale of\nleperous \\[*sic*\\] whiteness” and to “Melville’s dark intent” (p. vii).\n\nSales of *Moby Dick* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 20th\nout of 147 ML titles. During the 18-month period May 1942‑October 1943\nit was in the middle of the first quarter of ML titles in terms of\nsales. It ranked 29th out of 360 titles during the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952. A complete list of ML printings of *Moby\nDick* from January 1931 through October 1944 shows a surge of demand\nfollowing American entry into the Second World War. There were eleven\nprintings between 1931 and 1941 totaling 26,000 copies (an average of\n2,360 copies a year) and seven printings between 1942 and 1944 totaling\n23,000 copies (an average of 7,660 copies a year).\n\nCerf and Klopfer used the ML plates for a 1931 printing of *Moby Dick*\nunder the imprint Carlton House, which was used mainly for dollar\n“specials” intended for sale in department stores. The 1931 Carlton\nHouse titles included at least 13 titles printed from ML plates. In a\ndeparture from the usual format, the 1931 titles used good quality\npaper, were bound in green, blue, or maroon leather, had gilt tops, and\nwere sold in black slipcases at a retail price of $2.50. The ML printed\n500 copies of each title. The books were placed in leading department\nstores in major cities as an experiment. Most of the stores did not do\nwell with the books. One of the ML’s sales representatives indicated\nthat they would have been all right before the Crash, but 1931 “was one\nof those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to\nCerf, 18 August 1932).\n\nThe ML also published *Moby Dick* (G65) in 1944 in the Giants series,\nusing plates of the RH edition illustrated by Rockwell Kent.\n\nAll ML editions of Melville’s novel, including the Giant, use the\nspelling “Moby Dick” on the title page and throughout the text instead\nof the conventional hyphenated spelling “Moby-Dick.” Most editions of\nthe work, including the 1851 first printing and the 1983 Library of\nAmerica edition, use the hyphen, but there are other reputable editions\nthat omit it.\n\nThe Modern Library paperback edition, published in 2000 from a new\ntypesetting with Kent’s illustrations and an introduction by Elizabeth\nHardwick, is inconsistent. The title is *Moby-Dick or, The Whale*, but\nthe biographical note (pp. v–vi) refers to Melville’s novel as *Moby\nDick*, without the hyphen. Hardwick’s introduction uses the hyphenated\nform when referring to the title of the book and the unhyphenated form\nwhen referring to the whale. The Library of America edition (1983),\nwhich includes *Redburn* and *White-Jacket* as well as *Moby-Dick*, uses\nthe hyphen as part of the title, and the running heads on verso pages\n(pp. 774–1406) are MOBY-DICK. Running heads on recto pages record\nchapter titles. Chapter 41 is titled “Moby Dick” without the hyphen,\nwith the result that running heads on recto pages of Chapter 41 (pp.\n985–991) are MOBY DICK.\n\n"

(*Fall 1954*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita pictorial jacket in deep blue (179), deep reddish\norange (36) and black on coated white paper with inset wood engraving of\nwhale destroying a whaling boat; lettering in deep blue, deep reddish\norange and black, all against white background.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> “*Moby Dick* possesses an unusual, if not unique, literary form which\n> cannot be compared to that of the conventional novel, drama or travel\n> book. It is a realistic story of life aboard a whaling vessel, a\n> romance of adventure and strange characters, a drama of heroic\n> determination and conflict and a technical treatise on whaling. . . .\n> Because of its unconventional complexity, it is a disturbing\n> book. . . . Like all great books, *Moby Dick* has the potentiality of\n> enriching itself with the substance of each new reader’s emotions and\n> ideas, and it has grown greater in its implications with the passage\n> of time.” —from the Introduction by Leon Howard\n\nOriginally published with the Howard introduction in MLCE (1950) and\nsubsequently in the regular ML. Professor Austin Warren of the\nUniversity of Michigan was originally invited to write the introduction.\nHe agreed to a deadline of 30 March and a $200 fee but withdrew two days\nbefore it was due, pleading illness and expressing dissatisfaction with\nthe fee compared to the royalty offered by the competing series Rinehart\nEditions (Albert Erskine to Warren, 26 January 1950; Warren to Erskine,\n28 March 1950). Erskine turned to Leon Howard, then at Northwestern\nUniversity, who agreed to write the introduction for the $200 fee\n(Erskine to Howard, 31 March 1950).\n\nMelville’s dedication to Nathaniel Hawthorne, omitted from earlier ML\nprintings, is included in 124c.\n\n"

The Modern\n> Library edition, containing a new introduction by the author, and\n> certain revisions that he deemed vital in the text, will undoubtedly\n> win a tremendous new audience for the book. (*Fall 1926*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1922. The B&L plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format; ML edition printed from plates made from a\nnew typesetting with revisions by the author. Published October 1926.\n*WR* 20 November 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1940.\n\nSales of *Up Stream* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 36th\nout of 147 ML titles.\n\nKlopfer invited Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New\nYork, to write the introduction. “Our honorarium for such an\nintroduction is only fifty dollars,” he noted, “but we would really like\nto have your name among the people who have written introductions to our\nvolumes” (Klopfer to Wise, 18 December 1925). Wise replied that he had\nnot liked *Up Stream* but would be willing to write an introduction to a\nML edition of Lewisohn’s *Israel* (Wise to Klopfer, 21 December 1925).\nIn the end Lewisohn wrote his own introduction to the ML edition.\n\nLewisohn took advantage of the new typesetting to revise the text. He\ninformed Klopfer: “The revision of the book is a matter of great moral\nand literary importance to me . . . I shall write a fairly extended—not\ntoo extended—new introduction etc. At all events you shall have the book\nin such shape as I should wish it to be read in the future” (Lewisohn to\nKlopfer, 26 June 1926). The passages Lewisohn revised concerned his\nmarriage to Mary Lewisohn, from whom he had recently separated. He\nremoved a number of references to his wife from the ML text and rewrote\nothers. In the B&L edition, for example, after noting that he sold his\nfourth story to *Uncle Remus’s Magazine* for $125, Lewisohn wrote:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> My mother’s womanly and solitary heart yearned over Mary. So Mary and\n> I were married and we all settled down in an old, roomy house in\n> Queenshaven. The house overlooked the bay and from our study windows\n> Mary and I watched the horned moon float over the silken swell of the\n> dark waters and listened to the tide. . . . (B&L, p. 135; suspension\n> points are in the original of all quoted passages from the B&L and ML\n> texts).\n\nLewisohn revised the passage as follows for the ML edition:\n\n> My father was, characteristically, aglow; he saw visions of grandeur.\n> Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\n> and her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner. I was\n> sorry, helpless and confused. I tried to hope that my mother would be\n> less lonely. I tried to hope many things to still the fatal monitions\n> within me. . . .\n>\n> We all settled down together in an old house overlooking the bay. I\n> think that, in spite of youth and inexperience and their faults, I\n> tried to make the best of things. But Mary’s responsibilities to her\n> family robbed her of the power, even though she had had the will, to\n> be my wife or—despite her age, the daughter of my parents. It was\n> perhaps not all her fault that she was a burden and unhelpful; it was\n> absurd that, under these circumstances, she had neither humility nor\n> true kindness, but was as exacting as a bride of eighteen. She was a\n> middle-aged woman who had insisted on marrying a man not much older\n> than her oldest child. She acted like Dora Copperfield. . . .\n> Something indomitable must have been in me that I did not go under\n> . . . a strength and a faith. . . . (128a, pp. 159–60)\n\nA complete inventory of changes in the ML text that have been noted are\nthe following, with the page of the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition given\nfirst, followed by the corresponding page of the 1926 Modern Library\nprinting: pp. 131/154; 135–36/159–60; 138/162; 141/167; 145/171;\n146/172; 148/175; 150/177; 154/181–82; 177/210; 180/214; 187/222;\n188/223; 189/225; 218/263; 221/266.\n\nWhen Mary Lewisohn saw the revised edition of *Up Stream* she threatened\nto sue the ML for libel. She specifically objected to the passage:\n“Mary, furthermore, insisted that we must be married to save her honor\nand her very life. I was a gentleman still and a Southerner.” Cerf asked\nLewisohn to write a long letter giving in detail his reasons for\nincluding the sentences. “The entire affair promises to be a dreadful\nnuisance, but the lady is determined in her course and I suppose we will\nall have to go through with it. I await a letter from you at your very\nearliest convenience” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 19 January 1927).\n\n"

The jacket\nstatement somewhat disingenuously covers up the fact that the\nintroduction which Lewisohn wrote for the ML edition was no longer\nincluded.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Burning indignation and the will to find a way into a full creative\n> life have been the essence of Ludwig Lewisohn’s writings. *Up Stream*\n> is at once his spiritual autobiography and the lyrical, yet savage,\n> outcry against the forces that stifled him. It is a book of protest\n> and affirmation, honest, unashamed and electrical with fierce passion.\n> In the literature of America’s coming of age, *Up Stream* occupies a\n> unique place; it is the record of a soul’s awakening and its final\n> declaration of creative independence. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nThe fourth printing was the first to satisfy the requirements of the\nML’s agreement with Mary Lewisohn without resorting to cancellation.\nLewisohn had made many small changes in the text when he revised *Up\nStream* for the ML, and a number of these remained in the ML text after\nthose that Mary Lewisohn objected to had been removed. Cerf wrote to\nLudwig Lewisohn in 1936 that *Up Stream* continued to sell at the rate\nof 1,000 copies or more each year “and considering the length of time\nthat the book has been in print, I regard that as a pretty gratifying\nrecord” (Cerf to Lewisohn, 13 November 1936).\n\nThree other books by Lewisohn appeared in the ML. *A Modern Book of\nCriticism* (75), an original ML anthology that he edited, was published\nin spring 1920 and remained in print through 1936. *The Story of\nAmerican Literature* (G43), originally published as *Expression in\nAmerica*, was added to the Giants in spring 1939. Lewisohn began to\nlobby for the inclusion of his novel *The Island Within* shortly after\nthe Giant was published. Cerf thought that two Lewisohn titles in the\nseries were “more than enough” but suggested that *Up Stream* might be\ndropped and *The Island Within* published in its place. Lewisohn\napproved “with all the vociferousness at his command” (Cerf to Cass\nCanfield, Harper & Bros., 12 October 1939). *The Island Within* (329)\nsold poorly and was discontinued two and a half years later.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewisohn, ed., *A Modern Book of Criticism* (1920–1936) 75\n\nLewisohn, *Story of American Literature* (Giant, 1939–1956) G43\n\nLewisohn, *The Island Within* (1940–1942) 329"

(*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The charming vagaries of the inhabitants of James Branch Cabell’s\n> mythical world are, like our own, gropings and blunderings toward the\n> illusion of a better way of life. Guided by this sceptical and urbane\n> philosopher, this man of humor and uncanny insight, we explore the\n> enchanted kingdom of Poictesme, following the adventures of Felix\n> Kennaston in quest of the eternal “something else.” Through the\n> allegory of *The Cream of the Jest* we discover something of what is\n> in this world and in the worlds desired by men. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Robert M. McBride & Co., 1917; new\nbibliographical edition 1922 (the fifth McBride printing) with\nintroduction by Harold Ward added and “slight revisions and additions”\n(Brussel, p. 55) in the text. ML edition (pp. \\[v\\]–250), including\nWard’s introduction, printed from plates of the second McBride\ntypesetting with McBride half title used as a fly title in early ML\nprintings. Publication announced for January 1927. *WR* 12 March 1927.\nFirst printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1940.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Cream of the Jest* as early as July\n1925, but only as a second choice if he was unable to get Cabell’s\n*Jurgen* for the ML. At that time McBride was thinking about publishing\na “cheap edition of all of Cabell’s books, and for that reason we do not\nwant to do anything that would militate against the sale of such an\nedition” (Guy Holt, McBride, to Cerf, 24 August 1925). The cheap edition\nnever appeared, and McBride authorized a ML edition of *The Cream of the\nJest* the following year. *Jurgen* (271) was not included in the ML\nuntil 1934.\n\nThe first ML printing was in November 1926, unusually early for a title\nannounced for January publication. November 1926 was also the date of\nthe eighth McBride printing, so the ML may have joined the McBride print\nrun. (The verso of the title pages of 131 and 131 variant A state\n“*Eighth Printing* | *First Modern Library Edition* | *1927*”.) This\nmight explain the inclusion of the outdated subject index in the first\nML printing. The ML subject index in 131 and the spring 1927 list in 131\nvariant A occupy the same number of pages, but plates for the ML’s\nspring lists usually weren’t available as early as November.\n\nIn addition to the first printing of 8,000 copies, the RH archives\n(which may be incomplete) record printings of 5,000 copies each in\nAugust 1927 and September 1928, a printing of 2,000 copies in May 1930,\nand printings of 1,000 copies each in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1937,\nfor a total of at least 25,000 copies.\n\nSales of *The Cream of the Jest* during the first six months of 1928\nplaced it 33rd out of 147 ML titles.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nCabell, *Beyond Life* (1923–1935) 104<br>\nCabell, *Jurgen* (1934–1943) 271<br>"

They\nasked for rights to the translation for ten years and wanted assurance\nthat Macmillan would not put *Ecce Homo* into its series of inexpensive\nreprints, Modern Readers Series (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr.,\nMacmillan, 2 June 1926). Macmillan had to submit the offer to its parent\nfirm in London but the response was slow in coming.\n\nAfter waiting four months Cerf and Klopfer decided to commission their\nown translation (Klopfer to Brett, 5 October 1926). Irwin Edman of\nColumbia University was asked to suggest a translator. He recommended\nHorace Freiss, a colleague in the Philosophy Department. Freiss\nindicated that he could do it within six months, but this was longer\nthan they wanted to wait. Edman then suggested Clifton Fadiman, one of\nhis graduate students. Fadiman agreed to undertake the translation of\n*Ecce Homo* and *The Birth of Tragedy* and to submit the manuscript by 6\nDecember.\n\nApproval for use of the Macmillan translation arrived from London in\nmid-October, but Cerf and Klopfer had already made arrangements with\nFadiman (Brett to Cerf, 14 October 1926; Cerf to Brett, 21 October\n1926). Fadiman submitted his translation shortly after the deadline but\nin time for February publication. Cerf later noted that the ML edition\nof *Ecce Homo & The Birth of Tragedy* was the first time Fadiman’s name\nwas attached to a literary work (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 22 May 1943, p.\n37).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nNietzsche, *Thus Spake Zarathustra* (1917–) 9<br>\nNietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* (1917–1936) 28<br>\nNietzsche, *Genealogy of Morals* (1918–1936) 59<br>\nNietzsche, *Philosophy* (Giant, 1937–1970) G32<br>\nNietzsche, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1968–) G113<br>"

Several later printings of\n136a are about ¼ inch taller and wider than the standard format. Narrow\nmargins were sometimes unavoidable when the ML printed from other\npublishers’ plates, but it was unusual for a typesetting designed for\nthe ML to have such narrow margins.

But Mr. Ratner has had the happy thought to set the\n> extracts from Spinoza’s *Ethics* between selections from his more\n> popular writings on the scriptures, miracles, etc., on one hand, and\n> his views of the state, government, freedom of thought and speech,\n> etc., on the other. This fact alone illuminates the value of Spinoza’s\n> thought for the present in an extraordinary way. I shall be\n> disappointed if Mr. Ratner’s volume does not have a marked influence\n> in bringing Spinoza out of the professional class-room and enabling\n> him to serve as a precious companion to men and women who need the\n> light and leading which he can give.” —<span class=\"smallcaps\">John\n> Dewey</span>.

He was a lecturer and doctoral student in the philosophy\ndepartment at Columbia when he compiled *The Philosophy of Spinoza*. He\nreceived his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930.\n\nCerf asked Morris R. Cohen of the City College of New York to comment on\nRatner’s manuscript. Cohen suggested leaving out some of the sections on\nBiblical interpretation and substituting “some sections from the tract\non Politics e.g. the section of government by law in a democracy. I\nbelieve the latter will interest ‘Modern’ readers more than the\nexcessive amount devoted to biblical interpretation” (Cohen to Cerf, 6\nOctober 1926). A few months after publication Cerf wrote, “Spinoza\ncontinues to sell far in excess of our expectations” (Cerf to Ratner, 7\nJune 1927).\n\nIn April 1940, when he was an instructor at City College of New York,\nRatner sold his rights to *The Philosophy of Spinoza* and John Dewey’s\n*Intelligence in the Modern World* (G41) for $500. He also retained the\nunearned advance for the Dewey volume, which had been published the\nprevious year; the unearned advance appears to have amounted to $700.\nThe two books became the absolute property of the ML, and Ratner\nreceived no further royalties. He had the option to buy back the\ncontracts at any time within the next two years for $1,200 minus\nroyalties accrued from 1 January 1940.\n\n"

Publication\nannounced for April 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1931.\n\nIt is not known why Cerf and Klopfer published *The House with the Green\nShutters* under the author’s full name rather than his better-known\npseudonym George Douglas.\n\nSeltzer described *The House with the Green Shutters* as follows: “. . .\nthis famous and extraordinary novel, from which, it is held, all modern\nfiction derives. It was the only long novel written by the young\nScotchman before his early death. It came out in 1900, and was the first\nbook that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and\nmoods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were\nequally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction\nto the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels\nwritten in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make\ntwenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the\nModern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926).\n\nBroun agreed to write the introduction (Broun to Cerf, 31 October 1926)\nbut failed to submit it by the deadline. The Blake introduction used in\nits place was originally written as an article for the British\nperiodical *John O’London’s Weekly* (8 March 1924, pp. 809–10) and never\ncopyrighted in the United States. Cerf took Blake’s article, probably at\nthe last moment, revised the opening paragraph, added a reference to the\nML edition, and forwarded it to the printer. The origin of the\nintroduction was not acknowledged and Blake received no payment for its\nuse. When Blake learned that the ML had used his work he wrote a letter\nof protest to *Saturday Review of Literature* (“A Writer’s Grievance,”\n*SRL*, 10 September 1927, p. 110).\n\nCerf and Klopfer did everything they could to popularize *The House with\nthe Green Shutters*, including distributing a portion of the first\nprinting at the American Booksellers’ Convention in May 1927, but it\nfailed to attract a wide audience. The first Modern Library printing of\n8,000 copies was larger than average. Cerf and Klopfer ordered a second\nprinting of 1,000 copies in April 1930, apparently still hoping that it\nmight catch on, then admitted defeat and discontinued the book at the\nend of the year."

Discontinued 1 January 1933.\n\nEdmund Wilson described Gourmont as “the most distinguished critical\nchampion of the \\[Symbolist\\] movement” (*Axel’s Castle*, p. 22).\n\nHuxley’s translation of *A Virgin Heart* appeared in the U.S. five years\nbefore Allen & Unwin published it in Britain.\n\nThe ML paid Greenberg royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 5,000\ncopies and 4 cents a copy thereafter. Cerf asked Huxley, who translated\n*A Virgin Heart*, to write an introduction to the ML edition. Huxley\ndeclined on the grounds that he was very busy and would have to refresh\nhis memory of *A Virgin Heart* and Gourmont’s other books (Huxley to\nCerf, 29 March 1927). The ML edition was published without an\nintroduction.\n\nGreenberg wanted to remainder 700 copies of its edition less than a year\nafter the ML edition was published. Cerf asked Greenberg to refrain,\nnoting that a remainder sale “would have a disastrous effect upon our\nModern Library edition of this book, and would not be living up to the\nspirit of the agreement that you made with us. . . . Our sale of this\ntitle has been none too spectacular” (Cerf to R. I. Warshow, Greenberg,\n21 October 1927).\n\nThere were four subsequent printings of 1,000 copies each between\nNovember 1928 and December 1931. After *A Virgin Heart* was\ndiscontinued, Cerf described it as “a complete failure in the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Warshow, 24 May 1933). Ten thousand copies were sold,\nmost of them when it was new in the series (Cerf to Warshow, 19 June\n1933).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span><br>\nGourmont, *Night in the Luxembourg* (1926–1932) 125"

(*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1927. *WR* 22 October 1927.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nShortly after publication of *The Philosophy of William James* (119)\nCerf invited Horace M. Kallen to edit a similar volume devoted to\nBertrand Russell (Cerf to Kallen, 23 December 1925). Kallen appears to\nhave declined, and Manuel Komroff took on the role of editorial midwife\nto the collection. Russell, in return for a full royalty, was supposed\nto select the contents and secure permissions from the original\npublishers. He seems to have had little interest in the project beyond\nwriting the introduction, however, and Komroff ended up doing most of\nthe editorial work. When the introduction arrived Cerf wrote Komroff:\n\n> There seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the Bertrand Russell\n> matter. He evidently believes that when he submitted his introduction\n> to us, and vaguely O.K.’d the list of suggestions you sent him last\n> Spring, his work would be entirely finished. I have just written him,\n> however, that we want a very definite list from him as to what\n> selections should be included in the volume. . . . He knows so much\n> better than we do what really significant passages in his works are!”\n> (Cerf to Komroff, 25 August 1926)\n\nKomroff replied with some exasperation that Russell “is all wet.” He\nwent on:\n\n> I took the trouble to make a catalogue of his popular books and mark\n> to \\[*sic*\\] essays that were my favorites and in my mind had endured.\n> The whole sceme \\[*sic*\\] was my idea in the first place and it would\n> have been a simple matter for me to have put together a nice little\n> volume of Russell’s Writings. But I figured it out; and there is so\n> much work in the world that one can do that I thought if anything\n> could be made on it the money should go to the author. But the dam\n> \\[*sic*\\] hog never wrote me a line to even acknowledge the long list\n> I had made out . . . (Komroff to Cerf, 15 September 1926).\n\n"

The storm that\n> broke when the book was published has never subsided, of course, and\n> to orthodox Catholics it is still a creation of the devil. Their\n> outcry that no one who did not admit the divinity of Jesus was\n> qualified to write about him found expressions in diatribes singularly\n> comparable to the current expressions of our Fundamentalist friends.\n> John Haynes Holmes’ introduction appears exclusively in the Modern\n> Library edition of this book. (*Fall 1927*)\n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Even more a work of art than a history, Ernest Renan’s *Life of Jesus*\n> was the first biography of the Nazarene in the modern historical and\n> literary sense, and it is still the best. The unprecedented sensation\n> created when the book was published in 1863 has not yet subsided. Its\n> most vehement antagonists and its most ardent admirers are in complete\n> accord on the immense fund of learning and the consummate artistry\n> with which Ernest Renan re-created the humble life of Christ and the\n> beginnings of the Christian era. (*Spring 1937*)\n\nThe ML used the translation by William G. Hutchinson, which was\noriginally published in the U.S. by A. L. Burt Co. around 1898. ML\nedition (pp. \\[*5*–*7*\\], vii–ix, 25–393) printed from Burt plates with\nHutchinson’s biographical sketch of Renan omitted, heading of p. \\[*5*\\]\nreset, and table of contents revised to include Holmes’s introduction.\nPublished December 1927. *WR* 7 January 1928. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\nTwo other English translations were available besides Hutchinson’s. *The\nLife of Jesus* was originally published in the U.S. by G. W. Carleton,\n1874, in a translation by Charles Edwin Wilbour. A revised translation\nby the Biblical scholar Joseph Henry Allen, which was based on the 23rd\nFrench edition and made use of the Wilbour and Hutchinson translations,\nwas published by Roberts Brothers in 1896 and subsequently by Little,\nBrown. The ML chose the less authoritative Hutchinson translation on\neconomic grounds. The Allen translation was copyrighted and would have\nrequired royalty payments. The Wilbour translation was in the public\ndomain, but the Roberts Brothers/Little, Brown plates were too large for\nthe ML’s format. By buying a duplicate set of plates of the Hutchinson\ntranslation from the A. L. Burt Co. the ML was able to avoid paying\nroyalties and the cost of resetting the text.\n\nKlopfer noted in 1943 that “some of our plates are pretty bad. . . . The\nRenan, for instance . . . shouldn’t be used for anything anymore”\n(Klopfer to Cerf, 4 July 1943, Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University\nLibrary; published in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, p.\n87, with Renan transcribed from Klopfer’s difficult handwriting as\n“Renoir”). The bad plates continued to be used into the 1960s.\n\nHolmes, minister of the Community Church in New York City, received $50\nfor the introduction.\n\n"

(*Spring 1935*)\n\n*The Emperor Jones* and *The Straw* originally published by Boni &\nLiveright, 1921, in a volume with O’Neill’s *Diff’rent*. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced\nfor April 1928. *WR* 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1937. Superseded February 1937 by *The Emperor\nJones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape* (299).\n\nDudley Nichols of the *New York World* wrote the introduction after\nO’Neill declined to write it himself (Cerf to O’Neill, 7 December 1927;\nCerf to Nichols, 7 February 1928).\n\nO’Neill made several revisions in the text of *The Emperor Jones* when\nhe prepared it for *The Complete Works of Eugene O’Neill* (2 vols., Boni\n& Liveright, 1924). The most notable were the cutting of speeches by\nSmithers at the end of Scene One and the end of the play. In the revised\nversion Scene One ends as follows:\n\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">Smithers \\[</span>*Looks after him with a\n> puzzled admiration*\\]: ’E’s got ’is bloomin’ nerve with ’im, s’elp me.\n> \\[*Then angrily*.\\] Ho—the bleedin’ nigger—puttin’ on ’is bloody airs!\n> I ’opes they naps ’im an’ gives ’im an’ gives ’im what’s what!\n\nThe original version continues:\n\n> \\[*Then putting business before the pleasure of this thought, looking\n> around him with cupidity.*\\] A bloke ought to find a ’ole lot in this\n> palace that’d go for a bit of cash.

The 1972 Vintage Books edition of *The Emperor Jones,\nAnna Christie, The Hairy Ape*, which superseded the Modern Library\nedition and is printed from plates made from a new typesetting, uses the\noriginal text. The original version also appears in *Six Modern American\nPlays* (441).\n\nIn contrast, O’Neill’s *Nine Plays* (G53), published in 1941 as a ML\nGiant and printed from plates originally used by Liveright, Inc. in 1932\nand later by Random House, has the revised version of *The Emperor\nJones*. The revised version also appears in the 3-volume *Plays of\nEugene O’Neill* (624), published in the ML in 1982. The 3-volume edition\nwas originally published by Random House in 1941 and revised in 1951\nwhen *The Iceman Cometh* was added.\n\n*The Emperor Jones; The Straw*, with sales of 3,622 copies, was the 14th\nbest-selling ML title during the first six months of 1928. Sales through\n1932 were as follows: 5,855 copies (1928); 2,901 copies (1929); 1,921\ncopies (1930); 1,405 copies (1931); 756 copies (1932) (Cerf to O’Neill,\n2 June 1933).\n\nThe ML paid royalties to Boni & Liveright of 10 cents a copy.\n\nO’Neill became a Random House author after the Liveright bankruptcy in\n1933. Saxe Commins, his editor at Liveright, also moved to Random House.\nIn choosing between Coward-McCann and Random House, O’Neill wrote:\n\n> Cerf . . . has drive and enthusiasm, coupled with keen shrewdness.\n> Moreover, I felt Coward was trade publisher, pure and simple—but Cerf\n> has more to his publishing than that, a love of beautiful books, an\n> appreciation for good literature, an ambition to keep his firm above\n> the level of the others, to expand only along lines of distinction.\n> That, of course, appealed strongly to me. As for background for my\n> stuff, there is no comparison. . . . Cerf has two unique things—Modern\n> Library and Random House.\n\nHe also thought Random House would offer better opportunities for\nCommins:\n\n> I feel strongly that Cerf is the better bet for your present and\n> future . . . with him, you will have a real chance to do your stuff\n> and a most congenial atmosphere. . . . With Cerf you’ll undoubtedly be\n> called upon to contribute real imagination and judgment of real\n> writing, once you’ve fitted in there (O’Neill to Commins, June 1933;\n> in Commins, ed., *“Love and Admiration and Respect”*, pp. 159-60).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nO’Neill, *Moon of the Caribbees and Six Other Plays of the Sea*\n(1923–1940) 101\n\nO’Neill, *Emperor Jones, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape* (1937–1971) 299\n\nO’Neill, *Long Voyage Home* (1940–1971) 101e\n\nO’Neill, *Nine Plays* (Giant, 1941– ) G53\n\nO’Neill, *Ah, Wilderness! and Two Other Plays* (1964–1973) 559\n\nO’Neill, *Plays of Eugene O’Neill*, 3 vols.

(*Spring 1932*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1919. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*1*\\]–360) printed from B&L plates with contents page omitted.\nPublication announced for June 1928. *WR* 4 August 1928. First (and\nonly) printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1934.\n\nCerf negotiated the ML edition directly with Dreiser, who controlled the\nrights to *Twelve Men*. He initially offered Dreiser an advance of\n$1,200 against royalties of 12 cents a copy (Cerf to Dreiser, 6 October\n1927). The reprint agreement dated 13 October 1927 provided for\nroyalties of 11 cents a copy to Dreiser and 1 cent a copy to B&L for the\nuse of their plates. B&L received $200 for approving the ML reprint;\nthis appears to have been an advance against the plate rental and was\ndeducted from the advance initially offered to Dreiser, who received\n$1,000 when the contract was signed.\n\nDreiser wanted to use H. L. Mencken’s review in the *New York Sun* (13\nApril 1919) as an introduction to the ML edition. Cerf offered Mencken\n$50 for permission to reprint it (Cerf to Mencken, 4 November 1927), but\nMencken either declined or did not reply. He then asked Sinclair Lewis\nto write the introduction. Lewis indicated that he liked *Twelve Men*\nvery much but had no time since he was just beginning a new novel (Cerf\nto Sinclair Lewis, 13 December 1927; Lewis to Cerf, 3 January 1928).\nCharles Merz of the *New York World* also declined (Merz to Cerf, 9\nFebruary 1928). The introduction was finally written by Robert O. Ballou\nof the *Chicago Daily News*, who began it with the words, “Dreiser ought\nto be doing this himself” (p. v).\n\nSales of the ML edition were disappointing. *Twelve Men* ranked 34th\namong the best-selling titles in the ML during the first six months of\n1928 with sales of 2,358 copies, most of which were advance sales. Sales\nfell off steadily thereafter. A memo in the RH Papers (Box 77, Dreiser\nfile) indicates a total sale of 9,749 copies as follows: 4,718 copies\n(1928); 1,837 copies (1929); 1,546 copies (1930); 681 copies (1931); 421\ncopies (1932); 380 copies (1933); and 166 copies (to October 1934).\n\nSeveral years after the ML edition was discontinued, Dreiser wrote that\n*Twelve Men* was no longer available in any edition. “My publishers,\nSimon and Schuster, have consistently refused, because of my inability\nto furnish them with a third volume of the Cowperwood Trilogy, to keep\nmy works in print or to distribute them, and since that leaves me\nwithout a publisher other than yourself I would like to arrange for, at\nleast, a reprint of this volume” (Dreiser to Cerf, 4 April 1939). Cerf\nexplained why *Twelve Men* had been discontinued and added, “I believe\nthat one of the main reasons that the Modern Library has remained\npopular all these years is that we have taken out the slow-moving titles\neach year and allowed the booksellers to return them for full credit,\nthereby assuring them a fresh stock with a turnover that warrants their\nkeeping the line in a prominent position in their stores” (Cerf to\nDreiser, 10 April 1939).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nDreiser, *Free and Other Stories* (1924–1931) 106\n\nDreiser, *Sister Carrie* (1932–1971) 230\n\nDreiser, *American Tragedy* (Giant, 1956–1968) G89"

Discontinued fall 1936.\n\nThe ML’s regular printers did letterpress printing only. The verso of\nthe title page states: “*Printed by the* <span\nclass=\"smallcaps\">aquatone process</span> *by* | *Edward Stern &\nCompany, Inc.*”\n\nThere were at least two printings of *The Art of Whistler*. The\nstatement “*First Modern Library Edition* | 1928” appears to have been\nretained on all ML printings. The “First Modern Library Edition”\nstatement was usually removed from letterpress plates after the first\nprinting; ML books printed by offset processes typically retained such\nstatements on all printings.\n\nThe ML volume is “essentially a miniature version of the Pennells’\nprevious biography of the life of Whistler” (Getscher and Marks, p. 97).\n*The Life of James McNeill Whistler* by Elizabeth Robins Pennell and\nJoseph Pennell was originally published in two volumes by J. B.\nLippincott (1908) and appeared in a one-volume revised version in 1911.\nJoseph Pennell died in 1926. Cerf invited Elizabeth Robins Pennell to\nedit and arrange a short version for the ML, and she prepared the\nmanuscript on her own.\n\nKlopfer had vivid memories of the publication of the book. Cerf lost the\nmanuscript that Mrs. Pennell had submitted and insisted on a coin toss\nto determine which of the two partners would convey the bad news to the\nauthor. Cerf won the toss, and Klopfer went to see Mrs. Pennell at her\nhome in Brooklyn to explain what had happened. He was then in his\nmid-twenties, and the author was in her early seventies. Klopfer\nstruggled to get around to the purpose of the visit; finally Mrs.\nPennell said, “Young man, are you trying to tell me you lost the\nmanuscript?”—and produced a back-up copy (Klopfer to Cerf, 20 November\n1942; Klopfer interview with GBN, 5 July 1978).\n\nShortly after publication of *The Art of Whistler* Klopfer invited Mrs.\nPennell to edit a companion volume, *The Art of Joseph Pennell* (Klopfer\nto Pennell, 9 March 1929), but the projected volume was never submitted.\n\nKlopfer offered Allen Lane, who distributed several ML titles in Britain\nbefore he founded Penguin Books in 1935, 1,000 unbound copies of *The\nArt of Whistler* in sheets at 30 cents a set, which, he noted, “is darn\nnear our actual cost.” He added, “We lose money on this book, but as we\ndon’t sell very many it doesn’t make much difference” (Klopfer to Lane,\n11 August 1931). In contrast, Suetonius’s *Lives of the Twelve Caesars*\n(217), which was 150 pages longer than the Whistler volume but had no\nillustrations, could be supplied in sheets at 20 cents a set.\n\n***Fall***"

There were other problems as\nwell. In one letter he told Cerf, “I had worked about six hours a day\nfor a week on Rabelais . . . and then you told me the whole thing must\nbe expurgated” (Douglas to Cerf, 6 October 1927). When he finally\nsubmitted the manuscript he exclaimed, “It was the hardest job I ever\ndid in my life” (Douglas to Cerf, 4 January 1928).\n\nDouglas commented on the expurgation in the introduction: “To cleanse\nRabelais (as is done in the present edition) is not, as H. G. Wells\nwould say, like cleaning rabbits for the table. It is like cleaning the\nimmense Augean stables. It is like purifying the fertility of the earth\nor turning the curious and inventive mind into a glass house for fear of\nstones. By the laws of our own age it has become necessary and\nobligatory” (pp. ix–x). Douglas’s edition was superseded in 1944 by\n*The* *Complete Works* *of Rabelais* (G66) in an unabridged translation\nby Jacques Le Clercq.\n\n*Gargantua and Pantagruel* ranked in the middle of the third quarter of\nML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942‑October\n1943.\n\nThe ML plates were used by Walter J. Black, Inc., for an undated\nprinting.\n\n"

(*Spring\n> 1934*)\n\nTranslation by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson originally published in U.S. by John\nLane, 1914, and from 1922 by Dodd, Mead & Co. ML edition (pp. \\[1–4\\],\n7–348) printed from a duplicate set of Lane/Dodd, Mead plates with\nrunning heads removed and original page numerals in the headline\nreplaced by smaller numerals placed closer to the text. Published\nSeptember 1928. *WR* 13 October 1928. First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1939.\n\nThe Dodd, Mead trade edition of *The Revolt of the Angels* was an\nattractive volume with a trim size of 8½ x 5⅝ inches. The type page\n(text and headline) measured 6¼ x 3½ inches, allowing generous margins.\nThe Modern Library wanted to print from Dodd, Mead plates to avoid\ntypesetting and plate making costs. However, the plates produced a type\npage that was barely ⅛ inch shorter than the Modern Library’s standard\ntrim size (6⅝ x 4¼ inches). This was a problem. \\[scan of Dodd, Mead ed.\nw ML Jacket Scans file\\]\n\nIn the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the ML dealt with situations like this by\nphotographing the original publisher’s edition, reducing the size of the\ntype page photographically, and printing by offset lithography. The\nquality of printing was inferior to letterpress and printing costs were\nhigher, but offset lithography saved the cost of a new typesetting. Cerf\nand Klopfer do not appear to have considered offset lithography as an\noption in the 1920s. Marshall Lee states, “The necessary techniques were\ndeveloped in the early part of the century, but it was not until the\n1920s that any considerable commercial printing was done by this method,\nand it was not until after World War II that it became a major book\nprinting industry. The method would have had more use in its early days\nhad it been able to deliver a better result, but the skills were not\nwell enough advanced to avoid the gray, flat quality that marked\nlithography as a ‘cheap’ process” (Lee, *Bookmaking*, 2nd ed., p. 136).\n\nThe Modern Library’s solution was to print from a duplicate set of Dodd,\nMead plates with the running heads removed. The original page numerals\nwere part of the headline, so the Modern Library had to add new page\nnumerals. The added numerals were squeezed uncomfortably close to the\nfirst line of text, and they were set in a different font that was\nsmaller and less compatible with the text than the original numerals.\nMargins on all sides were minimal. The first Modern Library printing was\n⅛ inch taller than the series’ standard format; later printings reverted\nto the standard format with even narrower margins at the foot. The\nresult was the one of worst looking books the Modern Library ever\nproduced.\n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* sold well through 1931 and slowly thereafter.\nThe ML edition was reprinted three times in 1929 and 1930 for a total of\n17,000 copies in print. Between 1931 and 1936 there were three printings\nof 1,000 copies each. Sales totaled 18,915 copies by June 1936, shortly\nbefore the final printing. Subsequent sales were as follows: 366 copies\n(July–December 1936); 344 copies (1937); 319 copies (1938); and 256\ncopies (January–June 1939, after the ML edition was officially\ndiscontinued). The figures for July 1936–June 1939 include the resale of\ncopies returned by booksellers; sales subject to royalty payments during\nthis period totaled 753 copies.\n\n*The Revolt of the Angels* was discontinued in 1938 because of declining\nsales, shortly before the ML introduced a new and larger format designed\nby Joseph Blumenthal that could have accommodated the Dodd, Mead plates\nmore comfortably.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nFrance, *The Red Lily* (1917–1937) 7\n\nFrance, *Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard* (1917–1942) 21\n\nFrance, *Queen Pédauque* (1923–1933) 100\n\nFrance, *Thaïs* (1924–1938) 109\n\nFrance, *Penguin Island* (1933–1970; 1984– ) 253"

Also the pinkish lettering against the white is perhaps not\nstrong enough. Could I recommend that you think in terms of a darker ink\nfor the lettering?” (Miller to Angelo, 15 March 1939).\n\nHarcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, in response to the burgeoning postwar\ncollege market. It served notice that it was terminating the ML’s\nreprint contracts for *Mrs. Dalloway*, *To the Lighthouse*, and seven\nother titles, including works by E. M. Forster, Sinclair Lewis,\nKatherine Anne Porter, and Lytton Strachey (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,\nBrace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 1,400 copies of\n*Mrs. Dalloway* in stock.

In particular this new audience will be\nmade up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words\nstating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in\nthis edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered $100, double\nthe ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the\nlast moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him $50 for an\nintroduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March\n1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the\nend of March.\n\n*The Cabala* sold well during its first two or three years in the\nseries. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and\nanother printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in\nthe RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933."

His story of Julien Sorel is incomparably the most astute\n> and penetrating study of middle-class mores in all fiction. It is, in\n> addition, a relentless dissection of the hypocrisy and opportunism of\n> as unconscionable an upstart as ever violated the Seventh and other\n> Commandments in order to get on in the world. (*Spring 1933*)\n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes\nby Boni & Liveright, 1926. ML edition (pp. v–\\[288\\]; v–\\[352\\]) printed\nfrom B&L plates. Published June 1929. *WR* 13 July 1929. First printing:\n4,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74.

Boni & Liveright was also\ninconsistent in its multi-volume *Works of Stendhal*, hyphenating the\ntranslator’s name on the title page of *The Red and the Black* and\nomitting the hyphen on the title page of *The Charterhouse of Parma* and\nthe jackets of both works.\n\nThe ML paid Liveright royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\n*The Red and the Black* ranked high in the fourth quarter of ML titles\nin terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It\nrose to the first quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952. The dramatic increase in sales may reflect\nuse of *The Red and the Black* in college literature courses after the\nSecond World War, when enrollments increased dramatically as large\nnumbers of veterans took advantage of the G.I.

He\ntold Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an\nintroduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered $100, twice the ML’s\nusual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf\nto Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that *Humphry Clinker*, “the\nwork of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he\nthought that *Roderick Random* was “more characteristically Smollett:\nrough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin\nwith. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with\nhis order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April\n1927).

Her life was consecrated to love. As it was with Shulamite,\nwho inspired Solomon’s Song of Songs, so love had set a seal upon\nLilly’s heart. All the denials of poverty, the violences of lechery and\nthe longings of her own dream world only made her more desirable in the\neyes of men.

ML edition (pp. \\[3\\]–640) printed from\nHuebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title.\nPublished October 1929. *WR* 23 November 1929. First printing: 8,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1 January 1942.\n\nML printings do not identify the translator. Huebsch and Viking\nprintings attribute the translation to Thomas Seltzer, but it was\nactually by his wife Adele Seltzer, who wanted to publicize her\nhusband’s name. Thomas Seltzer’s contribution was typing the manuscript\nthat was submitted to Huebsch (Levin, *Dare to Be Different*, pp. 85,\n269).\n\nThe ML paid Viking royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were three\nadditional printings of 2,000 copies each between April 1930 and April\n1931 and five known printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1932\nand April 1941.\n\nSudermann’s novel was read more widely in the early decades of the 20th\ncentury than it is today. Jackets of early ML printings of *Madame\nBovary* (25.1) state on the front panel: “Today there are two more\nnovels that are likely to be classed with \\[*Madame Bovary*\\] . . .\nTolstoy’s ‘Anna Karenina’ and Sudermann’s ‘Song of Songs.’” (see 25.1a).\n\n"

At\nthis time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering\nresentment over the ML edition of *Green Mansions* (90). However, Cerf\nhad become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying\nto put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928).\nRelations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929\nluncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a $1,000 advance\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy for *Peter Whiffle*. He also\noffered to pay Van Vechten $100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an\nintroduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated\nthat he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van\nVechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf\nturned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929). *Peter\nWhiffle* was the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the\nML.\n\nThere was a second printing of 1,000 copies in August 1932."

(*Fall 1933*)\n\nOriginally published by the Macmillan Co., 1898 (*The Turn of the\nScrew*) and 1892 (*The Lesson of the Master*). ML edition printed from\nplates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for January\n1930. *WR* 8 March 1930. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nThe ML’s original intent was to publish *The Turn of the Screw* only, to\nprint from Macmillan plates, and to pay a $1,000 advance against\nroyalties of 8 cents a copy (H. C. Latham, Macmillan Co., to Klopfer, 26\nNovember 1928). Cerf asked Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) to\nwrite an introduction, but Wright declined (“Dine” to Cerf, 25 March\n1929).\n\nFinal publication plans took shape in January 1930, when Macmillan\ngranted permission to add *The Lesson of the Master* for an additional\npayment of $100 (Latham to ML, 10 January 1930). Broun’s introduction,\ndated January 1930, makes no reference to *The Lesson of the Master*.\nThe ML also decided to reset both works. These changes delayed\npublication by a month or so. The royalty was renegotiated after both\nworks entered the public domain. In the 1960s the ML was paying\nroyalties of 2 cents a copy.\n\n*The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of the Master* ranked in the third\nquarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May\n1942–October 1943, just below *The Portrait of a Lady* (291). James’s\nsales improved significantly by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952 *The Turn of the Screw; The Lesson of\nthe Master* sold 3,734 copies, making it seventy-fourth of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.

(*Spring 1930*)\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> A bright constellation of artists, dilettantes and voluptuaries made\n> Bohemian New York a haven for the practitioners of all the deadly\n> sins. Into their midst came Easter Brandès with her operatic ambitions\n> and luminous beauty. A great Isolde, she had the morals of a soprano\n> and the heart of a pawnbroker. *Painted Veils* is the story of her\n> career as a singing harlot in a modern Babylon. It is told with the\n> irrepressible mirth and flavor of that shrewd and ever-fascinating\n> promenader among the seven arts— James Huneker. (*Spring 1936*)\n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1920. New bibliographical\nedition published by Horace Liveright, 1928. ML edition (pp. \\[5\\]–310)\nprinted from 1928 Liveright plates with pp. \\[5\\] and \\[9\\] transposed.\nPublished March 1930. *WR* 12 April 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1942.\n\nThe ML paid Liveright a $5,000 advance. *Painted Veils* was the ML’s\nbest-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises*\n(190) and Merejkowski’s *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154). It\ncontinued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty\nbest-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117,\nPublicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in\nSeptember 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML\nprintings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.\n\nShortly after *Painted Veils* was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith,\nthe editor-in-chief of Boni & Liveright, suggested a ML edition of\nHuneker’s autobiography *Steeplejack* (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930).\nCerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you\nreally think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no\nquestion that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to\nSmith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles\nScribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker\ntitles it published, such as *Essays*, selected and introduced by H. L.\nMencken (1929) or *Steeplejack*. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s\nglory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern\nLibrary (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936).\nThe ML edition of *Painted Veils* was discontinued six years later.\n\n"

(*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp.\n\\[v–vii\\], \\[1\\]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half\ntitle used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First\nprinting: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.\n\nThe ML offered Scribner’s a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents\na copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf\ninitially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf\nto Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may\nhave been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931\npublication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford\nin Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering $75 and\nindicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January\n1932).\n\nThere were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies\n(July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March\n1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling\n14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111\ncopies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf\nto Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *A Farewell to Arms* sold 12,287\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing\nit sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of *The Sun\nAlso Rises*. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML.\n\nScribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more\nvigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of\nthe Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf,\n29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *A Farewell to\nArms* was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr.,\nScribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a $3.00 hardbound\nedition in March 1953 and a $1.65 paperback in 1962.\n\n"

(*Fall 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1915. ML edition\nprinted from plates made from a new Doubleday, Doran typesetting; the\nplates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published June\n1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nCerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to *Victory*.\nIn 1928 he offered an advance of $3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a\nroyalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to\nNelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do\nappreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is\nunwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21\nDecember 1928). *Victory* was included in the Sun Dial Library published\nby Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that\nspecialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial\nLibrary in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title\nincluded in the series. *Victory* was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial\nLibrary titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a $1,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\n*Victory* sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Lord Jim* (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales\nof *Victory* totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad\nwas one of the ML’s best-selling authors. *Victory* sold 7,966 copies\nduring the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the\ntwelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. *Lord Jim* was the eighth\nbest-selling title.\n\n"

(*Spring 1937*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros.,\n1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July\n1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1958.\n\nThe ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated\ninterest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his\npersonal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself\nhave bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros.,\n5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk\nabout a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September\n1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he\nstated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in\nthe Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and\nI have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the\nauthor’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint\ncontract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a\nwarm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the\nModern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is\nreleased” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).\n\nWhen the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed\nKlopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the\nReaders Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s\npresident, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was\navailable (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and\nconvinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail\norder sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would\nlike to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the\noption to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer\nto Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty\nremained from the $750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed\nin 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but\nwithout an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the\nML could pay $250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club\nedition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).\n\nIn 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in\nadding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349)\nto the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper\ndirector of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the\nML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had\ntextbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer\nreplied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition\nfrom an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department\nwants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the\nModern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to\nRose, 25 July 1956).\n\n*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month\nperiod May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles\nin the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952.\n\n"

The statement on\nthe title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not\nstrictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation\nof “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and\nunabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the\nstories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional\nphrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I\nbelieve it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged”\n(Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML\nmade three sets of plates, two of which were sold for $950 each to\nWalter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the\nbook for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in\nSeptember 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition\nin November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap\nborrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition,\npaying the ML a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy\n(Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).\n\n*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling ML titles in\nthe regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October\n1952.\n\n"

His *Capital and Other Writings*, judiciously and\n> discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a\n> newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the\n> shelf of the Modern Library. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of *Capital*\nand Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint\nof *The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of\n“Capital,”* edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L.\nTrask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML\nedition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until\nOctober because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained.\n\n*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S.\nThe ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L.\nTrask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and\nit seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic\ntheories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is\nusually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and\n*Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.\n\nCerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was\nprominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was\ncompiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy\nencyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of\nMarx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932).\nCerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his\nname may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he\nwould cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The\nLenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent\nParts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally\nprojected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an\nintroduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a\nRussian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by\nLenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark\nmade by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something\ncomplete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this\ntheory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must\nadvance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p.\nxix).\n\nShortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and\nOther Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of\nLenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and\nedit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was\ncancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested,\nDeclined” under 1933 for more information.\n\nM. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack\nof an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*:\n“I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an\nindex. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which\nKarl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember\nyour obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not\nGroucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that\nSchuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to\nSchuster, 8 February 1933).\n\nSales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist\nManifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952\nwith sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The\nCommunist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in\nthe past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).\n\nThe ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s\n*Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854\ncopies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333\ncopies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.\n\n"

Only a few\n> books have survived. Of these, *Three Soldiers* stands pre-eminent. It\n> reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the\n> experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture\n> in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. *Three\n> Soldiers* introduced a writer who has since become a major figure\n> among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests\n> securely. (*Spring 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed\nfrom Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates\nappear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled\nfor November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1963.\n\nEight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday,\nDoran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern\nLibrary, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and\nThree Soldiers.” He asked how many copies *Three Soldiers* had sold in\nthe trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial\nLibrary (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that\nthe plates for *Three Soldiers* were too large for the ML’s format he\ncontacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s\n*Manhattan Transfer* and *The 42nd Parallel*. *Manhattan Transfer* had\nsold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for *The 42nd Parallel* (Henry\nHoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those\ntitles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin\nwith *Three Soldiers* and added *The 42nd Parallel* (307) to the ML five\nyears later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos\nPassos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.\n\nFor *Three Soldiers* the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of $1,250\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his\ncorrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know\nif I made more corrections in the *Three Soldiers* text than you can\nhandle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were\njust going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was\naway when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked\nCerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling\ncorrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were.\nThe introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was\ndoing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf,\nundated).\n\n*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from\nDoubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500\ncopies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20\nAugust 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952.\n\nHoughton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.*\n(G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality\npaperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination\nagreement in June and instructed the production department to make no\nmore printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June\n1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock\nand asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to\nbring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick\nMoseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated\nthat the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a\nyear, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley,\n22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if\n*Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was\n(Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January\n1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that\nyear.\n\n*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after\nfall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the\nend of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The\nBuddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring\n1969 after the oversight was discovered.\n\n"

(*Fall 1932*)\n\nA. W. Evans translation originally published in U.S. by John Lane Co.,\n1909; reprinted by Dodd, Mead & Co. after it acquired the American\nbranch of Lane in 1922. ML edition printed from Dodd, Mead plates made\nfrom a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively\nby the ML. Published January 1933. *WR* 4 February 1933. First printing:\n6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71; reissued 1984.\n\nThe original Lane/Dodd, Mead plates were too large for the ML’s format.\nFor its edition of France’s *Revolt of the Angels* (163), published in\n1928, the ML had made a duplicate set of Dodd, Mead plates, cutting off\nthe running heads and replacing the original page numerals in the\nheadline with smaller numerals placed close to the text. The result was\none of the worst looking books the Modern Library ever produced. Cerf\nconsidered doing the same for *Penguin Island* (Cerf to Frank Dodd, 4\nNovember 1932), but in the end Dodd, Mead reset the text for the ML. The\nresult was an attractive book of about 310 pages, nearly 50 pages\nshorter than the Lane/Dodd, Mead edition.\n\nThe ML used the A. W. Evans translation without identifying the\ntranslator. Evans’s renewal of the copyright in 1937—twenty-eight years\nafter the translation was first published—is indicated on the verso of\nthe title page of 253c, published in 1984.\n\nThe ML sold 7,321 copies by June 1936. Sales slowed in the late 1930s\n(an additional 2,973 copies were sold between July 1936 and June 1939)\nbut picked up in the 1940s. *Penguin Island* sold 4,876 copies during\nthe eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\nThe publication of *Penguin Island* brought the number of France’s works\nin the ML to five. *The Queen* *Pédauque* was discontinued at the end of\n1933; by the end of 1942 *Penguin Island* was the only title by France\nin the series.\n\n"

This anthology\n> puts forth a comprehensive group of short novels and tales, selected\n> primarily because they are representative of the main currents of\n> German literature and those great national figures—Goethe, Schiller,\n> Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Zweig and others—who made it the\n> world’s heritage. (*Fall 1934*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology. Published April 1933. *WR* 29 April 1933. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Superseded 1952 by *Great German Short Novels\nand Stories*, ed. Victor Lange (451).\n\nThomas Seltzer signed a contract in the late 1920s to edit an anthology\nof German literature for the ML (Klopfer to Pierre Loving, 24 February\n1928). Cerf indicates in the Introductory Note how he assumed\nresponsibility for the anthology:\n\nIt was entrusted originally to a gentleman who once enjoyed a\nconsiderable reputation in this town as a publisher and editor. He\nexpressed confidence in his ability to prepare the book, and a contract\nwas duly signed, so long ago, it seems to me, that goats were still\nroaming around empty lots on Park Avenue when the details were settled.\nAt long last, a manuscript appeared, though a new generation of German\nauthors had flowered in the interim. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with\nthe job. Of the ten stories that this painstaking editor had managed to\ngather in all these years, I liked only six well enough to publish, and\nexercising that prerogative which is one of the few privileges left to\nthe publisher in these harrowing days, I threw the others into the\nwastebasket, and set about compiling an anthology on my own. (p. viii)\n\nHitler came to power shortly before *Great German Short Novels and\nStories* was published. Cerf commented that all the authors in the\nvolume were “either dead, Jewish, or banished” (Cerf to Alfred A. Knopf,\n17 April 1933).\n\nWhen *Great German Short Novels and Stories* was being planned Cerf\ncontacted Knopf about including Thomas Mann’s *Death in Venice*,\noffering a fee of $200. Knopf replied that they could probably find a\nThomas Mann story if Cerf was “content to take one that hasn’t been\npublished in book form by itself” (Knopf to Cerf, 23 August 1932). Knopf\nhad published Kenneth Burke’s translation of *Death in Venice* as a\nseparate volume in 1925 and replaced it in 1930 with the H. T.\nLowe-Porter translation. In the end the ML was allowed to use the\nout-of-print Burke translation. The ML paid a $300 advance against\nroyalties of 3 cents a copy for its use.\n\n*Great German Short Novels and Stories* sold 4,450 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,857 copies during the\ntwelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it at the top of\nthe second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n"

Cerf cabled Stein in Paris about a ML edition\nof *Three* *Lives* (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 101). RH subsequently became\nStein’s regular publisher, and a warm friendship developed between Cerf\nand Stein.\n\nThe ML acquired the plates and full publishing rights to *Three Lives*,\nand Van Vechten wrote a new introduction for the ML edition. Cerf\ninformed Stein a month after publication that “the book is proving to be\na tremendous success for us. It is causing more comment than any new\nModern Library title in the past two years. The firm of R. H. Macy &\nCo., which has probably the largest book department in the world today,\nhas bought the astonishing number of 1300 copies of this little book\nsince publication day less than a month ago.

Cerf persuaded James Laughlin of\nNew Directions to add *Three Lives* to their New Classics series in\n1941. New Directions used the ML’s plates, including Van Vechten’s\nintroduction, and paid the ML a $250 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy.

The\nreprint contract expired on 1 July 1938, but Knopf agreed to an\neighteen-month extension through 1 January 1940. The ML paid a $1,200\nadvance for an additional 10,000 copies and agreed to sell any remaining\ncopies on hand within the first three months of 1940. Joseph Lesser of\nKnopf wrote, “Thus, you have 21 months in which to sell 10,000 copies\n(or more, I hope)” (Lesser to Klopfer, 17 May 1938). The first printing\nunder the extended contract was for 6,000 copies in October 1938. The ML\nreported in April 1940 that the last copies had been delivered from the\nbindery and that *Buddenbrooks* would be completely out of stock within\na few weeks (Emanuel Harper to Lesser, 5 April 1940).

Edward Newton has wisely and wittily recorded\n> his lifelong quest among books. The authority and the informality of\n> *The Amenities of Book-Collecting* made it the unanimous choice of the\n> editors of the Modern Library as the first bibliographical volume to\n> be welcomed into the series. (*Fall 1935*)\n\nOriginally published by Atlantic Monthly Press, 1918; sixth impression\npublished by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. \\[*7*\\],\n\\[*16*\\]–373) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from\nthe sixth impression, with the color frontispiece replaced by a\nblack-and-white portrait of Newton and other inserted plates in the\nAtlantic Monthly/Little, Brown edition photographically reduced and\nprinted with the text. Published December 1935. *WR* 14 December 1935.\nFirst printing: Probably 7,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1940.\n\nCerf and Klopfer tried to secure reprint rights to *The Amenities of\nBook-Collecting* when they acquired the ML, but the original edition was\nstill selling too well for Little, Brown to consider a reprint (Cerf to\nAlfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 18 August 1925; McIntyre to Cerf, 24\nAugust 1925). Ten years later Klopfer wrote to McIntyre: “I have just\nreturned from a visit to Mr. A. Edward Newton’s home in Paoli where we\nhad a grand evening talking about his projected set of Trollope. At that\ntime I suggested that it might be a good idea to do a Modern Library\nedition of The Amenities of Book Collecting. He referred the matter to\nyou and I am taking this opportunity of finding out how you feel about\nit” (Klopfer to McIntyre, 21 February 1935). McIntyre replied that he\nwould be glad to consider the possibility (McIntyre to Klopfer, 25\nFebruary 1935).\n\nThe Little, Brown plates were too large for the ML’s format. Cerf\ninitially proposed resetting the text and making new plates, and he\nwanted Little, Brown to share the cost. He offered an advance of $750\nagainst royalties of 10 cents a copy but indicated that the ML would pay\nonly 7 cents a copy until the cost of the plates was recovered, after\nwhich the plates would become the property of Little, Brown (Cerf to\nMcIntyre, 11 April 1935). McIntyre declined the offer. He didn’t think\nthat Newton should share the cost of the plates and noted, “I figure\nthat every sale we lose of the regular edition must be offset by a sale\nof at least fifty copies of your edition unless our gross profit on the\nbook is to be lessened.” He suggested photographically reducing the\npages and printing by photo-offset (McIntyre to Cerf, 12 April 1935).\n\nCerf decided that photo-offset was practicable and agreed to pay the\n$750 advance against a flat 10-cent royalty. He noted that photo-offset\n“would be more costly than the ordinary job and I am afraid the result\nmay not look as well, but nevertheless the result should be good enough\nto suit all practical purposes” (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 April 1935). The\nPolygraphic Co. of America quoted a total price of $792 for making the\nplates and printing 7,000 copies. This represented $400 for plate work,\nincluding all halftones, and $392 for press work. The cost of reprints\n(make-ready and press work) was quoted as $296 for 5,000 copies or $408\nfor 7,000 copies (Polygraphic Co. of America to Klopfer, 18 July 1935).\n\nNewton received $50 for his introduction to the ML edition. When Cerf\ninvited him to write it, he noted that such introductions “have meant\nnot only additional interest on the part of the book-buying public, but\nspecial attention from the entire reviewing fraternity. In other words,\nthe new introduction gives the critic a reason for doing a brand new\nreview of the book regardless of the fact that it is a reprint” (Cerf to\nNewton, 25 April 1935)."

Accordingly, I would esteem it a\ntremendous personal favor if you could get your foreword over to us in\nthe course of the next two weeks – that is, before the first of\nFebruary. This would enable us to manufacture the book in time to get\nall the orders that are floating about” (Cerf to Newton, 14 January\n1936). Newton submitted his introduction by 1 February, and the ML\nedition was published a few weeks before the customary publication date\nof the 25th of the month.\n\nThe Trollope Society was dedicated to making Trollope’s novels readily\naccessible in small, well-printed, inexpensive volumes. Newton hoped\nthat an acknowledgment to the Society could appear on the title page. It\nappeared instead on the copyright page: “THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER\nTOWERS are published under the patronage of <span class=\"smallcaps\">The\nTrollope Society</span>” (p. \\[iv\\]). Klopfer expressed the hope that\nthe ML edition would be the first of a Trollope Society series (Klopfer\nto Newton, 12 March 1936). But sales were disappointing and no further\nworks by Trollope were added to the series until *The Way We Live Now*\n(639) appeared in 1984.\n\n*Barchester Towers & The Warden* sold 3,196 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n"

Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nKraemer, a professor at New York University, proposed the Horace volume.\nHe asked for an advance of $100 and royalties at the standard sliding\nscale for trade books of 10 to 15 percent (Kraemer to Cerf, 20 June\n1935). Cerf agreed to the advance but indicated that the ML could only\npay royalties of 5 percent (Cerf to Kraemer, 25 June 1935). Kraemer\naccepted these terms. *The Complete Works of Horace* reprinted 29 pages\nfrom *Horace and English Verse* translated by Alexander Murison, which\nwas copyrighted by Longmans, Green & Co. in the British Empire but not\nin the United States. Cerf requested permission to use the material, but\nLongmans, Green wanted a fee of twenty guineas. This was more than Cerf\nwas prepared to pay, so the ML used the material without permission. He\ntold Longmans, Green that the ML would confine distribution to the\nUnited States and Canada. Longmans, Green asked its Canadian office to\nstop imports into Canada. T. F. Pike of the Longmans, Green Toronto\noffice wrote to Hugh Eayrs of the Macmillan Co. of Canada, the ML’s\nCanadian distributors, so that he could “advise London my duty has been\ndone” (Pike to Eayrs, 30 November 1936). Eayrs passed his letter along\nto Cerf.\n\n*The Complete Works of Horace* sold 2,730 copies during the\neighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth\nquarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 44,171 copies by spring 1958.\n\n"

ML edition\n(294a, pp. \\[*7*\\]–360) printed from offset plates photographically\nreduced from the Smith and Haas edition with page numerals “v–vi”\nremoved from contents pages; 294b–c (pp. v–360) printed letterpress from\nSmith and Haas/RH plates; 294d printed from offset plates\nphotographically reduced from the Smith and Haas edition. Published\nSeptember 1936. *WR* 26 September 1936. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1973/74. Published in Vintage Books, February 1969.\n\n*Man’s Fate* was the first Smith and Haas title added to the ML after\nCerf and Klopfer absorbed the firm in April 1936.\n\nThe Smith and Haas edition measured 8⅜ x 5¾ inches with a type page of\n6⅜ by 3⅝ inches. The plates were far too large for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch\nformat. To include *Man’s Fate* in the series the ML would either have\nto reset the text and make new letterpress plates or photograph a clean\ncopy of the Smith and Haas edition, reduce the type page\nphotographically, and print by offset lithography. The quality of offset\nlithographic printing in the 1930s was inferior to letterpress and the\ncost of each print run was higher, but photographing an existing book\nwas significantly cheaper than making a new typesetting. There were at\nleast two printings of 294a from offset plates, including a September\n1939 printing of 3,000 copies.\n\nThe introduction of the larger ML format in fall 1939 made it possible,\nwith uncomfortably narrow margins, to use the original letterpress\nplates for subsequent ML printings (294b–c). With a top margin that\naveraged about ¼ in. (6 mm), letterpress printings in the 1940s, 1950s,\nand early 1960s were not examples of fine bookmaking. The ML reverted to\noffset lithography in 1964 (294d) after the cost of offset printing\ndropped below that of letterpress. *Man’s Fate* is the only ML title to\nhave been printed initially by offset lithography, then by letterpress,\nand again by offset lithography. The type pages of 294d are\nphotographically reduced from an early Smith and Haas printing, making\nprintings of 294d superior to earlier ML printings in terms of\ncomfortable margins and freshness of the type.\n\nThe ML paid royalties of 5 cents a copy, either directly to Malraux or\nto Gallimard, the French publisher of *La Condition humaine*.\n\n*Man’s Fate* sold 3,376 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. *Man’s Hope* (G56), Malraux’s other novel in the ML, sold 2,143\ncopies during the same period. *Man’s Fate* did not rank among the 100\nbest-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period\nNovember 1951–October 1952.\n\n"

Its\nrhetorical style and point of view seemed uncomfortably dated by the\n1950s:\n\n> In this book one grasps the profound meaning of the revolutionary\n> impulse in terms of individuals. One understands here why no setbacks,\n> no defeats, no slaughters can ever kill the undying flame which is\n> burning in the hearts of men all over the world, which is spreading,\n> working its way on the surface and underground, through a thousand\n> channels, flaring up sporadically, always growing, always more\n> vigorous and irrepressible, with the force of life itself. . . .\n>\n> There are many of us today who ask of a work of art more than beauty\n> of form and substance. We are in the midst of a critical period of\n> history, a period when the basic values of civilization are being\n> threatened. We say that an artist—more than others sensitive to the\n> moods of society—cannot remain aloof and indifferent, that to justify\n> himself he must deal with matters that are important and help to\n> clarify human problems. (294a–b, pp. 3)\n>\n> Those of us who demand this can now point to *Man’s Fate* and say:\n> ‘This is what we mean!’ (294a–b, pp. 3–4).\n\nChevalier’s name figured prominently in the J. Robert Oppenheimer\nhearings in April 1954. The decision to drop the introduction (unless it\nwas made earlier) may have been in response to publicity surrounding the\nhearings.\n\n"

Today *Maurice Guest* is\n> ranked, among musical novels, with *Jean Christophe* and *Evelyn\n> Innes*, and has grown so steadily in esteem that it is surpassing\n> Henry Handel Richardson’s best-selling novel, *Ultima Thule*. (*Fall\n> 1936*)\n\nOriginally published in U.S. by P. R. Reynolds, 1908, and Duffield &\nCo., 1909, probably using printed sheets or duplicate plates of the\nEnglish edition published by William Heinemann, 1908. New\nbibliographical edition published by W. W. Norton & Co., 1930. ML\nedition (pp. \\[1\\]–566) printed from Norton plates. Published October\n1936. *WR* 31 October 1936. First (and only) printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1940.\n\nA ML edition of *Maurice Guest* was suggested by at least two people.\nThe ML’s traveler for the Middle West passed along a bookseller’s\nsuggestion for the novel (James L. Crowder to Cerf, 1 October 1934), and\nW. W. Norton appears to have suggested a ML reprint. Cerf expressed\nreservations about its sales potential: “May I ask you on what terms you\nwill be prepared to let us publish MAURICE GUEST in the Modern Library\nthis Fall? I agree with you that it is a fine book, but am a little\ndoubtful as to just how big a seller it would be” (Cerf to Walter\nNorton, W. W. Norton & Co., 2 January 1936).\n\nHenry Handel Richardson was the pen name of Ethel Florence Lindesay\nRichardson. Commins identified the author as Henrietta Richardson in the\nfirst draft of his biographical note and indicated that “Handel” had\nbeen taken from the name of the composer. Norton asked Cerf to omit the\nreference since neither Norton nor Heinemann, her English publisher, had\never made Richardson’s identity public. He also pointed out that she had\nbeen married for over thirty years to an important figure in English\nletters (the philologist John George Robertson) and was no longer Miss\nRichardson (Norton to Cerf, 28 July 1936). Commins left in the reference\nto “Miss Richardson” but omitted information about to her real name.\n\nThe ML edition was not a success. Copies of the first printing have been\nseen with the remainder mark of a star stamped on the endpaper."

Signed: Cassens.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> The foremost authorities of the world are in agreement that *The\n> Charterhouse of Parma* is one of the great works of fiction in the\n> French language. Such writers as Balzac, Nietzsche, Zola, Dowden,\n> André Gide and Lytton Strachey acclaimed it. *The Charterhouse of\n> Parma* finds a distinguished place in the Modern Library series. With\n> *The Red and the Black* (No. 157), Stendhal is now represented by his\n> two chief novels. The translation by C. K. Scott Moncrieff captures\n> the glowing spirit of this nineteenth-century masterpiece. (*Fall\n> 1936*)\n\nScott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. by Boni &\nLiveright, 1925, as vols. 1–2 of *The Works of Stendhal*. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–290; \\[*1*\\]–343) printed from B&L plates. Published January\n1937. *WR* 23 January 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued\nfall 1943.\n\nArthur Pell, president of the Liveright Publishing Corporation, had to\nsecure the approval of the Stendhal estate before he could sign the\nreprint contract for the ML edition. Lewis Galantière agreed to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition: “It will make Stendhal sell,” he assured\nCerf, “and remember that he has never sold in America” (Galantière to\nCerf, 30 October 1936). Galantière missed the deadline; *The\nCharterhouse of Parma* went to press without an introduction, and sales\nwere disappointing.\n\nTotal printings of the ML edition were as follows: 5,000 copies\n(November 1936); 1,000 copies (November 1940); 1,000 copies (March\n1941); 1,000 copies (January 1942); 1,000 copies (November 1942). Unsold\ncopies of the first printing, which were in the ML’s balloon cloth\nformat, were remaindered after the November 1940 printing, which was in\nthe larger format that the ML introduced in fall 1939. (Information\nabout Macy’s February 1941 sale of 110,000 balloon cloth volumes appears\nunder “General” in the chapter for 1939.)\n\nWartime paper shortages together with a surge in demand for reading\nmatter in general contributed to the ML’s decision to drop *The\nCharterhouse of Parma*, which continued to sell poorly in comparison to\nother titles in the series. The discontinuation of the ML edition in\nfall 1943 provoked strong protests and damaged the ML’s reputation among\nacademics and intellectuals. The debate began with an open letter by\nGeorge Mayberry in the *New Republic* (8 November 1943, p. 661):\n\n> An Open Letter\n>\n> The Modern Library, Inc.,\n>\n> New York City.\n>\n> Sirs: Reading one of your recent circulars to the trade I was deeply\n> shocked to discover that along with James Branch Cabell’s “Jurgen” and\n> John Strachey’s “The Coming Struggle for Power,” Stendhal’s “The\n> Charterhouse of Parma” was dropped from the Modern Library on August\n> 15, 1943. The demise of the first two books is hardly disturbing, if\n> no one has begrudged their respectively arch and instructive existence\n> in your series. But the passing of Stendhal’s masterpiece in\n> Scott-Moncrieff’s incomparable translation is serious enough for\n> comment.\n>\n> One assumes that from time to time the poorest-selling titles are\n> dropped from your list, and as a general procedure this can hardly be\n> quarreled with. Nor is there need to ring the obvious changes on the\n> ironies that Stendhal is surely one of the most “modern” of\n> nineteenth-century writers, that his contemporaneity was recently\n> dramatically invoked when two serious commentators on the Allied\n> invasion of Italy drew parallels between this event and the first\n> chapter of “The Charterhouse of Parma,” that Stendhal looked for no\n> public (nor did he have one) until long after his death, that he\n> somewhat tediously addressed his fiction to “the happy few,” among\n> whom the patrons of your series surely wish to be classed.\n>\n> You need not be reminded that “The Charterhouse of Parma” is one of\n> the world’s great novels, that however few copies may have been sold\n> in recent years, its popularity will hardly diminish over a period of\n> time, and that it will be read for centuries to come. Whatever\n> immediate impulse, then, impels you to drop it is the result of\n> commercial as well as esthetic shortsightedness.\n>\n> May I urge you, therefore, to reconsider your decision. For this great\n> book, in a translation that matches its greatness, to go out of print\n> will be a serious deprivation for a coming generation of readers, even\n> if a handful are now to profit (one presumes) by picking up\n> remaindered copies at Macy’s.\n>\n> <span class=\"smallcaps\">George Mayberry</span>\n\nCerf’s response ignored the cultural and literary issues raised by\nMayberry and focused on sales (“Stendhal and the Modern Library,” *New\nRepublic*, 29 November 1943, pp. 747-48):\n\n> Sir: Your issue of November 8 contains an open letter addressed to the\n> Modern Library and signed by George Mayberry, which questions our\n> announced intention of dropping Stendhal’s “The Charterhouse of Parma”\n> from the Modern Library. May I explain why this step was taken?\n>\n> The total sale of this volume in our series in 1938 was 307 copies; in\n> 1939, 636 copies; in 1940, 544 copies; in 1941, 820 copies. Last year,\n> when the sale of every title in the series was booming, ‘The\n> Charterhouse of Parma’ crept up to 1,083. Of all the 234 titles in the\n> Modern Library, this sales record is one of the worst three. Under\n> present conditions, when every sheet of paper counts, it seemed to us\n> that we had no choice in the matter but to drop such a laggard from\n> the series. It is necessary to print a book of this length in the\n> Modern Library in an edition of 5,000 copies; such a printing would\n> have lasted us in this case, under the most favorable conditions, for\n> somewhere between four and five years. \\[*This statement was not\n> strictly true. The first printing was for 5,000 copies, but the ML had\n> reprinted it, as noted above, 1,000 copies at a time*.\\]\n>\n> May I explain further that we have frequently been compelled to drop\n> titles from the Modern Library that we should have liked to have kept\n> there but that were obviously standing in the way of the healthy\n> growth of the entire series. We have had examples before of fine\n> reprint series that were damaged beyond repair by the retention of\n> obvious deadwood. Some booksellers have neither the inclination nor\n> the time to check stock carefully on each series; they see on their\n> shelves an ample stock of the titles that do not sell rapidly and\n> quite overlook the fact that they are sold out on the really popular\n> numbers. Gradually the impression grows upon them that the series is\n> losing its popularity and, one fine day, they remove the books from a\n> favorable and accessible position in the front of the store to some\n> dusty shelf in the rear. The fact that this has never happened to the\n> Modern Library, we attribute to our admittedly ruthless policy of\n> eliminating all titles that cannot hold their own after a full trial\n> period in actual sales.\n>\n> Incidentally, we’d like to point out to Mr. Mayberry that Stendhal’s\n> “The Red and the Black” is still obtainable in the Modern Library.\n> Some day I hope that public demand will warrant the relisting of “The\n> Charterhouse of Parma.”\n>\n> BENNETT A. CERF\n\nMayberry’s response appeared in square brackets following Cerf’s letter:\n\n> \\[I think Mr. Cerf’s explanation was anticipated in my original\n> letter. His “ruthless” commercial candor is a refreshing contrast to\n> the pious highmindedness of most of those engaged in the business of\n> making and selling books, but I still feel that Mr. Cerf could keep\n> “such a laggard” as “The Charterhouse of Parma” on his list without\n> seriously prejudicing the popularity or the financial prospects of the\n> Modern Library. —G.M.\\]\n\nIntellectuals were not appeased; the discontinuation of *The\nCharterhouse of Parma* became a cause célèbre. In 1945 the little\nmagazine *Pharos* published a special issue on Stendhal in which Harry\nLevin, the future Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at\nHarvard, reprinted Mayberry’s “Open Letter” and charged that “the\npublishers of The Modern Library committed the cultural outrage against\ntheir country of dropping from the Library their edition of Stendhal’s\nmasterpiece *The Charterhouse of Parma* because they thought they were\nunable to sell it as numerously as such great works of literature as\n*Life with Father* and *Rebecca*” (*Pharos*, no. 3, Winter 1945, p. 71).\n\nLevin acknowledged in his introductory note to the issue, which\nconsisted primarily of his sixty-four-page essay, “Toward Stendhal”:\n“. . . it cannot be said that he has been widely discussed in English,\nin spite of some admirable translations by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff; and in\nAmerica, with the clairvoyant exceptions of James and Huneker, Stendhal\nhas received little notice and exerted no influence” (ibid., p. 5).\n\nJames T. Farrell, writing the following year about the commercialization\nof publishing, asserted that a study of ML titles added and dropped in\nrecent years showed that its editors were “gradually watering down their\nstock” (“Will the Commercialization of Literature Destroy Good Writing?\nSome Observations on the Future of Books,” *New Directions* 9, 1946, p.\n13).\n\nWhen Jason Epstein launched Anchor Books, the first American “quality”\nor “trade” paperback series, in 1953—a decade after the fact—he staked a\nclaim to the intellectual audience by making *The Charterhouse of Parma*\nhis first title.\n\nIn 1999, fifty-six years after *The Charterhouse of Parma* was\ndiscontinued, the ML restored it to the series in a new translation by\nRichard Howard. That edition, in paperback, was in print as of 2016.\n\n"

To avoid resetting the text the ML the published *Lust for Life*\nin the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would become standard for ML books\nbeginning in fall 1939.\n\nLewis Miller, the RH sales manager, liked the larger format. He\nconsidered *Lust for Life* the most presentable book the ML had\npublished, “particularly because it is oversize, just like TEN DAYS THAT\nSHOOK THE WORLD” (Miller to James Crowder, 3 February 1939). He also\nregarded the jacket as one of the best in the series. The format and\nappearance of the ML edition were especially important since the ML did\nnot have exclusive reprint rights and shared the market with a dollar\nreprint published by Grosset & Dunlap (Miller to Rollin B. Fisk, 8\nFebruary 1939).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,269 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1\nNovember 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML titles. It\nsold 3,576 copies during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952,\nplacing it high in the second quarter of ML titles. Adjusted for 18\nmonths, 1951–52 sales exceed those for 1942–43 by fewer than 100 copies;\nthe ranking of *Lust for Life* in the third quarter of ML sales during\n1942–43 reflects the increase in demand for books of all kinds during\nthe Second World War.\n\nPocket Books, Inc., published *Lust for Life* as a 25-cent paperback in\n1945. The film version of Stone’s novel starring Kirk Douglas, released\nin 1956, probably led to an increase in sales of the ML edition, but\nsales figures for the mid-1950s are not available.\n\n"

The\nabridgment reduced the text from 635 to 285 pages.\n\nWhen the RH edition of *The War in Outline* was published Cerf wrote to\nEugene O’Neill, who had lent him an earlier book by Liddell Hart: “I was\nso deeply impressed by that book that I swore that one day we’d get\nsomething by Hart \\[*sic*\\] for Random House. This is one time anyhow\nthat a dream came true!” (Cerf to O’Neill, 21 September 1936). Cerf does\nnot appear to have realized that Liddell Hart was a compound surname.\nThe author’s forenames, Basil Henry, were omitted from the title pages\nof Random House and ML printings and also from the jacket, and *The War\nin Outline* was entered under “Hart” in ML lists and catalogues.\n\nThe ML edition sold 2,481 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing it among the thirty worst-selling titles for that period. Random\nHouse offered to sell the plates to Liddell Hart after the ML edition\nwas discontinued (Emanuel Harper to Liddell Hart, 31 October 1947).\n\n"

The printing with the spring 1949 jacket is probably the first\nfrom the reset plates. The original introduction stated, “Of Walton’s\nmother nothing is known, not even her name.” New information allowed\nKeynes to revise this passage as follows: “His mother, Anne Walton,\nsurvived her husband for thirty years, having married Humfrey Burne of\nStafford in 1598. She was buried in Stafford in May, 1623” (p. 3). A\nfootnote indicates that the source of the new information was a letter\nfrom Arthur M. Coon of Cornell University in *The Times Literary\nSupplement* (25 December 1937).\n\nThe fall 1952 printing of the jacket was the last in three colors. The\nfall 1954 jacket in two colors (black and strong green) may have been a\nresponse to rising costs of color printing or declining sales of *The*\n*Compleat Angler*. The ML edition of *The Compleat Angler* was\ndiscontinued at the end of 1957."

ML edition (pp.\n\\[*7*\\]–343) printed from Viking plates**.** Published September 1939.\n*WR* 9 September 1939. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued\n1971/72.\n\nThe ML secured exclusive reprint rights to *In Dubious Battle* shortly\nbefore the publication of *The Grapes of Wrath* in 1939 vastly enlarged\nSteinbeck’s audience. An earlier reprint had been published by Blue\nRibbon Books in October 1937, but it sold poorly and was out of print by\nNovember 1938. Lewis Miller expected the success of *The Grapes of\nWrath* to stimulate interest in all of Steinbeck’s books (Miller to\nCrowder, 11 July 1939). In a memo to the sales force he urged the\ntravelers to open their sales talks with *In Dubious Battle*:\n\n> We got the sole reprint rights before GRAPES OF WRATH leaped to\n> best-sellerdom and very lucky, too, for I am convinced it would have\n> been more advantageous to the Viking crowd to have given the book to\n> Grosset as well as to us. We would in that case have shared the market\n> and perhaps not a big share either. If Grosset had IN DUBIOUS BATTLE\n> they would get an advance of 20,000 to 25,000 copies, in my judgment.\n> We are looking for an 8,000 to 10,000 advance on the strength of the\n> fact that this brand new army of Steinbeck readers is now wide open\n> for his past work. Every bookstore you call on has sold good\n> quantities of GRAPES OF WRATH and that’s the market for IN DUBIOUS\n> BATTLE. . . . Remember that IN DUBIOUS BATTLE does not take up much\n> room and you have got to get at least a 25-stack if you expect the\n> public to see it. We want 25’s, 50’s and 100’s. If a dealer buries\n> this title on a shelf in 1’s and 2’s, we are licked before we start.\n> (RH Box 153, Sales folder)\n\nThe ML distributed a four-color display poster to bookstores that\ndescribed *In Dubious Battle* as “a long, full, satisfying novel that\ndeals with the same kind of characters and the same background as THE\nGRAPES OF WRATH” and launched a $7,500 advertising campaign that\nfeatured *In Dubious Battle* along with Steinbeck’s other ML titles,\n*Tortilla Flat* and *Of Mice and Men* (*PW*, 5 August 1939, p. 351). A\nspecial discount was offered for combination orders of all three\nSteinbeck titles: 41 percent for 50 copies, 40 + 5 percent for 100\ncopies, and 44 percent for of 250 copies. The 40 + 5 percent discount\nwas normally reserved for the ML’s biggest customers, such as\nBrentano’s, Macy’s, and Marshall Field & Co., who obtained ML books\n(list price 95 cents) for 55 cents instead of the 57 cents paid by\nbooksellers who got a straight 40 percent discount. Booksellers who\nreceived this discount were expected to promote the series aggressively.\n\n“You can see the leverage you get with such a schedule,” Miller told the\ntravelers. “You may get a dealer who can buy only 25 IN DUBIOUS BATTLE\nand you now have got a wedge to get 25 assorted out of the other two.\nAnd so on, up the scale” (RH Box 153, Sales folder). He also reminded\nthem, “In selling this title don’t overlook the point that, because the\nbook will be bound in stiff covers, it lends itself admirably to lending\nlibrary use in addition to over-the-counter sales” (Miller to Consolino,\n31 July 1939).\n\n*The Grapes of Wrath* led the 1939 best-seller list and remained one of\nthe ten best-selling fiction titles in 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp.\n127–29). Sales figures for the ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* are not\navailable for 1939 and 1940. The ML edition of *In Dubious Battle* sold\n6,028 copies during the 18-month period 1 May 1942–1 November 1943,\nplacing it in the second quarter of ML titles—but by then *The Grapes of\nWrath* itself was available in the ML. *In Dubious Battle* was not among\nthe 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month\nperiod, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n"

Broadly ironic and rich in its commentary on\n> the pretenses and follies of English society, *Joseph Andrews* is a\n> novel of manners and character, written with insight and tolerance and\n> sharp wit. It is by these two novels that Fielding is acknowledged the\n> master by whom the great school of Victorian novelists was inspired.\n> (*Spring 1954*)\n\nPublished initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.\n\nWhen *Joseph Andrews* was included on the first list of titles to be\npublished in MLCE, Stein offered Jones $75 to add a bibliography and\ninvited him to look over the introduction to see if he would like to\nmake any changes (Stein to Jones, 27 January 1950).

(*Fall 1940*)\n\nOriginally published by University of Chicago Press, 1933. ML edition\n(pp. v–\\[549\\]) printed from University of Chicago Press plates.\nPublished September 1940. *WR* 14 September 1940. First printing: 5,000\ncopies. Discontinued 1969/70.\n\n*The Short Bible* was included in the ML after Cerf and Klopfer failed\nto secure reprint rights to Smith and Goodspeed’s *The Complete Bible:\nAn American Translation* (University of Chicago Press, 1939), which they\nwanted for the Giants. Cerf had offered a $5,000 advance for *The\nComplete Bible* ($3,000 on signing and $2,000 one year after\npublication) shortly after it was published. He noted, “I honestly think\nwe could sell 50,000 copies of this book in two years’ time” (Cerf to\nDonald Bean, University of Chicago Press, 17 October 1939). When the\nUniversity of Chicago Press indicated that a reprint of *The Complete\nBible* was premature, Cerf offered a $1,000 advance against royalties of\n10 cents a copy for *The Short Bible* (Cerf to Bean, 30 November 1939).\nShortly after this communication, the University of Chicago asked Bean\nto run its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, and Rollin D. Hemens became\nActing Manager of the Press.\n\nCerf and Klopfer did not abandon their hopes of getting *The Complete\nBible*. During a visit to California Cerf discussed the situation with\nGoodspeed. He told Klopfer, “I got him steamed up about getting the\ncomplete Bible in the series and he is going to write a strong letter to\nthe Chicago University Press to emphasize this point” (Bennett Cerf\nPapers. Cerf to Klopfer, 19 December 1939). When he returned from\nCalifornia he wrote to the University of Chicago Press that he and\nGoodspeed had decided against a ML edition of *The Short Bible*. He\nreported to Goodspeed, “I have written to Mr. Hemens . . . that . . .\nyou and I had decided that it would be the intelligent thing to pass up\nthe Short Bible as far as the Modern Library is concerned and wait until\nwe can concentrate all our selling efforts on the Modern Library Giant\nedition of the *Complete Bible*. I told him that we both understand full\nwell that the time is not yet ripe for this Modern Library edition, but\nif we could have it within two years’ time, we would be quite willing to\nguarantee a sale of 50,000 copies and to make this guarantee a part of\nour contract” (Cerf to Hemens, University of Chicago Press, 27 December\n1939; Cerf to Goodspeed, 28 December 1939).\n\nLewis Miller disagreed with this decision and argued for going ahead\nwith *The Short Bible*. He pointed out that a ML edition ought to sell\nwell, that another reprint publisher was likely to pick it up if the ML\nrejected it, and that whichever firm got *The Short Bible* would have a\n“toe-hold” on *The Complete Bible*. He recommended that the ML secure\n*The Short Bible* on the understanding that it would get *The Complete\nBible* if and when it became available. He acknowledged Cerf and\nKlopfer’s concern that a ML edition of *The Short Bible* might injure\ntheir chances of getting *The Complete Bible* if it sold poorly but\nconcluded, “It’s a risk we should take” (Miller memo to Cerf, 23\nFebruary 1940).\n\nCerf reopened discussions with the University of Chicago Press three\ndays later (Cerf to Hemens, 26 February 1940). The reprint contract for\n*The Short Bible* was signed in May when Hemens visited New York. After\nsigning Cerf wrote, “I hope that when and if the time comes to discuss a\nreprint edition of the Complete Bible, the Modern Library will be given\nthe first opportunity of entering into negotiations with you for this\nedition!” (Cerf to Hemens, 15 May 1940).\n\nTwo years later Cerf offered a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10\ncents a copy for reprint rights to *The Complete Bible*. Hemens replied\nthat it would not be available for 1943 but that things might be\ndifferent the following year (Cerf to Hemens, 12 May 1942; Hemens to\nCerf, 19 June 1942). Cerf wrote again later in the year, noting that\nmany readers wanted a complete Bible. “When you are ready to let us have\nthe complete Goodspeed Bible, I am sure we will be able to do a really\nimpressive job with it” (Cerf to Hemens, 21 October 1942). *The Complete\nBible* never appeared in the ML.\n\nThe text and quotations on the front panel of the ML jacket are adapted\nand abridged from the front panel and flap of the University of Chicago\nPress jacket, but the design of the ML jacket is far more attractive and\nappealing than that of the original edition.\n\nThe ML edition of *The Short Bible* sold 6,735 copies between 1 May 1942\nand 1 November 1943, placing in the second quarter of ML titles. There\nwas a second printing of 3,000 copies in February 1941, additional\nprintings of 5,000 copies each in September 1941 and October 1942, and\nprintings of 4,000 copies in March 1944 and 7,000 copies in January\n1945. It sold 3,371 copies during the twelve month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing it 117th out of the 125 best-selling ML\ntitles.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*The Holy Bible*, illus.

He asked Little, Brown for a\ncopy after attending a party at which “Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs spent about\nan hour raving about C. S.

The ML paid Little, Brown\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. The ML edition appeared eleven years\nbefore the release of the John Huston film based on the novel.\n\nForester expressed the hope that the ML could restore the chapters\nomitted by Little, Brown (Cerf to McIntyre, 15 January 1940). In the\nforeword to the ML edition he wrote that he had been engrossed in\nwriting another book when Little, Brown indicated “they did not like the\nend of the book and had thought of a simple way of changing the end\nwithout calling for any effort from me.

Discontinued\n1970/71.\n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace a $250 advance, and Porter received $25 for\nher introduction. In later years the ML paid royalties of 10 cents a\ncopy; it is possible that the initial royalty rate was lower. Porter was\npleased that *Flowering Judas* was to be included in the series. She\nwrote Cerf: “It will be a new lease on life for Flowering Judas, and I\nhope you will not have any cause to regret reprinting it. For myself, a\nbuyer of books with very limited means, I have found the Modern Library\na God-send. I have about sixty of those little books, and mean to have\nmore.” She also discussed her introduction: “I have begun, uncertainly,\na kind of small preface. It should be short, I think, to match the book;\nauthors writing about themselves and their works are in general a little\non the dull side, anyway. But I shall do what I can” (Porter to Cerf, 8\nMay 1940).\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,234 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943.\nThere was a second printing of 2,000 copies in November 1942. Earlier\nthat year Cerf told Porter, “The Modern Library edition of the book\nsells slowly but steadily and we have no intention in the world of\nletting it drop into a void” (Cerf to Porter, 24 April 1942).\n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace decided in 1948 to launch its own hardbound reprint\nseries, Harbrace Modern Classics, the firm served notice that it was\nterminating the reprint contracts for all of its titles in the ML (S.\nSpencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, to ML, 18 May 1948). The ML had 4,400\ncopies of *Flowering Judas* in stock, and Klopfer estimated that it\nwould take twelve months for the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3\nJune 1948 and 28 June 1948). The ML edition was officially discontinued\nin fall 1950. Its number (ML 88) was reassigned to William Faulkner’s\n*Light in August* (429), which was published in the series shortly after\n*Flowering Judas* was discontinued.\n\nHarcourt, Brace subsequently decided against including *Flowering Judas*\nin Harbrace Modern Classics and allowed it back into the ML in spring\n1953. The ML commissioned a new jacket to welcome its return and\nassigned *Flowering Judas* a new number (ML 284). Some copies of the\n1946 ML printing that remained in the warehouse were sold in the spring\n1953 jacket.\n\n"

It has a touch of God in it, and\n> the devil. It has all New York in it and most of America.” The reading\n> public agreed enthusiastically with this judgment and took to its\n> heart Christopher Morley’s story of an obscure man caught in the act\n> of being human. Every reader of Morley’s national best-seller, *Kitty\n> Foyle*, as well as those who have yet to experience their first\n> acquaintance with his writings, will enjoy the glowing warmth of\n> *Human Being*. (*Fall 1940*)\n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1932; rights\nsubsequently acquired by J. B. Lippincott Co. ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*–*7*\\], ix–350) printed from Doubleday/Lippincott plates with a\ncorrection requested by Morley. Published October 1940. *WR* 12 October\n1940. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.\n\nThe suggestion to include *Human Being* in the ML came from Morley\nhimself. He wrote Cerf (31 January 1939):\n\n> Every time I get one of the Modern Library lists it gripes me a little\n> to see myself represented in there only by *Parnassus on Wheels*; a\n> worthy little book I dare say, but it seems pretty juvenile as I look\n> at it now.\n>\n> I so often say to myself, how I wish you’d think about putting in\n> *Human Being*, a novel which seems to me to stand up well in\n> retrospect and which has been out since 1932 so I have had time to get\n> a good many comments on it. I think it gives a picture of the\n> Depression period as it worked on a Caspar Milquetoast sort of person;\n> a picture which I don’t believe anyone else has given us.\n\nCerf replied, “I thoroughly agree with you that you should be\nrepresented in the Modern Library by more than PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. I\ndon’t think, however, that HUMAN BEING is the book by you that should be\nadded; I am sure there are other books on the Christopher Morley\nbacklist that would be a much better bet for a series like the Modern\nLibrary” (Cerf to Morley, 2 February 1939). A month later Cerf admitted\nthat he had never read *Human Being* and asked Morley to send him a copy\n(Cerf to Morley, 3 March 1939). After reading it he indicated that he\nstill thought that other books of Morley’s “would have a more general\ninterest than this one. . . . I may be completely cockeyed, but I think\nthat a lot of my enjoyment of HUMAN BEING came from the fact that I was\nable to identify the characters with the old Doubleday personnel!” (Cerf\nto Morley, 30 August 1939).\n\nMorley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett\nand Burke, pp. 127–29), and his publisher began to talk about reissuing\n*Human Being* in a full-priced edition. Morley indicated that he would\nprefer to see it in the ML (Morley to Cerf, 4 January 1940), and Cerf\nagreed to put it in the series. “Both Bob \\[Haas\\] and I still think it\nis a rather special sort of book, but it should make its way anyhow, and\nthe huge success of KITTY FOYLE will help it to a good start” (Cerf to\nMorley, 31 January 1940). The ML paid Lippincott a $500 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. At Morley’s request the ML edition\ncorrected “George” to “Herman” on p. 25, line 9.\n\n*Human Being* sold 2,110 copies during the eighteen-month period May\n1942–October 1943, making it the tenth worst-selling title in the ML.\nMorley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten\nworst-selling titles at this period—and he had two books in that\ncategory. *Parnassus on Wheels* (213), with sales of 1,814 copies, was\nthe second worst-selling title.\n\nThere was a second ML printing of 2,000 copies in December 1943. By\nFebruary 1944 sales of the ML edition of *Human Being* exceeded 6,000\ncopies (Cerf to Percy Loring, Lippincott, 8 February 1944).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nMorley, *Parnassus on Wheels* (1931–1954) 213"

Cerf and Klopfer quickly learned to\ndesign trade books that were potential candidates for the ML so that the\nplates would fit the ML’s format without resorting to major surgery such\nas the removal of running heads.\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,347 copies during the eighteen-month period 1 May\n1942–1 November 1943, placing it at the top of the third quarter of ML\ntitles. Sales appear to have declined after the Second World War and the\nML edition was discontinued in fall 1948. When Saroyan asked if it was\nout of print Cerf replied disingenuously that it was not out of print\nand that 3,000 copies of the ML edition remained on hand (Cerf to\nSaroyan, 5 April 1949)."

First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe anonymous nineteenth-century translation used by the ML was based on\nthe first printing of Hugo’s *Notre-Dame de Paris* (1831) and does not\ninclude three chapters that Hugo added when the book was reprinted in\nDecember 1832. The added chapters consist of Book Four, Chapter 6, and\nBook Five, Chapters 1 and 2. (Books Five through Ten in the translation\nused by the ML are Books Six through Eleven in the second printing, and\nBook Four, Chapter 4 appears in the second printing as Chapters 4 and\n5.) Hugo argued that the second printing was definitive but not\n“augmented” in the sense that it included newly written material. The\nthree added chapters were part of the original manuscript but had been\nmisplaced when the book was first printed. They surfaced in time to be\nincluded in the 1832 printing (Hugo, *Notre-Dame de Paris*, translated\nand edited by John Sturrock \\[London: Penguin Books, 2004\\], pp. 26–29).\n\nThe absence of Book Five, Chapter 2, “Ceci teura cela” (This Will Kill\nThat), is especially regrettable. Hugo argues in this chapter that the\nprinting press had supplanted architecture as the primary medium for the\npublic expression of human thought. Before printing, he writes, “during\nthe world’s first six thousand years, from the most immemorial Hindustan\npagoda to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great script of\nthe human race. And so true is this, that not only every religious\nsymbol but also every human thought has its own page and its own\nmonument in this immense book” (Penguin Books, 2004, p. 191).\n\nWhen the ML reprinted *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* in 1996 as part of\nthe “relaunch” of the series that began in 1992 it used the anonymous\nand incomplete translation that had been in the series between 1941 and\n1971.\n\n*The Hunchback of Notre Dame* sold 4,004 copies during the 18-month\nperiod 1 May 1942–1 November 1943, placing it low in the third quarter\nof ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling\ntitles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November\n1951–October 1952.

Published October 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941.\nFirst printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 31 December 1959.\n\nThe Viking Press edition led the best-seller list in 1939 with sales of\n300,000 copies (Hackett and Burke, p. 127). The ML paid Viking Press a\n$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for non-exclusive\nreprint rights. There was a ML printing of 2,000 copies in December\n1942; later printings included 4,000 copies each in May 1943 and June\n1944.\n\nThe ML edition sold 9,495 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943,\nplacing *The Grapes of Wrath* in the middle of the first quarter of ML\nand Giant titles. Sales declined to 3,964 copies during the 12-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it toward the bottom of the\nfirst quarter of titles.\n\nIn Chapter 30 (the last chapter) of Viking Press printings, the number\nof lines per page increases between the fifth printing (May 1939) and\nninth printing (September 1939). The first page of Chapter 30 (p. 593)\nof the ninth printing has one more line than early printings; lines are\nshifted forward throughout the chapter, with the result that the last\npage of text (p. 619) has only four lines—five fewer than the fifth\nprinting. The reason for the shift has not been determined. The plates\nused by the ML reflect the later configuration of Chapter 30.\n\nThe ML’s reprint contract appears to have been terminated in 1958 when\nViking Press published *The Grapes of Wrath* in its quality paperback\nseries, Compass Books.

Adapted from the jacket of the Viking Press edition\nwith a short quotation from Ralph Thompson and the words “A MODERN\nLIBRARY BOOK” replacing the name of the original publisher at the foot\nof the front panel. Hansen (p. 188) attributes the design of the ML\njacket to George Salter; the jacket illustration is a reworking of the\nBemelmans drawing on the title page.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> What this country really needs is an entertaining story of its own\n> foibles in wartime. Bemelmans’ *My War with the United States* fulfils\n> that need and provides a welcome antidote to the national jitters.

Both amiable and\n> wise, his book is a special gem of eccentric literature, and its\n> illustrations cannot fail to bring a happy chuckle to soldier and\n> civilian alike. This is the first Bemelmans book to appear in a\n> reprint edition.\n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1937. ML edition (pp. \\[3\\],\n\\[5\\]–151) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the\nViking Press edition with the title-page imprint revised. Published\nOctober 1941. *WR* 4 October 1941. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued fall 1948.\n\nThe verso of the title page contains the boilerplate statement,\n“Manufactured in the United States of America | Printed by Parkway\nPrinting Company Paper by Richard Bauer & Co. | Bound by H. Wolff”. The\nML’s regular printers, Parkway Printing, did not have an offset\ndepartment before 1955. The ML edition was printed by a company that\nspecialized in offset lithography. The ML probably submitted its\nstandard manufacturing statement to the printer, though it is possible\nthat Parkway subcontracted the job.\n\nThere are enough blank pages at the end of the volume to accommodate a\nML list, but the lists of titles at the end of other ML volumes were\nprinted from letterpress plates, which were incompatible with offset\nprinting.\n\nThe jacket also appears to have been printed by offset lithography, and\nthe inside of the first printing of the jacket is blank. Later printings\nof the jacket, including a printing that probably dates from spring\n1942, include ML lists. The ML may have photographed subsequent lists so\nthey could be included in later offset printings of the jacket.\n\nThe ML edition was published two months before the attack on Pearl\nHarbor and American entry into the Second World War. Early ML printings\nare on thicker and stiffer paper than most ML titles, probably to\nenhance the reproduction of the text and illustrations by offset\nlithography. Later printings are on noticeably thinner paper because of\nwartime paper shortages.\n\nThe ML edition sold 4,495 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of regular ML and\nGiant titles."

Published February 1942. *WR* 14 February 1942. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML edition of *Oracles of Nostradamus* was published two months\nafter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The decision to include\nNostradamus had been made before the United States entered the war. Cerf\ncommented, “We put that title in, possibly with our tongues in our\ncheeks, because people seem to be interested in predictions of a strange\ncharacter” (“Of Men and Books: Critic John C. Frederick, guest Bennett\nCerf, in a Radio Conversation over the Columbia Broadcasting System,”\n*Northwestern University on the Air* 2, no. 16 \\[16 January1943\\], p.\n4).\n\nWhen the United States declared war on Japan on 8 December 1941 and\nrecognized a state of war with Germany and Italy three days later, the\nfuture looked dark and the outcome of the war was uncertain. *The\nOracles of Nostradamus* became one of the Modern Library’s best-selling\ntitles. It sold 16,043 copies during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943. Only five ML titles—Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage*\n(199) and Dostoyevsky’s *Crime and Punishment* (228) in the regular\nseries, and *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* (G37), James T.\nFarrell’s *Studs Lonigan* (G39), and *The Short Stories of Ernest\nHemingway* (G59) in the Giants—sold more copies during this period.\n\n*The Oracles of Nostradamus* did not rank among the 100 best-selling\nregular ML titles in 1951/52.\n\n"

First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued\n1 January 1949.\n\nThe first Harcourt, Brace printing, published in September 1922, exists\nin two states, with the second state containing two corrections on p. 49\n(“Lyte” instead of “Purdy” in line 3, “any” instead of “my” in line 5).\nThree more corrections were made in the second printing, one correction\n(“for” instead of “against” on p. 392, line 1) was made in the third\nprinting, and eleven more corrections were made in the fourth printing,\nmaking the fourth printing “the most authoritative version of the work”\n(John Hersey, “Note on the Texts,” *Main Street & Babbitt* \\[New York:\nLibrary of America, 1992\\], p. 883).\n\nHarcourt, Brace anticipated strong sales and made a duplicate set of\nplates, probably before *Babbitt* was published. The duplicate plates\nincorporate the corrections in the second state of the first printing\nbut not those in the second, third, or fourth printings, which were made\nbetween October and November 1922. The duplicate plates or shells, which\nappear to have been made in July 1922, were held in reserve.\n\nWhen the ML negotiated reprint rights in 1941, Harcourt, Brace melted\nthe original plates, which had become worn, and provided the duplicate\nplates to the ML for its printings. ML printings, as well as later\nprintings in Harbrace Modern Classics (1950) and other reprint editions,\nrevert to the text of the second state of the first printing, and do not\ninclude the corrections made in the second, third, and fourth printings\n(Matthew J. Bruccoli, “Textual Variants in Sinclair Lewis’s *Babbitt*,”\n*Studies in Bibliography* 11 (1958): 263–68; available online at\n[http://www.bsuva.org](http://www.bsuva.org/). For the next fifty years\nall American printings—including the paperback edition in Signet\nClassics (1961)—appear to have omitted the corrections made to the text\nin the third, fourth, and fifth Harcourt, Brace printings. The\ncorrections were restored in the Library of America edition of *Main\nStreet & Babbitt* (1992) but many subsequent editions, such as the\nBantam paperback published in 1998, continued to be set from flawed\nearlier printings.\n\nTo secure *Babbitt* Cerf agreed to a three-year reprint contract, after\nwhich Harcourt, Brace had the right to cancel the contracts for the ML\neditions of both *Babbitt* and *Arrowsmith*, with the cancellations to\nbe effective on the same date. He told Harcourt, “I shall be curious to\nsee just how the Pocket Book \\[mass market paperback\\] edition of\nARROWSMITH affects both your edition and ours of that book!” (Cerf to\nHastings Harcourt, 31 July 1941).\n\nLewis became a RH author in 1939 when he followed his editor Harry Maule\nfrom Doubleday to Random House. *Arrowsmith* (243) had been in the\nModern Library since 1933, but Lewis wanted to have more of his books in\nthe series. Maule conveyed the good news that *Babbitt* would be added\nto the series: “Bennett and I thought you might be interested to know\nthat, through some complicated horse-trading, he has finally gotten\nBABBITT for the Modern Library. I don’t begin to understand the\nconvolutions by which he was able to do this, but he thinks this time it\nwill stick” (Maule to Lewis, 1 August 1941). Lewis was “extremely glad”\n(Lewis to Maule, 12 August 1941). *Dodsworth* (348) became his third\ntitle in the series in 1947.\n\nThe ML edition of *Babbitt* sold 5,807 copies during the 18-month period\nMay 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. There was a second printing of 2,000 copies in October 1942 and\na third printing of 2,000 copies in March 1943.\n\nWhen Harcourt, Brace launched its own reprint series, Harbrace Modern\nClassics, for the burgeoning college market in 1948, it served notice\nthat it was terminating the ML’s reprint contracts for all of Lewis’s\ntitles in the ML (*Arrowsmith*, *Babbitt* and *Dodsworth*) as well as\nfive other Harcourt, Brace titles by E. M. Forster, Katherine Anne\nPorter, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf (S. Spencer Scott, Harcourt,\nBrace, to ML, 18 May 1948). At that time the ML had 4,000 copies of\n*Babbitt* in stock; Klopfer estimated that it would take eight months\nfor the books to sell out (Klopfer to Scott, 3 June 1948; 28 June 1948).\nThe Harbrace Modern Classics edition of *Babbitt*, printed from the same\nplates used by the ML, was published in 1950. *Dodsworth* was reprieved;\nit was never included in Harbrace Modern Classics and the Modern Library\nedition remained in print until 1970.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nLewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933–1952) *254*\n\nLewis, *Dodsworth* (1947–1970) *400*\n\nLewis, *Cass Timberlane* (1957–1970) *499*"

(*Fall 1954*)\n\nOriginally published by Harper & Bros., 1940, with an introduction by\nDorothy Canfield Fisher. The Harper plates were available to the ML but\nwere too large for its format; the ML edition was printed from plates\nmade from a new typesetting. Published March 1942. *WR* 14 March 1942.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.\n\nCerf expressed interest in a ML edition shortly after *Native Son* was\npublished (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper’s, 11 April 1940). Hoyns promised\nto talk with the ML when it was time to consider a reprint but noted\nthat Grosset & Dunlap “probably can make a lot more money for Mr. Wright\nand for us than you can” (Hoyns to Cerf, 12 April 1940). Cerf replied\nthat it should be possible for both Grosset & Dunlap and the ML to do\nthe book. “Oddly enough, we don’t seem to get in each other’s way on\nthese reprint editions, and we have already worked together on new\ntitles for our various lines on more than one occasion, to the benefit\nof everybody concerned” (Cerf to Hoyns, 17 April 1940).\n\nThe following year Cerf wrote to Wright hoping to secure his support for\na ML edition. He indicated that he wanted to publish *Native Son* in\nspring 1942 and invited Wright to write an introduction if a ML edition\ncould be arranged (Cerf to Wright, 12 August 1941). Wright did not reply\nand Cerf wrote again on 3 September 1941. Wright does not appear to have\nreplied to this letter either. In the end the ML reprinted the Fisher\nintroduction from the Harper edition.\n\n*Native Son* sold 7,046 copies during the during the 18-month period May\n1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant\ntitles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular\nML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.\n\nHarper’s informed the ML in 1956 that its College Department wanted to\ninclude *Native Son* and Richard Hughes’s *High Wind in Jamaica* (239)\nin Harper Modern Classics, a clothbound series aimed at the textbook\nmarket (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper’s, to Klopfer, 20 July 1956).\nHarper’s was willing to allow both titles to remain in the ML, but\nKlopfer decided to drop them when the stock on hand was exhausted.\n“They’re not strong enough titles to hang on in competition with your\nown cloth-bound edition” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956)."

The best and most characteristic of Santayana’s writings\n> in prose and verse are assembled in this volume of 650 pages. Irwin\n> Edman, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, who is\n> responsible for the selection, contributes a brilliant Introductory\n> Essay. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published with Edman’s introductory essay by Charles\nScribner’s Sons, 1936. ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Publication announced for November 1942 but published in\nSeptember. *WR* 26 September 1942. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1952.\n\nCerf expressed interest in *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939, but\nScribner’s does not appear to have been ready to authorize an\ninexpensive reprint (Whitney Darrow to Cerf, 17 July 1939). Three years\nlater the ML paid Scribner’s an advance of $1,000 against royalties of 5\ncents a copy on the first 20,000 copies, after which royalties increased\nto 10 cents a copy. Plates of the Scribner edition were not available\nand in any case would have been too large for the ML’s format.\nScribner’s accepted the lower initial royalty to enable the ML to\nrecover the cost of resetting the type and making new plates. Edman\nedited the original edition for a flat fee and received no additional\npayment for the ML edition.\n\nThe suggestion for a ML edition of Santayana’s collected works came\ninitially in 1926 from Horace M. Kallen, who had edited *The Philosophy\nof William James* (119) for the ML the previous year. Kallen, a former\nstudent of Santayana’s, wrote from Rome that he had showed the James\nvolume to Santayana and suggested that the ML needed a similar\ncollection of Santayana’s philosophy. Santayana did not want to edit the\nvolume himself and urged Kallen to do it. Kallen told Cerf that he was\ninterested but would want a royalty plus a fee of not less than $250\n(Kallen to Cerf, 5 November 1926). Cerf told him to go ahead, then wrote\nthree months later to cancel the project, noting that he wanted the book\nbut was afraid that Scribner’s would not give the necessary permissions\n(Cerf to Kallen, 29 November 1926; Cerf to Kallen, 3 March 1927). That\nsummer Cerf indicated to Joseph Ratner, who had written on Santayana’s\nbehalf to inquire about progress on the project, that the collection was\nout of the question for the time being because of the large number of\npermissions that would have to be secured from Scribner’s. “We are\nconvinced that just as soon as we approached them on the subject they\nwould turn us down and proceed on such an anthology on their own . . .”\n(Ratner to Cerf, 8 June 1927; Cerf to Ratner, 11 August 1927).\nScribner’s published *The Philosophy of Santayana* in 1939.\n\nThe ML edition sold 7,405 copies by 1 November 1943. Scribner’s\npublished a new and greatly enlarged edition of *The Philosophy of\nSantayana* in 1953 and may have terminated the ML’s reprint contract in\nanticipation of the appearance of that edition.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nSantayana, *Sense of Beauty* (1955–1970) 478"

Published February 1943. *WR* 13 March 1943.\nFirst printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nThe Cooper translation of Boethius was originally published in Temple\nClassics by J. M. Dent, 1902. The anonymous translation of *The\nImitation of Christ* is that published in Everyman’s Library (J. M.\nDent, 1910). The text of *Religio Medici* probably derives from *The\nReligio Medici and Other Writings of Sir Thomas Browne* (Everyman’s\nLibrary, 1906).\n\nEdman received a $500 advance against royalties of 5 cents a copy for\nhis work on the volume. He was asked to write an introduction of 5,000\nwords that would include discussions of the three individual works. When\nit arrived three months after the deadline Commins wrote, “It’s the kind\nof introduction that makes me very proud of the work we are doing in the\nModern Library” (Commins to Edman, 3 December 1942).\n\nCerf and Commins consulted several authorities about translations of\nBoetheus and Thomas à Kempis. Richard McKeon of the University of\nChicago indicated that the translation of Boethius in the Loeb Classical\nLibrary was poor and expressed the hope that the ML was preparing a new\none (McKeon to Commins, 19 August 1942).\n\nJ. William Eckenrode of the Newman Book Shop in Westminster, Maryland,\nnoted that *Religio Medici* was on the Index and warned that its\ninclusion would ruin the sale of the book to Catholics. He also advised\nusing a different translation of *The Imitation of Christ*. “If you\ncould use a Catholic translation of the Imitation in preference to a\nProtestant translation, without calling attention to this fact, this\nwould make the book doubly valuable to Catholics, but if you put Religio\nMedici in, it would just ruin the sale” (Eckenrode to Cerf, 2 November\n1942).\n\nEckenrode’s letter caused some concern and Commins asked Edman for his\nopinion. He replied, “We need not be too concerned—in my judgment—by the\nfact that Religio Medici is on the Catholic Index. There aren’t enough\nliterate Catholics anyway to concern Random House from the sales point\nof view, and so I think we are quite safe in taking a high moral\nviewpoint on the matter, and being independent” (Commins Papers. Edman\nto Commins, 11 November 1942).\n\nThe ML edition sold 5,111 copies by 1 November 1943."

It mixes the great with the trivial; long\nstretches of it seem only pedantic categorizing; other stretches seem\nrather obvious.

(*Spring 1944*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for November 1943. *WR* 30 October 1943. First printing: Not\nascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML Shakespeare took its text and glossary from *The Complete Works\nof Shakespeare*, edited by W. J. Craig (Oxford University Press, 1904),\nand its notes from the Temple Shakespeare, edited by Israel Gollancz (20\nvols., J. M. Dent, 1894–96). The Craig edition was still in print and\nOxford University Press asked the ML not to divulge the source of its\ntext publicly. In response to a professor who inquired about the text,\nCommins indicated, “This was done with full permission, but with the\nrequest that the text be presented without acknowledgement” (Commins to\nWilliam T. Hastings, Brown University, 17 December 1943).\n\nAt least one reviewer regretted the lack of acknowledgment. In the *New\nRepublic*, Theodore Spencer described the ML Shakespeare as “a very\nagreeable job of printing, on which the publishers are to be\ncongratulated. But they give no indication as to which text is used, an\nomission as reprehensible as it is exasperating. The reader has a right\nto know whose judgment he is being asked to follow, and the editor who\nhas done the work should receive acknowledgement” (Theodore Spencer,\n“Editions of Shakespeare,” *New Republic*, 10 January 1944, p. 57).\n\nThe drab brown jackets used on the first printing were differentiated\ngraphically only by the color of the lettering (green for the\n*Tragedies*, red for the *Comedies*, blue for the *Histories and\nPoems*). These colors appear to have been added at the request of Lewis\nMiller, the RH sales manager, and it was his dissatisfaction with the\noriginal jackets that led to the newly designed jackets used on the\nsecond printing. Miller sent the following memo to Ray Freiman (25\nAugust 1943), the Random House art director, when jacket A was in the\nproof stage:\n\n> The basic merchandising defect in the three present Shakespeare\n> jackets is that they all look alike, and for that reason will present\n> a monotonous front both on the shelf and in the window. It is\n> altogether too important a property to be so handicapped.\n>\n> Ultimately we will have to do a real job of surgery on these jackets,\n> so that while they are held together by a common thread of\n> recognition, through design and layout, each will nevertheless have\n> its own identity because of color treatment. I understand completely\n> that time forbids any serious alteration for the present, but I\n> continue to want to see fresh proofs with the word Shakespeare in\n> other colors.\n>\n> I believe you are reasonably satisfied with the present jackets, but I\n> ain’t chum, for the reasons advanced, so let’s compromise, a la Sam\n> Goldwyn, and give me what I want.\n\nThe length of the three Shakespeare volumes made it difficult for the ML\nto keep them in stock during and immediately following the Second World\nWar. Paper rationing during the war limited the number of printings; the\nfall 1943 and spring 1944 printings, which were distinguished by\ndifferent jackets, and a third printing in spring 1945 appear to be the\nonly printings during the war.\n\nThe war in Europe ended in May 1945 and Japan surrendered in August, but\nit took time for the printing and publishing industries to recover from\nwartime shortages. Ray Freiman reported in spring 1946 that it would be\nthree or four months before the Shakespeare volumes could be reprinted\nbecause of paper shortages and the printing time required (Freiman to\nMr. Siegel, Maurice Inman, Inc., 26 April 1946). Postwar inflation,\nwhich made it impossible to sell the three Shakespeare volumes at 95\ncents and break even, was an additional complication.\n\nThe Shakespeare volumes were not reprinted until fall 1947. At that time\neach volume was divided into two, making the ML Shakespeare a six-volume\nset.\n\n"

It will be years\nuntil we can get these back in one volume and come out even and, in the\nmeantime, we’ll have the Shakespeare back in print in these two-volume\nsets.” (Bennett Cerf Papers. Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947). The\nprinting order for 16,600 sets of the 6-volume Shakespeare was dated 21\nMay 1947; the binding order was dated 23 July.\n\nEach volume was sold individually. An unfortunate result of splitting\nthe Shakespeare volumes was that the notes and glossary were in the\nsecond volume of each two-volume set.\n\n"

All three Shakespeare volumes were projected for inclusion in\nthe Illustrated ML but only the *Tragedies* (IML 14) and *Comedies* (IML\n15) were published.\n\nThe numbering of the six Shakespeare volumes changed to ML 2–7 in fall\n1959 because new business machines acquired by Random House could not\nhandle number-letter combinations. The shift made it necessary to assign\nnew numbers to four other ML titles. *The Modern Library Dictionary*\n(509) moved from ML 4 to 1, Douglas’s *South Wind* (114) from ML 5 to\n304, Ibsen’s *Six Plays* (490) from ML 6 to 305, and *Wisdom of\nConfucius* (312) from ML 7 to 306.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nShakespeare, *The Tragedies of Shakespeare* (Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Comedies of Shakespeare* (1 vol., 1943–1947; 2 vols.\n1947–1971; Illustrated ML, 1944–1945)\n\nShakespeare, *The Histories and Poems of Shakespeare* (1 vol.,\n1943–1947; 2 vols., 1947–1971)"

Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with\nthe plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that\ncomposition and plates would cost at least $500 and suggested reducing\nthe advance from $1,000 to $750, to which Cerf agreed. Edman received\n$250 for the Foreword (Commins to Edman, 2 December 1943).\n\n"

Publication announced for spring\n1944. *WR* 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1 January 1957.\n\nWatkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1929) included short stories, selections\nfrom novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and\nautobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories,\nessays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection\nrepresents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s\nNegro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the\nNegro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind\nabout his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp.\nxi–xii).\n\nFor poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have\nbeen published in this field: *Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro\nPoetry for Young Readers*, by Arna Bontemps; *Book of American Negro\nPoetry*, by James Weldon Johnson; *Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse\nby Negro Poets*, by Countee Cullen; *Negro Voices, An Anthology of\nContemporary Verse*, by Beatrice M. Murphy; *Negro Poets and Their\nPoems*, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from\nnovels he recommends “that the following novels be read: *Their Eyes\nWere Watching God*, by Zora N. Hurston; *Home to Harlem*, by Claude\nMcKay; *The Blacker the Berry*, by Wallace Thurman; *My Lives and How I\nLost Them*, by Countee Cullen; *These Low Gro*unds, by W. E. Turpin;\n*Blood on the Forge*, by William Attaway; *Black Thunder*, by Arna\nBontemps; *Native Son*, by Richard Wright, and *The White Face*, by Carl\nR. Offord” (p. xiii).\n\nKeneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to *The Negro\nCaravan*, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee\n(Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that *The Negro Caravan* has been\nhighly influential in establishing a canon of African-American\nliterature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that\nendures. He does not believe the same is true for the *Anthology of\nAmerican Negro Literature* (1944).

This\nsummer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume.\nThe first step in this process, duly recognized by the International\nOrder of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb\nthrough all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of\nnumerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library\narchives” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 28 August 1943, p. 17).\n\nEleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the\nanthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a\nflat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4\ncents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy.\n\n*Famous Ghost Stories* (IML 17) was also published in the Illustrated\nModern Library (1946) with illustrations by Hugo Steiner-Prag and\nWilliam Sharp.\n\n"

The original plates were too\nlarge for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to\ndate. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly\nlegitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November\n1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive\nrewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the\noriginal text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense\nhere and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the\naddition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii).\n\nThe original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies. There were six\nprintings of the ML edition with total sales of just over 27,000 copies\n(Commins to Harold R. Isaacs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 4\nSeptember 1956).\n\n"

ML edition printed from plates made from a new\ntypesetting. Published summer 1945 (publication originally announced for\nfall 1944 and then for spring 1945). *WR* 4 August 1945. First printing:\nNot ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nJames D. Hart, the author of the Foreword, had suggested a ML edition of\n*Two Years before the Mast* in 1935 and indicated that it would have a\nsteady sale to schools and colleges (Hart to Cerf, 19 February 1935).\nLater that year Cerf offered Hart $75 to write an introduction to the\nGrabhorn Press edition with the understanding that the introduction\ncould also be used in due course in a ML edition (Cerf to Hart, 12\nNovember 1935). Hart also advised Edwin and Robert Grabhorn about the\nbest edition to use as a copy-text when setting their edition.\n\nHart stated in his introduction to the Grabhorn edition, “The text for\nthis edition is the last corrected by Dana during his life, and to it is\nadded the chapter of reminiscences he wrote ‘twenty-four years after.’\nTo this have been added the concluding chapter of the first edition,\nomitted by Dana in his revisions, but interesting as showing the\noriginal purpose of his account” (p. \\[xiv\\]). The second sentence is\naltered in ML ed. as follows: “To this have been added the preface and\nepilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but\ninteresting as showing the original purpose of his account” (p.\n\\[xiv\\]). The preface appears in both the Grabhorn and ML editions; the\nepilogue (titled “Concluding Memorandum” in the Grabhorn edition)\nappears on pp. 413–23 of the ML edition as part of “Twenty-four Years\nAfter.” The concluding chapter referred to in Hart’s introduction to the\nGrabhorn edition is omitted from 381a. The ML edition also omitted the\npenultimate paragraph of Dana’s preface which referred to the concluding\nchapter: “In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided\nincorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the\nevents as they occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I\nshall respectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have\nbeen suggested to me by subsequent reflection” (Grabhorn ed., p. 4).\n\nThe film of *Two Years before the Mast* starring Alan Ladd was released\nby Paramount Pictures in April 1945. It is possible that publication of\nthe ML edition was postponed to coincide with the release of the film.\n\nThe last paragraph of Hart’s foreword in 381a reads as follows:\n\n> The text for this edition is the last corrected by Dana during his\n> life and to it is added the chapter of reminiscences he wrote\n> “twenty-four years after.” To this have been added the preface and the\n> epilogue of the first edition, omitted by Dana in his revisions, but\n> interesting as showing the original purpose of his account. (p. xiv)\n\n*Two Years before the Mast* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in\nthe regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n"

Koestler and Hardy escaped Paris\nseparately in 1940 shortly before the German occupation, and Hardy, once\nshe was safely in Britain, arranged for the publication of *Darkness at\nNoon* with the British firm Macmillan (Wikipedia; accessed 17 August\n2013).\n\nCerf initially wanted to publish *Darkness at Noon* in the ML in fall\n1942. When he approached the American branch of Macmillan he noted, “I\nthink it is a very fine book and just the sort of thing that we can do\nwell with in our series” (Cerf to George Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 12\nJanuary 1942). Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for\nfall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on\nthe grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our\nrelations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam,\nMacmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML\nedition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of\n10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942).\n\n*Darkness at Noon* was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club\nfor June 1941. When the ML edition was published nearly five years\nlater, the ML jacket stated “*The Book-of-the-Month Club Selection*”; in\nthe early 1950s the wording was changed to “*A Book-of-the-Month Club\nSelection*”.\n\n*Darkness at Noon* sold 5,257 copies during the twelve-month period,\nNovember 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and\nGiant titles."

Signed:\nVA \\[Valenti Angelo\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Of the new generation of novelists, risen to prominence during the\n> Second World War, no one stands higher than John Hersey. In *A Bell\n> for Adano* he has given the first fictional, and so far the most\n> eloquent, American interpretation of the struggle of democracy against\n> fascism. He saw that struggle in terms of men under pressure, in all\n> their simple humanity and their weakness and strength, and portrayed\n> it with moving fidelity. In a brilliant new Foreword, especially\n> written for this Modern Library edition, John Hersey re-asserts his\n> faith in the men who can secure a decent future for the world.\n> (*Spring 1946*)\n\nOriginally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1944. ML edition (pp.\n\\[1\\]–269) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1946. *WR* 27\nApril 1946. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.\n\nThe ML initially paid Knopf a flat royalty which was probably 10 cents a\ncopy. The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the retail price in\n1947 when the ML increased its list price to $1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf,\nInc., 9 June 1947). The ML did not have exclusive reprint rights. A\nPocket Books paperback priced at 25 cents appeared in May 1945.\n\nHersey’s new foreword was written for the ML edition. It appeared in\nplace of his foreword to the original edition and reflected a postwar\nrather than wartime perspective. The foreword begins:\n\n> For the early editions of this book, I wrote a foreword which began:\n> “Major Victor Joppolo, U.S.A., was a good man. You will see that. It\n> is the whole reason why I want you to know his story.”\n>\n> On second thought, and now that the war is over, the optimistic talent\n> of Joppolo was not the whole reason I wanted to put down the things in\n> this novel. I wrote the book in angry haste—in three weeks of\n> September, 1943—and I chose a far better than average Allied Military\n> Government officer, Joppolo, as its protagonist, and a worse than\n> average regular Army officer, Marvin, as its antagonist, because I was\n> just back from the fronts and I was all hot and bothered about two\n> things.\n>\n> One of them was the fact, which became evident at about H Hour plus\n> one minute of the Sicilian invasion, that our long-standing dedication\n> to the job of winning the war first and worrying about the problems of\n> peace afterward was not going to work out very well. . . .\n>\n> The other thing about which I was disturbed when I wrote the novel was\n> a concern shared by most of the citizens who served in our\n> citizen-Army—namely, that the country should never forget that the\n> military system is repugnant to the democratic system, that no matter\n> how essential armed strength may continue to be, we should never\n> forget that the Army habit of life is one which can corrupt weak men,\n> when they achieve the authority of rank, and can waste strong ones,\n> when they do not. There is something un-democratic about the absolute\n> control which a small symbol, a star, an eagle, a leaf or a bar, worn\n> on the shoulder or pinned to the collar, gives one man over every\n> other man who wears a lesser symbol, no matter what their relative\n> talents may be. . . . (ML ed., pp. v–vii).\n\nCommins considered Hersey’s foreword “perhaps the best introduction ever\nto appear in a Modern Library book” (Commins to Hersey, 29 November\n1945). When Ian Ballantine inquired about including the ML foreword in\nthe Bantam paperback edition, Cerf replied that the ML would not\n“consider allowing it to be reprinted in the Bantam edition or anywhere\nelse” (Cerf to Ballantine, 30 April 1946). Printings of the Knopf\nedition continued to use the original foreword, as did other reprint\neditions, including the Vintage Books paperback (1988), published more\nthan thirty years after the ML edition was discontinued.\n\nCopies of the spring 1947 printing (based on the ML list at the end of\nthe volume) exist with standard ML endpapers but a non-ML binding and\njacket. The binding cloth is light gray with the title and author\nstamped in black on the spine; the jacket is light gray with author and\ntitle printed in blue on the front panel and backstrip. No publisher is\nindicated, but the descriptive text on the jacket flap is the same used\non ML jackets, and the book is printed from the same typesetting as\nregular ML printings. These copies may have been produced by the ML for\nthe use of an unidentified organization or group; details are unknown.\n\nThe ML edition did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the\nregular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952."

(*Spring 1946*)\n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication\nannounced for February 1946. *WR* 6 July 1946. First printing: Probably\n10,000 copies.\n\nCerf contacted Harper & Bros. in 1944 about including *The Adventures\nand Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* in the ML. He offered a $2,500 advance\nagainst royalties of 5 cents a copy on the first 20,000 copies and 10\ncents a copy thereafter. The ML expected to order a new typesetting and\nmake new plates, and Cerf indicated that the low initial royalty was a\nway of sharing those costs (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27\nApril 1944). Harper & Bros. did not object to a ML edition but referred\nCerf to A. P. Watt, the literary agency representing the Conan Doyle\nEstate (Hoyns to Cerf, 28 April 1944). Watt had a reputation for being\ndifficult to deal with and initially offered the ML reprint rights for a\nperiod of eighteen months. Cerf regarded that as an impossible\nlimitation and began to think about putting together a volume of Holmes\nstories in the public domain (Cerf to Hoyns, 29 August 1944).\n\nKlopfer, who was stationed in Britain with the U.S. Air Force, met with\nWatt in London the following January. At this point the ML had dropped\nits proposal for a reduced initial royalty and Watt was asking for a\nthree-year limitation clause. Cerf asked Klopfer to try to persuade Watt\nto drop the limitation clause altogether on the grounds that the ML\nwould be investing in new plates (Bennett Cerf Papers. Cerf to Klopfer,\n4 January 1945; Klopfer to Cerf, 26 January 1945; Cerf’s letter is\nincluded in Cerf and Klopfer, *Dear Donald, Dear Bennett*, pp. 195–98).\nHe also wrote Watt directly, repeating the ML’s offer of a $2,500\nadvance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He noted that the ML was\nconsidering putting *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* into\nthe Illustrated ML as well as the regular series, and he indicated that,\nalthough the reprint contract would have to be for more than three years\nand he preferred an indefinite contract, he was willing to compromise at\nten years (Cerf to Watt, 19 January 1945). Later that spring Watt agreed\nto a standard reprint contract that was subject to renewal after five\nyears.\n\nVincent Starrett declined an invitation to write an introduction to the\nML edition. “It isn’t worth thinking about at the fee suggested, and I\nwould rather—in any case—not be associated with an unedited reprint of\nthe American editions of the ADVENTURES and MEMOIRS, which are pretty\ncorrupt” (Starrett to Commins, 23 August 1945). The ML edition was\npublished without an introduction. The ML planned to go to press with a\nfirst printing of 10,000 copies.\n\nThe ML edition sold 3,724 copies during the twelve-month period November\n1951–October 1952, placing *The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock\nHolmes* high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\n"

Discontinued spring 1963.\n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in\n1940 (Cerf to Holt & Co., 12 February 1940). Nearly five years later\nRobert Linscott, who had moved from Holt to Random House earlier in the\nyear, approached Holt about a ML edition of Frost’s poems. He indicated\nthat the selection of poems would be made by the ML and offered a $1,000\nadvance against royalties of 5 cents a copy until the plates were paid\nfor and 10 cents a copy thereafter. He also offered Frost $100 to write\nan introduction (Linscott to William M. Sloan, Holt, 13 November 1944).\nIt took nearly a year for Frost to agree to the project, though the\ndelay was apparently not due to objections on his part. When Sloan\nconveyed Holt’s approval he specified that the volume was not to include\nevery poem that Frost had written. He also indicated that selections of\nFrost’s poetry might be published by the Limited Editions Club and\nPocket Books (Sloan to Linscott, 5 September 1945). *The Pocket Book of\nRobert Frost’s Poems* was published in 1946 and *The Complete Poems of\nRobert Frost* (Limited Editions Club) appeared in 1950. The Modern\nLibrary contract, signed 21 September 1945, provided for a $1,500\nadvance with a sliding royalty rate as originally proposed. The contract\nwas for a period of five years and indefinitely thereafter unless\nterminated by Holt with six months’ written notice.\n\nLinscott wanted to include all but twenty-six of the poems in *The\nCollected Poems of Robert Frost* (Holt, 1939) and *A Witness Tree*\n(Holt, 1942), which had won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Linscott\nto Sloan, 7 November 1945). Frost objected to this proposal. He decided\nthat he wanted to approve the selection and proposed omitting forty-four\nof the poems on Linscott’s list and adding several that Linscott had\nleft out. Sloan wrote in December: “After the usual delays incident to\nMr. Frost’s states of mind and peregrinations, he has sent me down by\nway of Kay Morrison not a statement as to the outline you sent us, but\ninstead what he describes as a positive list” (Sloan to Linscott, 13\nDecember 1945). Linscott mourned especially for eight of the forty-four\npoems that Frost proposed to omit: “The Tuft of Flowers,” “The\nMountain,” “Home Burial,” “The Road Not Taken,” “An Old Man’s Winter\nNight,” “The Grindstone,” “The Pauper Witch of Grafton,” and “A Blue\nRibbon at Amesbury” (Linscott to Sloan, 21 December 1945). After talking\nwith Frost, Linscott was able to come to an understanding about the\ncontents of the ML edition. Seven of the eight poems were restored; only\n“The Pauper Witch of Grafton” did not appear in the ML collection.\nLinscott agreed to pay Frost $250 for an introduction of 4 to 5 pages\n(Linscott to Sloan, 23 January 1946). The introduction, titled “The\nConstant Symbol,” was also published in *Atlantic Monthly* (October\n1946, pp. 50–52) shortly before the appearance of the ML edition. Frost\nappended a new poem, “To the Right Person,” to the introduction.\n\n*The Poems of Robert Frost* sold 5,618 copies during the twelve-month\nperiod November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the middle of the first\nquarter of ML and Giant titles.\n\nNo details about the discontinuation of the ML edition have been\nascertained. The reprint contract was probably terminated by Holt,\nRinehart & Winston, and the ML edition ceased to be available early in\n1963."

(*Spring 1963*)\n\n*The Sound and the Fury* originally published by Jonathan Cape and\nHarrison Smith, 1929; *As I Lay Dying* originally published by Jonathan\nCape and Harrison Smith, 1930. ML edition printed from plates made from\na new typesetting. Published November 1946. *WR* 7 December 1946. First\nprinting: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1966; superseded by\nseparate ML editions of *The Sound and the Fury* (1966) and *As I Lay\nDying* (1967).\n\nFaulkner’s *Sanctuary* (233), published in the ML in 1932, was the only\nFaulkner title in the series until the addition of *The Sound and the\nFury & As I Lay Dying* fourteen years later. Faulkner had become a\nRandom House author in 1936 when Random House acquired Harrison Smith\nand Robert Haas, the successor to Cape and Smith. The acquisition gave\nRandom House publishing rights to *The Sound and the Fury* (1929), *As I\nLay Dying* (1930), *Sanctuary* (1931), *Light in August* (1932), and\n*Pylon* (1935). Despite disappointing sales and lack of widespread\ncritical recognition, Random House continued to publish Faulkner’s\nsubsequent works, including *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936), *The\nUnvanquished* (1938), *The Wild Palms* (1939), *The Hamlet* (1940), and\n*Go Down, Moses* (1942). The firm controlled rights to all of Faulkner’s\nnovels except *Soldier’s Pay* (Boni & Liveright, 1926), *Mosquitoes*\n(Boni & Liveright, 1927) and *Sartoris* (Harcourt, Brace, 1928), but it\ntook ten years after Faulkner became a Random House author before Cerf\nand Klopfer considered adding additional Faulkner titles to the ML.\n\nFaulkner’s fortunes changed in 1946, when Viking Press published *The\nPortable Faulkner*, edited by Malcolm Cowley, and the ML published *The\nSound and the Fury* & *As I Lay Dying* in a single volume. The two\nvolumes contributed significantly to the growing recognition of\nFaulkner’s stature in the United States.\n\nEvelyn Harter, who had been head of production at Harrison Smith and\nRobert Haas, stated in a 1978 interview that Cerf and Klopfer had been\ninterested in publishing a ML edition of *The Sound and the Fury* or *As\nI Lay Dying* in the early 1930s but took *Sanctuary* instead because\nplates had not been made for either of the earlier Faulkner titles\n(Harter, p. 7). When those titles were originally published in 1929 and\n1930 it was cheaper to keep type standing against the possibility of a\nsecond printing than to make plates—and plates were available for\n*Sanctuary*.\n\nLinscott told Cowley late in 1945 that the ML was considering a reprint\nof *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* (Linscott to Cowley, 31\nDecember 1945). Cowley replied that he did not consider *As I Lay Dying*\nto be one of Faulkner’s better novels and that he ranked it “way, way\nbelow” *Light in August*. He also didn’t like the idea of printing the\ntwo works in one volume and indicated that he would prefer to see *The\nSound and the Fury* and *Light in August* reprinted separately. He\ncontinued:\n\n> Several years ago, Faulkner sent Bennett Cerf his only copy of “The\n> Sound and the Fury.” He had underlined it in several shades of ink, he\n> tells me, to explain the different time levels in Benjy’s monologue. I\n> don’t think that’s such a good idea either. \\[In its list for fall and\n> winter 1933/34, Random House announced a signed 500-copy limited\n> edition of *The Sound and the Fur*y with the text in three colors and\n> a new introduction by Faulkner, but the volume never appeared.\\] But\n> for the Viking Portable, Faulkner did a genealogy of the Compson\n> family as an appendix, and it really clears up the doubtful points in\n> TSATF. Why not wait a year, then reissue TSATF with that appendix?\n> (Cowley to Linscott, 9 January 1946).\n\nCowley wrote Linscott again a month later. Faulkner had informed Cowley\nthat the ML planned to go ahead with its volume and wanted Faulkner to\nwrite an introduction and also wanted to use the appendix, “1699–1945\nThe Compsons” that Faulkner had written for *The Portable Faulkner*.\nCowley indicated that he didn’t anticipate any difficulty in securing\npermission from Viking Press to use the appendix. He went on:\n\n> Another, auctorial, difficulty does exist, however, and I’m writing\n> Faulkner about it. He hasn’t any copy of “The Sound and the Fury,”\n> having sent his one personal copy to Random House some years ago, he\n> says—and therefore he wrote the appendix from his memory of the novel.\n> His memory was faulty at two or three points, so that the appendix has\n> some inconsistencies with the novel that any reader would remark if\n> they were printed in the same volume (they won’t remark it in the\n> Viking Portable, however, since I used only 12,000 words of the\n> novel). I’m going to lend him my copy of TSATF and tell him that he\n> has to do some rewriting. But that’s only a temporary loan. You guys\n> at Random House will have to get him a copy of the book somehow—\n> either dig up the one he sent to Random House several years ago, or\n> else advertise in Publisher’s Weekly (and be lucky to get an answer,\n> because TSATF isn’t findable even in the second-hand bookstores), or\n> else hijack a copy from some friend.\n>\n> I hope he said that he won’t write an introduction. He’s no good at\n> writing introductions, to judge from the little piece he did for the\n> Modern Library edition of “Sanctuary.” That piece hurt him with the\n> critics, because they hate to find they had praised a book which the\n> author himself says was only written for money. (Zamatterafack\n> \\[*sic*\\], Faulkner first wrote it for money, then rewrote it\n> carefully, something one only discovered from reading his introduction\n> more attentively.) A lot of people (not me) would be glad to write a\n> short introduction to the book you are planning to publish. I mention\n> among other names: Conrad Aiken (maybe the best for the job, if he’s\n> not on bad terms with Random on account of the Ezra Pound business\n> \\[see G68\\]); Kay Boyle (a Faulkner enthusiast); Ernest Hemingway\n> (though an introduction by him might be in dubious taste—but he has a\n> lot to say about Faulkner, mostly on the credit side); and my own\n> choice for the job, to whom you would probably say No—Jean-Paul\n> Sartre, whose reputation here is going to spread, who acknowledges\n> Faulkner as his master, and who is the best critic, except Malraux,\n> perhaps, now writing in any language. . . .\n>\n> I’m still dubious about the book you are planning as the best way to\n> start Faulkner back into general circulation. The dubiety comes from\n> questions in my own mind about “As I Lay Dying,” which, disagreeing\n> with Faulkner, I haven’t ever regarded as one of his best novels. Too\n> much shifting about from one stream of consciousness to another. Not\n> enough contrast with TSATF, both being stream-of-consciousness novels.\n> I’d much prefer, let us say, “The Wild Palms,” to give a better\n> picture of Faulkner’s range. “The Wild Palms” is a short novel too,\n> under 80,000 words. Also, I think it’s a great pity that you are\n> planning to issue the book next fall. Viking is putting a good deal of\n> money into the Faulkner Portable—doing a very careful job on\n> it—letting it run to 750 pages, as against the 600 they usually allot\n> to a living author—printing a new map of Yoknapatawpha County as an\n> end paper \\[paperback reprints of the Viking Portable used the map as\n> a frontispiece\\]—and if the book gets reviews (as I hope it will) and\n> shows any sign of selling, and <u>if</u> Viking is sure of an\n> unobstructed year of sales, they might make a good advertising\n> appropriation too, as they did for the Hemingway—and <u>then</u> the\n> way would really be prepared for a reissue of Faulkner’s other books\n> beginning in the spring of 1947. This business of relaunching him with\n> the public requires cooperation rather than rivalry.\n>\n> I’m anxious for you to see the job I did on the book \\[*The Portable\n> Faulkner*\\]. It looks good to me now, and I hope the critics will\n> agree with me (Cowley to Linscott, 12 February 1948 \\[i.e., 1946\\];\n> underlining in original).\n\nLinscott replied:\n\n> I look forward to reading the appendix to THE SOUND AND THE FURY, not\n> only for its own sake, but so that I can understand why Faulkner wants\n> it printed at the front of the book instead of at the end. . . .\n>\n> I don’t think I agree with you on the introduction. Of course there is\n> a chance that Faulkner won’t do a good job, but, nevertheless, I think\n> it would be interesting to have his own account of how he happened to\n> write the books. Anyway, since we have already asked him and since he\n> has agreed, I don’t see how we could draw back.\n>\n> Neither do I agree on the subject of timing. I am sure the Portable\n> will help the sale of our volume, but I am equally sure that ours will\n> help the Portable. In other words, anyone reading either will be more\n> likely to want to read the other.\n>\n> On the other hand, you come close to convincing me in re AS I LAY\n> DYING. However, I do think it is a lot better novel as a whole than\n> THE WILD PALMS, with lovely crazy passages of poetry in it (Linscott\n> to Cowley, 15 February 1946).\n\nIn the end Faulkner did not write an introduction to the ML edition. The\nML printed his Appendix from *The Portable Faulkner* with minor\nrevisions, placing it at the beginning of *The Sound and the Fury*,\nreferring to it on the title page as “a new appendix as a foreword by\nthe author” and numbering it as pages 3–22. The 1946 ML edition was\nsuperseded in 1966 by a separately published ML edition of *The Sound\nand the Fury* (593), which prints the Appendix at the end of the volume\n(pp. 403–27). The Library of America edition of Faulkner’s first four\nnovels (*Soldiers’ Pay*, *Mosquitoes*, *Flags in the Dust*, and *The\nSound and the Fury*), published in 2006, also prints the appendix\n“Compson: 1699–1945” at the end of *The Sound and the Fury* (pp.\n1127–41).\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* sold 10,640 copies during the\ntwelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952, making it the seventh\nbest-selling title in the ML as a whole and the fifth best-selling title\nin the regular ML. It was the ML’s best selling work by an American\nwriter and the second best-selling twentieth century work, behind\nMaugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930). Eight ML titles had sales of more\nthan 10,000 copies at this period:\n\n> Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* (1930) 11,563\n>\n> Aquinas, *Introduction to Saint Thomas Aquinas* (1948) 11,129\n>\n> Aristotle, *Introduction to Aristotle* (1947) 11,114\n>\n> Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (Giant, 1931) 11,111\n>\n> Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (1932) 10,943\n>\n> Freud, *Basic Writings* (Giant, 1938) 10,669\n>\n> Faulkner, *Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (1946) 10,640\n>\n> Plato, *Works of Plato* (1930) 10,302\n\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was almost the ML’s sixth\nbest-selling title. *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* outsold the\nFaulkner volume by twenty-nine copies.\n\nFaulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, three years\nafter the publication of *The Portable Faulkner* and the ML edition of\n*The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying*."

Page numerals (vii–viii) were added to the\nreset table of contents. Publication announced for January 1947. *WR* 10\nMay 1947. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\nReprinted (pp. \\[v\\]–xiv, 3–300) in Vintage Books, May 1973, using\noffset lithographic plates photographically reduced from the ML edition,\nwith title, half title, and fly title reverting to *Crazy Like a Fox*.\n\nThe ML paid Perelman royalties of 10 cents a copy, double the rate\nspecified for a ML reprint in the Random House contract (Perelman to\nCerf, 22 September 1946). Perelman wrote a new introduction for the ML\nedition under the name “Sidney Namlerep” and sent four additional\npieces: “Physician, Steel Thyself,” “Pale Hands I Loathe,” “Insert Flap\n‘A’ and Throw Away,” and “Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer.” He hoped that\nthe additional pieces could be inserted within the text rather than\nadded at the end but recognized that that might not be possible since\n*Crazy Like a Fox* plates were being used. He also asked to change the\ndedication from “For Laura and Abby Laura” (his wife and daughter) to\n“To Robert C. Benchley” (Perelman to Klopfer, 2 December 1946). The\ndedication in the Random House edition was printed on the verso of the\ntitle page; the dedication to Benchley in the Modern Library edition\nappeared on a leaf of its own.\n\nPerelman suggested McKnight Kauffer as the jacket designer for the ML\nedition. Five years earlier, after meeting with Saxe Commins in\nconnection with his forthcoming book *The Dream Department* (Random\nHouse, 1943), he commented, “On the way out after leaving you, I looked\nat some of McKnight Kauffer’s jackets for Modern Library titles. He’s\nwonderful; I really would love to have him do a jacket for the book if\nit could be arranged” (Perelman to Commins, “Tuesday” \\[6 October\n1942\\]). Kauffer designed the jackets for *The Dream Department* and the\nRandom House trade edition of *Crazy Like a Fox* as well as the jacket\nfor the ML edition.\n\nPerelman also emphasized that it was important to proofread *Crazy Like\na Fox* carefully, and he asked for several changes in the text, of which\nthe most notable was changing “total recall” to “O’Hara’s disease” (p.\n53). Other changes included changing “rif ling” to “riffling” (p. 47),\n“jack boots” to “jackboots” (p. 88), and “compound fracture” to\n“greenstick fracture” (p. 184).\n\nNegotiations concerning the publication of *The Best of S. J. Perelman*\nbetween Cerf and Perelman’s agent, Alan Collins of Curtis Brown, Ltd.,\nwere not harmonious. Prior to publication Cerf wrote Collins: “I would\nlike to state here very clearly that we will carry out our contract for\nthe Perelman anthology in the Modern Library and that, thereafter, we\nhave not the faintest interest in future writings by Mr. Perelman” (Cerf\nto Collins, 18 November 1946).\n\nRandom House published five books by Perelman between 1937 and 1946. His\nnext book was published by Reynal & Hitchcock; thereafter he settled\ninto a long-term publishing relationship with Simon & Schuster."

Signed: RIKI.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> To bring within the compass of a Modern Library volume the essence of\n> Aristotle’s thought is an achievement of which the editors are\n> pardonably proud.

The interpretive introductions by Richard\n> McKeon are helpful guides through the ever-new world of Aristotle’s\n> ideas. (*Spring 1947*)\n\n*Jacket A2:* As jacket A1 with the designer’s name omitted. (*Fall\n1961*) *Note:* There are two versions of the jacket, one with the\ndesigner’s name RIKI on the deep orange yellow panel, the other without\nthe designer’s name. The earliest noted without the designer’s name\ndates from 1957. Some later printings of the jacket include the\ndesigner’s name, others omit it.\n\nOriginal ML collection drawn from *The Basic Works of Aristotle*, ed.\nRichard McKeon (Random House, 1941). All of the translations were\noriginally published by Oxford University Press. Publication announced\nfor January 1947. *WR* 12 April 1947. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1971/72.\n\nMcKeon edited the *Basic Works of Aristotle* without a contract and was\nunhappy with the financial arrangements he was offered when it was\ncompleted. He had undertaken the collection hoping that it could be\npublished as a ML Giant and was prepared to accept a flat fee of $500 if\nit was published in an inexpensive format suitable for classroom use. “I\nmade it abundantly clear, in conversation,” he wrote later, “that in the\nevent that a larger price was to be charged for the volume, I would\nconsent to do it only on the basis of a continuing royalty payment”\n(McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947). He was informed after he submitted the\nmanuscript that it could not be published as a Giant, and Cerf rejected\nthe royalty rate he suggested (5 percent on the first 3,500 copies\nrising to 12½ percent on sales over 10,000 copies). McKeon eventually\nagreed to an arrangement that limited his earnings to $1,250 (McKeon to\nCommins, ibid.).\n\nWhen Cerf invited him to compile a shorter collection of Aristotle’s\nwritings for the ML, McKeon insisted on a contract before beginning\nwork. He wrote Cerf, “If you had asked me to do the small Aristotle\nbefore the months of battling with Saxe \\[Commins\\] about the larger\nAristotle, I should probably have told you it couldn’t be done. After\nthat experience, I am sure it could be. Your proposition interests me,\ntherefore, but since I am a pure scholar dedicated to the truth, the\nonly thing that interests me is, naturally, money. I am sure it would\nseem sordid to a poet like you, but I would be able to think more\nconcretely and rapidly about the ‘Aristotle for Children’ which you\npropose if you could translate those glittering promises of untold\nannual wealth into concrete terms” (McKeon to Cerf, 1 September 1945).\nThe terms of the contract have not been ascertained, but McKeon\ndescribed the royalty he received on sales of *Introduction to\nAristotle* as “meager” (McKeon to Commins, 3 June 1947).\n\n*Introduction to Aristotle* established itself as a textbook and became\none of the ML’s best-selling titles. During the twelve-month period from\nNovember 1951–October 1952 it sold 11,114 copies, making it the ML’s\nthird best-selling title and one of eight titles (including Giants) with\nannual sales exceeding 10,000 copies.\n\nWhen the ML edition was declared out of print McKeon sought a reversion\nof rights so that *Introduction to Aristotle* could be published by the\nUniversity of Chicago Press. Random House agreed to his request,\noverlooking the fact that the collection was still in print in the\npaperbound series Modern Library College Editions. Klopfer admitted,\n“Nobody thought of the Modern Library College Edition until we had\ncommitted ourselves. . . . There wouldn’t have been a chance of\nreverting any rights to you if we hadn’t overlooked the MLCE” (Klopfer\nto Morris Philipson, University of Chicago Press, 2 October 1972). The\nreversion was limited to hardcover rights.\n\nThe University of Chicago Press published its edition of *Introduction\nto Aristotle* in 1973. Described as a “second edition, revised and\nenlarged,” it included a new general introduction and new introductions\nto each work. In addition to the contents of the ML edition, it included\n*De Partibus Animalium* (On the Parts of Animals), Book I, Chapter 1,\nand *Rhetorica* (Rhetoric), Book I, Chapters 1–4 and Book II, Chapters\n18–22. The format was 3/16 inch taller than the 7½ inch format the ML\nwas then using. The volume was perfect bound rather than sewn, and it\nwas bound in thin paper-covered boards—technically a hardcover under the\nterms of the contract, but for practical purposes as close as possible\nto a paperback.\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nAristotle, *Politics* (1943– ) 362\n\nAristotle, *Rhetoric; Poetics* (1954– ) 469"

The contract for the ML edition of Howard Fast’s *The\nUnvanquished* (379), which appeared in fall 1945, was signed at the same\ntime.

In 1957 Little, Brown noted\nthat the retail price of ML books had increased since 1947 and inquired\nwhether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown,\n17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12\ncents a copy.\n\n"

First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.\n\nMontaigne’s *Essays* had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first\nin the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford\nUniversity Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation,\nand the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was\nexhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to\nthink about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates\nas editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright\nprotection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and\nquite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947).\nHe then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern\nLibrary Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged.\nThe archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced\nit with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United\nStates. Because there was some question of British rights, we\nvoluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search\nof a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only\navailable ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four\nvolumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and\ncomparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29\nSeptember 1947).\n\nBates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century\ntranslation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the\npublic domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or\nreadability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the\nHazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at\nleast a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The\ncontract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely\nto Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you\ndeem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the\noriginal and to give the best possible modern rendering.”\n\nBates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt\ntranslation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the\nEditor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised\nit, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to\nthe accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to\nmodernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the\ntranslation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text\nstand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do\nconsiderable revising of the translation” (p. \\[vii\\]). Bates did not\nconsider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement\n“completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of\nthe title page be omitted.\n\nThe manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have\nbeen delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his\neditorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.\n\nBates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included\nthe essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion\nof sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain\nin language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one\nof the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and\nquotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed.\nIf you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to\nCommins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in\nfact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or,\nif included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).\n\n"

Projections for MLCE were subsequently\ncut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not\ninclude the publication of this book in the College Editions within the\nnear future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College\nEditions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year\nas we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be\nincorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to\nBates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.\n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously\nbad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML\nconsider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s\ntranslation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal,\nLetters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably\nthe definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3\nNovember 1958).

The ML’s typesetting was made\nfrom a copy of the Liveright edition provided by Hackett in which he\nindicated corrections (Secretary to Arthur Pell to Klopfer, 17 March\n1949). The $2,000 cost of the new plates was paid by the ML. The plates\nbecame the property of Liveright, and their cost was charged against\nroyalties. In effect the ML paid a $3,000 advance. Liveright contributed\nnothing up front toward the cost of the plates, and no further royalties\nwere due to either Liveright or Hackett until sales of the ML edition\npassed 30,000 copies. Hackett received $750 from Liveright when the ML\nedition was published and nothing thereafter.\n\nArthur Pell, who had gained control of Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1930\nlived up to his reputation as one of the less savory figures in American\npublishing. Hackett was unaware that he was paying for the plates out of\nhis own pocket and indicated that he would never have agreed to the\n$2,000 being charged against royalties. Pell told Hackett in 1954 that\nthe ML edition had sold 4,000 copies; when Hackett inquired at Random\nHouse he discovered the total was 8,000. Hiram Haydn informed Hackett in\nDecember 1958 that sales of the ML edition had reached 15,668 copies,\nleaving unearned royalties of $1,433.20.

Commins approved the idea. In the end a 16-page\nselection from the Introduction to *Critique of Pure Reason* was\nincluded. The ML published an abridged edition of *Critique of Pure\nReason* in 1958 (506).\n\nFriedrich wrote Commins that he thought that *The Philosophy of Kant*\nwas a misleading title since large parts of the *Critique* were not\nincluded. He suggested calling the book *Introduction to Kant* or\n*Kant’s Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy* (Friedrich to Commins,\n20 July 1949). Commins wanted to keep the original title, which had\nalready been announced. He argued that *The Philosophy of Kant* did not\nmisrepresent the book and fit well with other books in the series, but\nhe offered to use Friedrich’s suggestion as a subtitle (Commins to\nFriedrich, 25 July 1949).\n\nWhen he returned the proofs Friedrich told Commins he was “the nicest\neditor-publisher I have ever had to deal with” (Friedrich to Commins, 12\nOctober 1949; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 4, Princeton University Library).\n\nSales totaled 6,000 copies by November 1950.\n\n"

All of the drawings except one for the binding were\nto be printed in two colors, terra cotta and black (Freiman to Reiss, 21\nJanuary 1947). The composition order was placed in May, shortly before\nescalating production costs forced the suspension of the Illustrated\nModern Library.

The Random House editor Harry E. Maule then suggested Raymond\nChandler or Howard Haycraft as editor of the revised edition (Maule memo\nto Cerf, 23 September 1946).\n\nHaycraft retained six stories from the 1928 edition and replaced eight.\nIn his introduction he noted, “The most striking single development in\ndetective fiction during the 1920’s and 1930’s was unquestionably the\ngrowth of the American hardboiled school, best typified by the widely\nimitated novels of Dashiell Hammett. Unfortunately, no Hammett selection\nwas available for the present volume, and none of his disciples has\nexcelled sufficiently in the short story. The signs are not wanting that\nthe hardboiled mode has by now passed its prime as a separate and\ndistinct form” (p. xii).\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\n*Fourteen Great Detective Stories*, ed.

Dreams, according to his theory,\n> represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through\n> them inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to\n> interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche has\n> opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in\n> the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the\n> world of dreams, Sigmund Freud has created a transformation in our\n> generation’s thinking. *The Interpretation of Dreams* is here offered,\n> complete and unabridged, in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who\n> for almost forty years had been the translator and standard-bearer of\n> Freudian theories in America.

The Giant includes the following Editor’s Note:\n\n> As the first chapter of this work is nothing but an introduction to\n> the book proper, it was deemed best for the purposes of this\n> collection of Freud’s basic writings to omit most of it and to give\n> only those parts that are in any way pertinent to the themes under\n> later consideration. For it is of no particular interest or value to\n> the general reader to know everything held by the ancients and moderns\n> concerning the phenomena of dreams, up to the appearance of the first\n> German edition of this work in 1900. (p. 185)\n\nThe Editor’s Note is followed by three paragraphs headed, “*The author\nsummarizes these views as follows.*” The regular ML edition omits both\nthe Editor’s Note and this heading. The three summary paragraphs of the\nregular ML edition begin in the middle of p. 5 with no indication that\nanything has been omitted. In most editions of *The Interpretation of\nDreams* the first chapter occupies about 95 pages. In the regular ML\ntext it occupies five pages.\n\n"

First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued\n1970/71.\n\nCerf first tried to include *Kim* in the ML in 1931, perhaps as a\nreplacement for Kipling’s *Three Soldiers* (3) which had been\ndiscontinued several weeks earlier, but Doubleday, Doran was not ready\nto grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17 February 1931). He\nasked again the following year (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December\n1932) with the same result. At that point he appears to have given up.\nThe idea of including a book by Kipling resurfaced in 1949; a week later\nhe decided it should be *Kim* (Cerf to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 9\nNovember 1949 and 15 November 1949). This time Doubleday was willing to\ngrant reprint rights.\n\nThe ML paid Doubleday royalties of 10 cents a copy.\n\n"

First ML printing: Not ascertained.\n\nPublished spring 1951 in MLCE and the regular ML. Briggs received a flat\nfee of $250 to prepare a Keats collection for MLCE (Stein to Briggs, 28\nJune 1950). In June 1951 Stein indicated that a decision had been made\nto include the volume in the regular ML as well. “When the contract was\noriginally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition . . . we\ncould not foresee the astronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of\nknowing the sales possibilities of each title in the series. In order to\nbring about some sort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy\nof sales, we have had to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern\nLibrary series, hoping thereby to retrieve a part of our investment”\n(Stein to Briggs, 28 June 1951). Stein sent Briggs an additional payment\nof $100 in recognition of the publication of *The Complete Poetry and\nSelected Prose of John Keats* in the regular ML.\n\nThe volume was printed from offset plates at a time when most ML titles\nwere printed letterpress. Freiman was disappointed with the quality of\nthe printing. When the first set of MLCE sheets arrived he told the ML’s\nprinter that the quality was “very bad. I would not feel so sad about\nthis were it not for the fact that these are printed from a new set of\nplates. Further, I have been impressed with the fine quality of printing\nthe Rinehart editions enjoy” (Freiman to Richard Simon, Parkway\nPrinting, 10 May 1951). MLCE had been created to compete with Rinehart\nEditions in the burgeoning college market.\n\nThe text of the poems “is substantially that of the first editions. A\nnumber of emendations have been made as a result of collating later\neditions. . . . Some silent changes in punctuation, etc., have been made\nin the interest of greater clarity. The text of Keats’s letters . . . is\nreprinted by permission of Oxford University Press from Maurice Buxton\nForman’s *The Letters of John Keats*” (p. xxxv)."

First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1970/71.\n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular\nML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted that\n*Four Famous Greek Plays* (178) would have to be completely revised. He\ntold Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the\nModern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart\nEdition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In\naddition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more\nspecifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we\nprepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based\nupon the Lifetime Library \\[Random House\\] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK\nDRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give\nthe College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted that\n*Seven Famous Greek Plays* would differ from the Rinehart anthology in\nthe following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have\nEuripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally\ndesirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’\nLysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I\nthink for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do\nnot.”\n\nStein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library\nedition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he\nindicated that the use of these translations would depend on the\npermission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit\nthe ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions\nthat prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the\ngeneral introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein\nconcluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book\navailable for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of\nJuly 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1\nFebruary 1950).\n\nOates received a flat fee of $200 for his general introduction to Greek\ntragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a\nflat fee of $100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the\nintroduction to *The Frogs*. Permission fees included $100 each for\nAldington’s translation of *Alcestis* and Murray’s translation of *The\nFrogs*; More’s translation of *Prometheus Bound* appears to have\nrequired a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional $100\nwhen *Seven Famous Greek Plays* was added to the regular ML (Commins to\nOates, 28 June 1951).\n\n"

Published fall 1951. *WR* 29 December 1951. First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\n*Six Modern American Plays* was originally intended for Modern Library\nCollege Editions but was published in the regular ML instead and added\nlater to MLCE. Halline was offered a flat fee $150 for selecting the\nplays and writing the introduction (Stein to Halline, 10 July 1950).\nHalline, Cerf and Stein collaborated in selecting the plays. Halline\nbegan by suggesting Anderson’s *Winterset*, Kaufman and Hart’s *The Man\nWho Came to Dinner*, O’Neill’s *Mourning Becomes Electra*, Robert\nSherwood’s *There Shall Be No Night*, Philip Barry’s *Hotel Universe*,\nand Sidney Howard’s *Yellow Jack*. Stein forwarded the list to Cerf, who\nrejected *Hotel Universe* and *Yellow Jack* and indicated his preferred\nfor O’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* and Sherwood’s *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*.\n\nStein then wrote to Halline (22 September 1950) proposing Hellman’s\n*Little Foxes*. He also told Halline that he wanted a play by a new\ndramatist. As examples he listed Tennessee Williams’s *Glass Menagerie*\nor *A Streetcar Named Desire*, Arthur Miller’s *Death of a Salesman*, or\nHeggen and Logan’s *Mister Roberts;* his own preference, he indicated,\nwas Williams. Halline approved *The Emperor Jones*, *Abe Lincoln in\nIllinois* and *The Glass Menagerie* (Halline to Stein, 28 September\n1950). Stein then presented Cerf with the tentative lineup: *The Emperor\nJones*, *Winterset*, *The Man Who Came to Dinner*, *The Little Foxes*,\n*The Glass Menagerie*, and *Abe Lincoln in Illinois*. Sherwood’s play\nwas dropped when Scribner’s refused reprint permission. *Death of a\nSalesman* was the next choice, but Viking Press wanted a higher royalty\nthan the ML was prepared to pay. *Mister Roberts* was finally selected,\nin part because Random House controlled the rights. The ML paid\nroyalties of 2 cents per play for the ML edition and intended to pay\nhalf a cent per play for the Modern Library College Edition.\n\nIn the end no editor was named and Halline was credited as author of the\nintroduction only.\n\nStein informed Halline in June 1951 that the ML had decided to bring out\nthe anthology in the regular ML rather than MLCE. He noted later, “The\ncosts of the book are prohibitive as far as a Modern Library College\nEdition is concerned, although I hope we will in time be able to find\nsome way of putting it into the paper-bound series” (Stein to Halline,\n25 June 1951; Stein to Halline, 24 July 1951). *Six Modern American\nPlays* was added to MLCE in the mid-1960s.\n\nO’Neill’s *Emperor Jones* is reprinted in the version originally\npublished by Boni and Liveright in 1921. For more information see\nO’Neill, *The Emperor Jones; The Straw* (1928: 157).\n\n"

Kazin declined but\nexpressed interest in *Charterhouse of Parma*; Stein indicated that if\nStendhal’s novel were added to MLCE the introduction would be reserved\nfor him (Stein to Kazin, 21 July 1950). He then asked Jacques Barzun,\nincreasing the fee to $200. Barzun declined on the grounds that he was\nnot equipped to do Howells justice (Stein to Barzun, 4 August 1950;\nBarzun to Stein, 9 August 1950). Stein succeeded on his third attempt.\nClark received $200 for the introduction (Stein to Clark, 14 August\n1950).\n\nThe official publication date as indicated in review copies was 25\nSeptember 1951.

He then offered Stauffer $250 to prepare the\nMLCE collection (Stein to Stauffer, 4 August 1950).\n\nCommins told Stauffer before the book was published, “When the contract\nwas originally made with you for the Modern Library College Edition of\nSELECTED POETRY AND PROSE OF COLERIDGE, we could not foresee the\nastronomical rise in costs nor had we any way of knowing the sales\npossibilities of each title in the series. In order to bring about some\nsort of balance between our outlay and the expectancy of sales, we have\nhad to incorporate your volume in the regular Modern Library series,\nhoping thereby to retrieve part of our investment” (Stein to Stauffer,\n28 June 1951). Stauffer received an additional $100 when the regular ML\nedition appeared.\n\nThe poetry was set from *The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor\nColeridge*, ed. E. T. Coleridge (Clarendon Press, 1912). *Biographia\nLiteraria*, included in its entirety, was set from the edition of J.\nShawcross (Clarendon Press, 1907). Coleridge’s critical essays, “Romeo\nand Juliet” and “Hamlet, 1813,” were set from *Shakespearean Criticism*,\ned. T. M. Raysor (Harvard University Press, 1930). The remaining prose\nwas set from Coleridge’s *Complete Works*, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (7 vols.,\nHarper & Bros., 1853). MLCE printings acknowledged the Clarendon Press;\nthe acknowledgement did not appear in the regular ML edition, which\nconcerned Stein (RH box 783)."

That estimate of his seventeenth-century contemporary has been\n> reaffirmed by critics and discerning readers today. The man whose life\n> ranged almost incredibly from a dissolute youth to the deanship of St.\n> Paul’s Cathedral left for posterity love poems, satires and sermons\n> which still reflect Donne’s vigor, intensity and the extraordinarily\n> wide range of his interests. This new edition, with an Introduction by\n> Charles M. Coffin of Kenyon College, contains all of Donne’s poetry\n> and a generous selection of his prose. (*Spring 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML collection based on the contents of Donne’s *Complete Poetry\nand Selected Prose*, ed. John Hayward (Nonesuch Press, 1929). Printed\nfrom plates made from a new typesetting. Published spring 1952. *WR* 5\nApril 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nThe ML could probably have bought a set of duplicate plates from\nNonesuch Press, but Stein wanted a different sequence of contents (Stein\nto Coffin, 13 July 1950) and Coffin made some additions to the text. The\nML typesetting was 180 pages shorter than the 1929 edition and therefore\nmore economical to print.\n\n*The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne* was originally\nscheduled for inclusion in MLCE in fall 1951, but the College Edition\nwas postponed and eventually cancelled. Coffin received a flat fee of\n$250 for his work on the volume (Stein to Coffin, 27 June 1950) and an\nadditional $100 in spring 1952 when it was published in the regular ML.\nStein explained the postponement of the College Edition as follows:\n\n> There has been considerable shuffling of our schedule of volumes in\n> the Modern Library and in the Modern Library College Editions, and a\n> number of titles which we had planned to bring out this fall are being\n> carried over into next year. Among these is your edition of John\n> Donne. Largely because of the increased production costs (and they\n> have already, as you can well imagine, been disproportionately high\n> for the sixty-five cent books), we shall have to space out the College\n> Editions a little more than we have in the past in order to continue\n> getting favorable printing arrangements. This change of schedule is a\n> disappointment that I sincerely share with you, but the production\n> aspects of low-priced books have become more decisive than ever\n> before. (Stein to Coffin, 15 May 1951)\n\nA volume of Donne’s *Poetry and Prose*, ed. Frank J. Warnke, finally\nappeared in MLCE in 1967.\n\n"

Lanier also favored *The Pathfinder*.\nThe response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone\na decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must\nadmit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present\nseems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but\nI can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters\nI have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948).\n\nThree years later Stein wrote to several professors about Cooper and\nasked which titles were needed. Based on the responses he asked Cerf\nwhat he thought of a Giant containing *The Deerslayer*, *The Pilot*, and\n*Satanstoe*, which Robert E. Spiller had mentioned as his favorite\nCooper novel.

(*Fall 1952*)\n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Great German Short Novels and\nStories*, ed. Bennett A. Cerf (256). Published December 1952. *WR* 10\nJanuary 1953. First printing: 3,000 copies were received for binding on\n16 December; it has not been ascertained whether that represented the\nentire first printing. Discontinued 1974/75.\n\nLange suggested a revision of the ML anthology *Great German Short\nNovels and Stories* after writing a new introduction in 1950 to Goethe’s\n*Faust* which appeared in regular ML printings as well as MLCE (1930:\n200c). He told Stein that the anthology “is now about the only\ncollection of German narrative prose in English translation that the\nstudent is able to buy. At the same time the selection is extremely\nunsatisfactory and the translation more than objectionable” (Lange to\nStein, 31 January 1951). Cerf agreed that a revision was needed (Stein\nto Lange, 15 May 1951), and Lange submitted a tentative table of\ncontents in September. Cerf and Stein approved the outline with two\nexceptions: two stories by Grillparzer and Eichendorff were omitted for\neconomic reasons to keep the revised anthology from exceeding the length\nof the original, and they wanted to retain Storm’s *Immensee* instead of\nreplacing it with the author’s *Carsten Curator* “because it has become\na ‘classic’ in the minds of so many people.” Stein agreed with Lange\nthat “the introduction should avoid being a collection of biographical\nsketches and that it should instead be a lively critical essay on the\nstories in the book” (Stein to Lange, 3 December 1951). Of the seventeen\nselections in Lange’s anthology, seven were retained from Cerf’s\noriginal anthology (Goethe’s “Sorrows of Young Werther” appeared in a\ndifferent translation) and ten were new. Lange received a flat fee of\n$500 for his introduction, translations and editorial work. The ML paid\nthe cost of permissions. New permissions fees were not required for\nselections retained from the original anthology, including Mann’s “Death\nin Venice” (see 256).\n\n"

ML\nedition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published fall\n1952. *WR* 11 October 1952. First printing: Not ascertained.\nDiscontinued 1969/70. Reissued 1977–1990.\n\nThe negotiations that resulted in publication of *Selected Stories of\nFranz Kafka* took three years and were complicated by Schocken Books’\nhopes to publish additional volumes of Kafka’s stories and uncertainty\nover the copyright status of Kafka’s stories in the U.S. Rahv began to\nplan a collection of thirteen stories selected from *The Penal* *Colony*\nand *The Great Wall of China* in 1949. Nahum N. Glatzer of Schocken\nBooks appears to have agreed verbally to a $2,000 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML collection. But when Cerf sent the\ncontract Glatzer telephoned to say he couldn’t sign it and suggested\nresuming negotiations in six months (Cerf to Schocken Books, 28 November\n1949; Glatzer to Cerf, 6 December 1949). Cerf replied that the ML would\nuse other translations of the two most important stories and find other\nmaterial to fill out the volume (Cerf to Glatzer, 7 December 1949).\n\nCommins checked into the copyright status of Kafka’s stories and\nreported:\n\n> The right to issue the Kafka stories is far more complicated than we\n> at first thought. Apparently, the German volumes are protected, by\n> reciprocal agreement, if not by registered copyright, and the\n> ownership resides in the Estate of Franz Kafka. Max Brod, executor of\n> this Estate, must have given these rights to Schocken.\n>\n> I telephoned Kurt Wolff, who was the original publisher of Kafka’s\n> stories during the writer’s lifetime and he insists that any use of\n> the stories—whether they appeared in American magazines or not,\n> whether they were authorized or not, and whether their copyright is\n> valid or not, could be litigated by Schocken. The translations other\n> than those in the Schocken volumes are unauthorized.\n>\n> Kurt Wolff, out of his friendship for the house, offers to intercede\n> with Schocken himself and try to persuade him to grant his permission\n> for the use of existing translations or new translations of Kafka’s\n> short stories. We should get Schocken’s consent or abandon the project\n> unless we want to be on the losing side of a suit. I recommend that we\n> make this attempt through Kurt Wolff and see what happens.\n>\n> I have written to the Register of Copyrights asking for a search into\n> the copyright status of all of Kafka’s short stories. (Commins memo to\n> Cerf, 8 December 1949)\n\nAfter analyzing the report from the Register of Copyrights Commins\nreported: “The more we study it, the more apparent is it that Shocken\n\\[*sic*\\] has tied up American copyrights for the main Kafka items.\nThere are a few, however, included in Rahv’s original Table of Contents\nwhich are not protected. These would require new translation, but there\nwould not be enough of them to make the kind of book we want. We are\nconvinced that the only way to get the book we want is to reopen\nnegotiations with Shocken \\[*sic*\\]” (Commins memo to Cerf, 19 January\n1950).\n\nKurt Wolff talked with Salman Schocken on the ML’s behalf and reported\nthat Schocken had two additional volumes of Kafka stories in preparation\nwhich were supposed to be on the market “in a few months.” Schocken\nproposed that the ML wait one year after their publication and then make\na selection from all four volumes. Wolff promised to follow up and help\narrange the deal with Schocken (Commins memo to Cerf, 26 July 1949).\nLittle had changed, however, when Wolff talked with Schocken ten months\nlater. The two new volumes, one of which was described as a revision of\n*The Great Wall of China* with additional stories, were still\nforthcoming, and Schocken repeated his willingness to discuss a ML\nselection after these two books “have won the market” (Salman Schocken\nto Wolff, 17 May 1951; enclosed with Wolff letter to Commins, 21 May\n1951).\n\nCerf told Salman Schocken late in 1951 that he wanted to bring out the\nKafka collection in April or May 1952 and indicated that the ML could\nproduce its own volume of Kafka stories if necessary (Cerf to Schocken,\n16 November 1951). Schocken’s position had not changed. On 7 April 1952\nRandom House signed a contract with Farrar, Straus & Young for the\npublication of a ML collection of Kafka’s writings including “The Great\nWall of China” with an introduction to be provided by Random House. It\nis not clear which translations were involved, but Farrar, Straus &\nYoung guaranteed that they were the owners of all rights granted. Random\nHouse’s attorneys transmitted the news to Schocken Books (Horace Manges,\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges, to Schocken Books, 24 July 1952). At this point\nSchocken capitulated.\n\nThe ML edition of *Selected Stories of Franz Kakfa*, reprinted by\narrangement with Schocken Books and using their translations, appeared\nthree months later.\n\nThe ML paid Schocken royalties of 10 cents a copy, and Rahv received\n$250 for his introduction. The size of the first printing has not been\nascertained, but subsequent printings were as follows: two printings of\n5,000 and 7,000 copies (1953); two printings of 7,000 copies (1957); two\nprintings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1959); 10,000 copies (1960); two\nprintings of 10,000 copies each (1961); 10,000 copies (1962). These\nfigures have been compiled from scattered records of binding orders;\nsome records may be missing (there are no records for 1958) but the\ntotal of 107,000 copies for the period 1953–62 is probably accurate\nwithin 20,000 copies or so.\n\n"

Her\nreasons for choosing *Coming of Age in Samoa* are discussed in the\npreface to the ML edition. She writes:\n\n> My reasons are by no means simple. It is the first book of its kind,\n> and so it seems appropriate to choose it for inclusion in a library I\n> have not previously entered.

The descriptions of Samoan life are\n> less compromised by considerations of theory, by consciousness of aim,\n> by involved speculations and experiments with a process we have come\n> to call communication, than are the descriptions I have written of the\n> way of life of other primitive peoples. Also, as the special problems\n> to which an anthropologist addresses his research change with the\n> years, the more complicated problems are likely to become dated very\n> fast. The chief themes of anthropological work—the exploration of the\n> limits human nature sets to human social inventions, and the\n> potentialities of human nature not yet trapped by human social\n> invention—are far less likely to seem dated.

First\nprinting: Not ascertained.\n\nStein prepared a list of six of Shaw’s plays that he considered\ndesirable for a ML collection: *Arms and the Man*, *Candida*, *Major\nBarbara*, *Pygmalion*, *Heartbreak House*, and *Saint Joan*. The only\nimportant play omitted, he told Cerf, was *Man and Superman* which had a\nvery long preface (Stein memo to Cerf, 24 December 1952). The final\nselection, including the addition of *Caesar and Cleopatra*, was\nprobably made by Cerf. Kronenberger received $200 for his introduction\n(Cerf to Kronenberger, 2 June 1953).\n\nIt was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure\npermission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight\ncontrol over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of\nhis plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his\nopposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a\nmillion copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies\neach—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to\npublish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s, *Four Plays* and *Saint\nJoan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956: 484). The only other\nvolume by Shaw in the ML was his early novel *An Unsocial Socialist*\n(15), published in the series in fall 1917.

So\nlittle of Blake’s poetry was omitted that Stein suggested trying to get\nit all in, but Frye replied that he thought it best not to put all the\nshorter poems in and that he had deliberately left out some of the early\nprose-poems and later unpublished doggerel on the grounds that they\nbelonged only in a complete edition. Twenty pages of Blake’s marginalia\nwere included at Stein’s request (Stein to Frye, 21 October 1952; Frye\nto Stein, 5 December 1952).

Stein initially proposed a volume of six or seven\nplays to be published in MLCE and told Harris, “I do hope we can avoid\nall but the most imperative annotations, since I should like the impact\nupon the reader to be such that he will feel that the plays can be read\nand enjoyed without constant reference to explanatory notes” (Stein to\nHarris, 27 June 1950; 10 October 1950). Harris proposed seven plays and\nrecommended omitting *The Beaux’ Stratagem* if only six could be\npublished. He indicated that for his own class purposes he would like to\nadd *The Rehearsal* (Harris to Stein, 25 July 1950); Stein estimated the\nnumber of pages required and agreed to its inclusion.\n\n*Restoration Plays* and *Eighteenth-Century Plays* (1952: 448) were\nconceived as companion volumes. Stein and Ricardo Quintana, who selected\nthe plays in the latter volume, agreed to follow “the principle of using\nthe first editions of each play unless there is good reason to believe\nthat a later edition incorporates changes by the author” (Stein to\nHarris, 28 July 1950). Stein asked Harris if it would be appropriate to\nset *Restoration Plays* from first editions of all of the plays except\n*The Rehearsal*, which was revised by Villiers in the 1675 edition\n(Stein to Harris, 31 August 1950). Harris approved, and Stein secured\nphotostats of the appropriate editions from Yale University Library. A\ntextual note similar to the one quoted in the entry for\n*Eighteenth-Century Plays* appears on p. \\[iv\\] of *Restoration Plays*:\n\n> The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first\n> editions. The sole exception is *The Rehearsal*, which is based upon\n> the third quarto (1675) since it contains, as the title page of that\n> edition indicates, amendments and large additions by the author.\n>\n> A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early\n> editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in\n> spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small\n> number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.\n\nHarris submitted the manuscript of his introduction in spring 1951. The\nvolume was originally scheduled for MLCE; after publication in MLCE was\ntwice postponed Harris was informed that it would appear first in the\nregular ML (Stein to Harris, 15 May 1951; 7 August 1952; Leonore Crary\nto Harris, 5 May 1953)."

His artistic penetration into the heart of things is still\n> being analyzed and discussed with increasing awareness of its depth\n> and complexity. This selection by Professor Mabbott, who has also\n> provided notes, creates a well-balanced picture of Poe as poet,\n> short-story writer, literary critic and essayist. It presents a\n> comprehensive view of the man whose influence on American as well as\n> European literature was profound. The art of the short story in\n> America was significantly advanced by Poe, who also shaped the\n> development of the detective story.\n>\n> Poe’s ability to blend the macabre and surreal with consummate\n> craftsmanship has remained a memorable contribution to American\n> literature.

First printing: Not ascertained.\n\nMabbott received a flat fee of $250 for writing the introduction and\nselecting the contents. Stein sent him an additional $100 when the\ncollection was published in the regular ML (Stein to Mabbott, 23 June\n1953). Mabbott wrote Stein before the final contents had been\ndetermined: “I raved in the introduction about HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD\nARTICLE but left it out as it includes the word nigger. . . . However,\nit occurs to me that I might emend the spelling, as I do not pretend we\nhave a scientific text.” He was also concerned about the poem *The\nSleeper* on the grounds that “most kids are horrified” by the line in\nthe final version of the text, “Soft may the worms about her creep!” He\nsuggested using an earlier version or omitting the poem altogether\n(Mabbott to Stein, 29 October 1950).\n\n*How to Write a Blackwood Article* does not appear in *The Selected\nPoetry and Prose of Edgar Allan Poe*, and Mabbott’s discussion of it in\nthe introduction appears to have been cut. *The Sleeper* is included in\nits final text.\n\n“The text of this edition is drawn substantially from James A.\nHarrison’s *Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe* by the kind permission of\nthe publishers, Thomas Y. Crowell Company of New York. I have departed\nfrom the Harrison text on a few occasions, notably in the case of *The\nCask of Amontillado*, where I am sure Griswold had a later revision. In\none or two instances I have preferred versions not absolutely final but\npreferred by most critics. Poe was a meticulous and thorough reviser of\nhis imaginative works, and instances of unwise revision are\nexceptionally rare.” (“Note,” p. xvi)\n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\n\nPoe, *Best Tales* (1924) 112\n\nPoe, *Complete Tales and Poems* (Giant, 1938) G38"

Reissued 1980–91.\n\nKlopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition of *Civilization of the\nRenaissance in Italy*. Stein thought the idea was a good one and\nindicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo\nHolborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some\nrequired college sale and am quite confident that it will have a\nsatisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October\n1953). Holborn received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11\nNovember 1953).\n\nThe ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the\npublic domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf\noffered George Allen & Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a\ncourtesy fee of $500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any\nconsiderable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that\nwill balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities\nbut less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953).\nThe ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen & Unwin\nand includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C.\nMiddlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged\nrendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by\ncomparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig\nGoldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes\nand has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material\npreceded by asterisks” (p. \\[iv\\]).\n\n"

The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land\n> remote geographically and in way of life from the western world.

Published spring\n1954. *WR* 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1\nJanuary 1960.\n\nRandom House published an edition of *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of\nIspahan* with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy\nBaldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938\ndividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it\nwas printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s\nformat.\n\nStein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an\nintroduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of $200, but Haight was\ntoo busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November\n1953). He then approached Altick, offering him $150. He wrote, “What we\nhave in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving\nlargely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth\nreading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail,\nbut there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a\nbook published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide\npleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first\nappeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his\nautobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition\nof James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, *The Adventures of Hajji\nBaba of Ispahan* . . . which, although it never came near to being one\nof the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints,\nearned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one\nof our daughters” (Altick, *A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an\nAdventurous Scholar,* p. 200).\n\nAlthough Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three\nprintings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and\nspring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume.\n\nSeveral months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I\nhave just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an\nadvance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I\nall change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to\nAltick, 23 September 1954).\n\n***Fall***"

Signed: PG \\[Paul\nGaldone\\].\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify\n> Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our\n> times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with\n> startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer\n> appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The\n> twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly\n> understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue\n> of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but\n> they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic\n> material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human\n> experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and\n> psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that\n> experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved. (*Fall\n> 1954*)\n\n*A Curtain of Green* originally published with Porter introduction by\nDoubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as\n*A Curtain of Green and Other Stories* by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947.\n*The Wide Net and Other Stories* originally published by Harcourt, Brace\n& Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from\nHarcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First\nprinting: 5,000 copies.\n\nCerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt,\nBrace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager\nsent *A Curtain of Green*, *The Robber Bridegroom*, *The Wide Net*,\n*Delta Wedding*, and *The Golden Apples*, expressing the hope that the\nML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The\nreprint contract for *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* was signed a\nmonth later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy.\nThere was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk\nreports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (*Eudora Welty:\nA Bibliography of Her Work*, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete\ninformation about printings and sales is not available in the RH\narchives, but the following evidence is suggestive: *Selected Stories of\nEudora Welty* does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than\n2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and\nit sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500\ntitles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the\ntitles that survived.\n\nTextual variants between the first edition of *A Curtain of Green*\n(Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text\nof the Modern Library *A Curtain of Green*” (1979). Polk writes:\n\n> In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of *A\n> Curtain of Green*. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions\n> or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a\n> copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss\n> Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she\n> responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY:\n> Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John\n> Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of *A\n> Curtain of Green* is two typesettings removed from the first American\n> edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in\n> any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences\n> between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be\n> considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted\n> the Harcourt, Brace text in its *Selected Stories* (NY, 1954), it of\n> course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some\n> importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of *A\n> Curtain of Green* is both the only one currently in print and the text\n> most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6)\n\nIn his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the\nHarcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in\nprint and the one most frequently cited.\n\n"

First printing: 5,000 copies.\nDiscontinued fall 1959.\n\nThe ML paid Coward-McCann a $1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents\na copy. Publishers were not enthusiastic about McCord’s title. An\nearlier reprint changed the title to *The Modern Treasury of Humorous\nVerse* (Garden City Books, 1945). Cerf wanted to publish the ML edition\nunder its subtitle, *An Anthology of American and British Humorous and\nWitty Verse* with *What Cheer* as a subtitle (Cerf to Tom Coward, 16\nJuly 1954). But McCord asked Cerf to retain the original title. “I gave\nfive years of enormously hard work into the making of that book,” he\nwrote. “I loved the title at the time. . . . *What Cheer* is short and\nsweet and was very easily absorbed by my readers and correspondents. I\nwanted it to become the name of an approximate classic in the field. I\nthink, too, that since this is my one little monument to scholarship\n(the notes, I mean) I feel all the more strongly that I should hang on\nto the title for sentimental reasons” (McCord to Cerf, 21 July 1954).\n\nMcCord wanted to include thirty new verses in the ML edition, and he\nsuggested adding two new indexes—an index of last lines and an index of\npeople, places, animals, etc. Cerf indicated that the index plates could\nnot be changed, but that McCord could add twenty to thirty new pages if\nhe really wanted to—though Cerf believed the book would sell just as\nwell without them (Cerf to McCord, 28 September 1954). McCord included\nthe new verses in his introduction to the ML edition, “Last Word First.”\nPermission fees for the new verses came to $220.50; the costs for\ntypesetting and making plates for “Last Word First” and other matter new\nto the ML edition were $264.65 (Stein memo to Cerf, 6 May 1955).\n\nFifteen months after publication Cerf wrote McCord, “WHAT CHEER isn’t\nsetting any worlds on fire in the Modern Library edition, but I think it\nhas justified its presence there. As for my own personal feelings, I am\nproud to have it on the list” (Cerf to McCord, 27 September 1956). Three\nyears later he had to tell McCord that *What Cheer* had “dropped so far\nbelow our minimum requirements that we won’t be able to keep it in the\nseries. I am genuinely sorry because I loved the collection myself, as\nyou know, but I guess the Modern Library patrons just don’t want this\nkind of book in our format” (Cerf to McCord, 29 October 1959)."

Our world\nbears little outward relation to the one surveyed by Francis Bacon when,\nat the beginning of the seventeenth century, he issued his call for the\nadvancement of learning through the method of inductive science. Yet it\nis precisely his spirit of scientific experimentation which has become\nthe foundation of modern science and, therefore, of the modern world\nitself. It is then very worth our while to read this volume of Bacon’s\ngreatest writings—the *Advancement of Learning*, the *Novum Organum*,\nthe *New Atlantis* and the famous *Essays*, which show his keen insight\ninto the practical problems of human conduct as well as his mastery of\nEnglish prose.

Sales had been small when Harper’s took over\n*Brave New World* from Doubleday but then increased steadily. Sales\ntripled in 1939; *Brave New World* sold 100 more copies in 1941 than it\nhad in 1939, giving Harper’s a gross profit that year of $300; sales\nthrough July 1942 were up 10 percent from the previous year (Henry\nHoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 28 August 1942). Sales remained strong\nwhen it was reissued in September 1946 with Huxley’s foreword, with\n7,500 copies in print by December (William H. Rose, Jr., Harper & Bros.,\nto Klopfer, 3 December 1946). In 1951 Harper’s sold nearly 2,000 copies\nin the $3.00 trade edition and 7,500 copies in a 95-cent College Edition\n(Rose to Cerf, 27 May 1952).\n\nHarper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement\nfor Cerf to edit *Reading for Pleasure*, an anthology published by\nHarper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to\ndo this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a\npiece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to\ndo Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern\nLibrary.

He received an additional $100 for writing the\nintroduction. A year before Chekhov’s *Best Plays* was published Stein\nhad reported to Cerf: “The translations of Chekhov plays in the Modern\nLibrary were done by Constance Garnett a long time ago and are no longer\nregarded as the best available ones. It is now possible to get the\nexcellent translations by Stark Young of Chekhov’s four major plays,\n*The Cherry Orchard*, *The Three Sisters*, *Uncle Vanya*, and *The Sea\nGull*. The first three are controlled by Leah Salisbury and I talked to\nLois Berman there to find out whether we might have reprint rights;\nthere seems to be no problem unless Young vetoes the idea. . . . At this\nstage everything is exploratory only, but may I have your OK to arrange\nfor the Young translations if they are all available to us? I will of\ncourse go over the terms with you before things go too far” (Stein memo\nto Cerf, 18 November 1955). Cerf wrote on the memo: “YOU BET!”\n\nWith the Young translation of Chekhov, *Best Plays* the ML reverted to\nthe spelling “Chekhov” after using “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring\n1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of the spelling Tchekov in the typescript\nof her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably\nresponsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le\nGallienne file).\n\n"

Stein also talked to\nKlopfer about the work. He then wrote to William Oman of Oxford\nUniversity Press in New York: “Several of us here recently discovered\nthat we share a very deep enthusiasm for Alfred Zimmern’s *The Greek\nCommonwealth* and we should like very much to include it in the Modern\nLibrary” (Stein to Oman, 24 June 1955).\n\nAn internal RH memo indicated in 1968 that the reprint contract with\nOxford University Press did not give the ML the right to transfer *The\nGreek Commonwealth* to Vintage Books, RH’s quality paperback series. A\ndecision was made at that time to retain it in the ML but to reprint in\nas small a quantity as economically feasible (Berenice Hoffman to Don\nSinger, 19 November 1968)."

Front flap with first paragraph as jacket A and second paragraph\nas follows: “This book offers thirty-two of the finest stories by one of\nAmerica’s most distinguished writers.” (*Fall 1967 format*)\n\nOriginal ML collection. Published October 1956. *WR* 5 November 1956.\nFirst printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–1990.\n\nO’Hara selected the contents in November 1955, choosing the stories he\nliked best from the 129 stories in four previous collections: *The\nDoctor’s Son and Other Stories* (Harcourt, Brace, 1935), *Files on\nParade* (Harcourt, Brace, 1939), *Pipe Night* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce,\n1945) and *Hellbox* (Random House, 1947). He refused to include anything\nfrom *Pal Joey* (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1940) because of a falling-out\nwith Richard Rodgers, who wrote the music for the Broadway show based on\nO’Hara’s stories (Cerf to Lionel Trilling, 27 March 1956). Twenty of the\n32 stories in the ML collection were from *Pipe Night* and *Hellbox*.\nO’Hara also wrote a foreword intended for the ML edition which\nconcluded:\n\n> Most of them \\[the stories\\] were written in the twenty years from\n> 1930 to 1950, during which I believe I wrote more short stories for\n> *The New Yorker* than any other author. Aloofness is not one of my\n> characteristics, so I cannot pretend that I have not been grievously\n> hurt by the magazine, which in commenting on my stories was pleased to\n> call me “the master” but in reviewing my novels was perfectly willing\n> to make fun of me and even to distort what I said by the cheap trick\n> of quoting out of context. The high principles that they peddle in\n> Notes and Comment don’t even last till the back of the book. Well,\n> damn their eyes.\n>\n> I don’t think I’ll write any more short stories. In very recent years\n> I have been made sharply aware of the passage of time and the\n> preciousness of it, and there are so many big things I want to do. But\n> during the Thirties and Forties these stories were part of me as I was\n> part of those nights and days, when time was cheap and everlasting and\n> one could say it all in 2,000 words. (Typescript in RH Collection,\n> Columbia University Library; quoted in Bruccoli, *O’Hara Concern*, p.\n> 233).\n\nThe foreword was never published. RH’s attorneys strongly recommended\ndeleting the phrase “cheap trick” and the sentence that followed it\n(Weil, Gotshal & Manges to RH, attention Jess Stein, 8 December 1955).\nCerf agreed that O’Hara’s comments were ill-advised and tried to\npersuade him to tone down his language:\n\n> Before we go to press with the Modern Library collection of your\n> Selected Stories, I feel that I owe it to you as a friend and myself\n> as your publisher to make one last appeal to you to make two small but\n> important alterations in your Introduction. If you say “No” this time,\n> I promise never to mention the matter again.\n>\n> I believe very deeply that the words “cheap trick” should be left out\n> of the next-to-the-last paragraph, as well as the entire sentence,\n> “The high principles that they peddle in Notes and Comment don’t even\n> last till the back of the book.” Your original reaction to the A RAGE\n> TO LIVE review in the New Yorker was completely justified. I do not\n> think, however, that the Introduction to a book of your Selected\n> Stories in the Modern Library is the place to voice your resentment.\n> This Modern Library book will be a more or less permanent thing: a\n> collection of what you yourself have nominated as the best short\n> stories you have written. Why mar it with a totally irrelevant\n> reference to something virtually nobody except the people directly\n> concerned even remembers?\n>\n> I am sure you realize, John, that whether you leave these few words in\n> or take them out does not affect either Random House or myself. I just\n> hate to see you do something that I think is undignified and,\n> furthermore, might be considered gratuitous in light of what the New\n> Yorker did on TEN NORTH FREDERICK. \\[Harold\\] Ross, who was Editor of\n> the New Yorker when the review of A RAGE TO LIVE appeared, is dead;\n> \\[Brendan\\] Gill, who wrote the review, must have wished a thousand\n> times by this time that he hadn’t said what he did. What about all the\n> good friends that you still have on the New Yorker staff? You are\n> slapping at them as well as the people there whom you don’t like.\n>\n> I have another fear: if the Introduction goes in as it now stands,\n> several critics may spend so much time discussing the pros and cons of\n> your position that they will overlook the stories themselves.\n>\n> There it is. I hope you will reconsider. If you won’t, tell me so and\n> that will be that (Cerf to O’Hara, 20 March 1956).\n\nThere is no response from O’Hara in the RH archives. He probably\ntelephoned and asked that the foreword be dropped altogether. Cerf\nimmediately contacted Trilling and offered him $500 to write an\nintroduction to be submitted by 1 May (Cerf to Trilling, 27 March 1956).\n\nThere were seven printings prior to the 1980 reissue (Bruccoli, *John\nO’Hara: A Descriptive Bibliography*, p. 216).\n\n"

(*Spring 1957*)\n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific*\n(Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of\nAsia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri*\n(RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing:\n7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.\n\nIn the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition\nof his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the\npublisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a\nchance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the\npoorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start\nnew chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:\n\n> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and\n> another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about\n> Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long\n> humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word\n> *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word\n> to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps\n> even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books\n> appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what\n> I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I\n> have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain\n> stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have\n> retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I\n> would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).\n\nMichener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of\n*Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April\n1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August\n2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random\nHouse in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long\nand highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of\nSaxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose\nthe firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to\nuse a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has\nmade from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to\nDorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton\nUniversity Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a\n1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at\nMadison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old\nMansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174).\n\nInconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are\nreproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a\njacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of\nToko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”\n\n"

Harper’s finally offered\nthe ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading\nfor Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf\ntold it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a\nlong, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found\nirresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD\nand Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have\nbeen pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted”\n(Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10\npercent of the retail price. *Brave New World* (485) was published in\nthe ML in fall 1956.\n\nBowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D\nof the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month\nClub using duplicate plates supplied by Harper & Bros. In his list of\nvariations that distinguish state D (p. 55), however, the nose of the\ndog on the fly title (p. \\[1\\]) is indicated as absent.

In 1961, when ML books were selling for\n$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based\non a retail price of $1.45. (*Medieval Romances* was published at $1.65,\nbut the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still\n$1.45.)

He had\nreceived a letter which stated: “You may know those who select the\ntitles for Modern Library Editions. Could you persuade them to publish\nsome of Dr. C. G. Jung’s writings. They are so scattered it is difficult\nto obtain the more important parts.” Fadiman commented, “Not as crazy as\nit sounds—the Jung cult is fairly large, the name better and better\nknown, and the Bollingen translations are good and easily buyable from\nKurt \\[Wolff, the founder of Pantheon Books\\]” (Fadiman to Klopfer, 13\nApril 1956). Klopfer replied, “We have been negotiating with the\nBollingen people for months, and expect to have a title in the Modern\nLibrary in 1957” (Klopfer to Fadiman, 20 April 1956).\n\n*The Basic Writings of C. J, Jung* sold well. There was a second\nprinting of 7,000 copies in fall 1959.\n\n"

The company was distinguished, the conversation learned. Need\n> was mentioned for a history of Italian painting from the days of\n> Giotto. Turning to Vasari, the Cardinal suggested that he should\n> undertake the task, adding, “whereby you would also advance the arts.”\n>\n> Four years later *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and\n> Architects* was published in Florence. The time and the man had come\n> together to produce a lasting work of literature, and to record a\n> great moment in the history of art: the high noon of the Italian\n> Renaissance.\n>\n> Vasari had known many of the men of whom he wrote; he had seen most of\n> the pictures that he describes; his style is as vital and lively as\n> the age in which he lived; as Bernard Berenson says, “Everything\n> considered, his interpretation is still the best there is.” (*Fall\n> 1959*)\n\nML abridgment of the DeVere translation originally published in London\nby the Medici Society (10 vols., 1912–15). Published October 1959. *WR*\n19 October 1959. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.\n\nLinscott received a flat fee of $1,500 for his editorial work. He\noriginally planned to use the mid-nineteenth-century translation of Mrs.\nJonathan Foster and had cut it to 170,000 words when he discovered the\nDeVere translation, which he described as “a much better and terser\ntranslation that will enable me to get the same text into 150,000\nwords.” He told Cerf, “I will have to redo all the work of preparing the\nmanuscript but the translation is so much better that I’m sure it’s\nworth doing, quite apart from the saving in composition and plates”\n(Linscott to Cerf, 7 January 1957). Linscott abridged the 10-volume\nDeVere translation, which had never been published or copyrighted in the\nU.S., “simply by omitting the second rate artists, description of\npictures which no longer exist, and some of Vasari’s interminable\nmoralizing. As a result American readers will have all the essential\nVasari in a brisk and readable text. I have even gone so far as to\nchange the Renaissance measurements into feet (the first time this has\nbeen done) so that when Vasari gives the dimensions of a statue or a\nbuilding it will be meaningful instead of meaningless to American\nreaders” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957).\n\nLinscott was pleased with the way the ML abridgment turned out, and he\nthought his introduction was “the best I have ever done” (Linscott to\nCerf, 7 January 1957). He told Cerf, “Except for the . . . Everyman and\nan expensive illustrated edition by S & S \\[Simon and Schuster\\] with\ndisgracefully butchered text, ours will be the only Vasari in print.\nInstead of using the century old standard translation which is stiff,\ninaccurate and virtually unreadable we have used a lively and strictly\naccurate translation.” (Linscott to Cerf, 15 June 1957)."

ML edition (pp.\n\\[*5*\\]–302) printed from Little, Brown plates with decorative rules\nremoved from table of contents, fly title and chapter heads in all\nprintings of 516a. Published September 1959. *WR* 28 September 1959.\nFirst printing: 7,500. Discontinued 1964/65.\n\nCerf told Salinger in 1957 that he hoped *Nine Stories* could be\nincluded in the ML someday (Cerf to Salinger, 29 April 1957). He\nsubsequently arranged with Little, Brown to reprint *The* *Catcher in\nthe Rye* (504) and *Nine Stories* in 1958 and 1959. In 1963 Salinger\nasked that the ML’s five-year reprint contracts not be renewed; see the\nentry for *The Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504). Arthur Thornhill, the\npresident of Little, Brown, wrote Klopfer (1 April 1964) giving formal\nnotice that termination of the *Nine Stories* contract would become\neffective on 1 October 1964 and that the ML would have the right to\ndispose of any copies on hand.\n\nThe Little, Brown half title (*Nine Stories*) is sandwiched between two\ndecorative rules. ML printings omit the decorative rules and add “*by*\nJ. D. <span class=\"smallcaps\">Salinger</span>” below the half title. The\nML also adds the series statement “THE MODERN LIBRARY | *OF THE WORLD’S\nBEST BOOKS* followed by a rule at the top of the page and a 6-line\nstatement preceded by a rule inviting readers to request an illustrated\nfolder listing each volume in the series.\n\nPrintings between 1960 and 1962 were as follows: 7,000 copies (1960),\n15,000 copies (1962), and 5,000 copies (1962); there was also a printing\nin spring 1963. Sales figures for the ML edition of *Nine Stories* are\nincluded in the entry for *The* *Catcher in the Rye* (1958: 504).\n\nThe ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s\nbooks were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering\nhope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine\nStories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and\ncontinued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through\n1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new\ntitles the following publishing season; ML 301, the number of *Nine\nStories*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1969 when\n*Renaissance Philosophy*, vol. 2*: The Transalpine Thinkers* (1969: 611)\nwas published as ML 301*.*\n\n"

As the *New York Herald\n> Tribune* commented, Mr. Bretall “has let Kierkegaard speak for himself\n> . . . he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the\n> prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what\n> such remarks should be.” (*Fall 1959*)\n\n*Jacket B1:* Pictorial in deep orange yellow (72), vivid reddish orange\n(34) and black on coated white paper with sketch of Kierkegaard at left\nand lettering in black, vivid reddish orange and deep orange yellow, all\nagainst white background; lettering on spine against deep orange yellow\nbackground.\n\n> Front flap:<br>\n> First paragraph as 518a except “S. K.” is replaced by “Kierkegaard”\n> and “on to the philosophical and psychological works” is replaced by\n> “and continues with the philosophical and psychological works of his\n> maturity.”\n>\n> Second paragraph abbreviated with square brackets and ellipsis in\n> original: “\\[Mr. Bretall\\] has let Kierkegaard speak for himself . . .\n> he has made his selections carefully and sensitively, and the\n> prefatory remarks that accompany each selection are models of what\n> such remarks should be.” —**New York Herald Tribune** (*Spring 1967*)\n\nOriginally published by Princeton University Press, 1946. ML edition\n(pp. \\[v\\]–\\[xxvi\\], \\[1\\]–494) printed from offset plates\nphotographically reduced from the Princeton University Press edition\nwith frontispiece portrait of Kierkegaard omitted and fly title reset.\nPublished fall 1959. *WR* 5 October 1959. First printing: 15,000 copies.\n\nThe ML paid Princeton University Press a $3,000 advance against\nroyalties of 10 cents a copy. *A Kierkegaard Anthology* had sold\nsteadily in its Princeton University Press edition and seems to have\ndone well in the ML. There was an unusually large ML printing of 22,200\ncopies in 1962.\n\n"
