<p>The Modern Library was the most important American reprint series of
significant works of literature and thought published in the twentieth
century. The series was founded in spring 1917 and published initially
by Boni &amp; Liveright. It was purchased in 1925 by Bennett Cerf, a young
Boni &amp; Liveright vice-president, who established a new firm, The Modern
Library, Inc., in partnership with Donald S. Klopfer. Initially Cerf and
Klopfer focused their attention on developing the Modern Library. In
1927 they began to publish and distribute fine limited editions under
the imprint Random House. Occasional trade books, including the first
authorized American edition of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, followed. In
1936 they reorganized the firm as Random House, Inc., and the Modern
Library became a subsidiary of its offspring.</p>
<p>The Modern Library differed from British reprint series like Everyman’s
Library and The World’s Classics in that its list was not limited
primarily to older classics in the public domain but also included
modern works that were reprinted by arrangement with the original
publishers. Modern Library books were the only inexpensive editions of
serious literary works that were widely distributed and readily
available in bookstores and major department stores throughout the
United States prior to the advent of quality paperbacks in 1953. For
most readers of serious books, the Modern Library was the most tangible
representation of the literary canon in the American cultural
marketplace.</p>
<p>The current project covers the titles that came into the series between
1925 and 1959 during the years Bennett Cerf was at Random House and the
Modern Library was the most prolific. This is part of a larger
unpublished project covering the entire span of the Modern Library, 1917
through 1986.</p>
<p>The current project contributes to bibliographical knowledge at several
levels. It provides a detailed bibliographical description of every
title that initially came into the Modern Library over 25 years and
follows it over time through multiple printing variants. It describes
the major variants of each title, documenting the historical evolution
of each title through reset texts, reset title pages, revised
translations, introductions added and dropped, redesigned dust jackets,
etc. The chronological arrangement, with indications of titles dropped
as well as added each year, provides a barometer of trends in literary
taste over time, and also reveals trends in printing and publishing
practices. The descriptive blurbs on the dust jackets tell us something
about the publisher’s conception of works in the series and the
intellectual context in which they were marketed to the reading public.
The transcription of blurbs from successive jackets reveals changes in
the ways Modern Library titles were presented to the public over time.</p>
<p>The publishing history notes, based on research in the Random House
archives,</p>
<p>constitute a pioneering contribution to our knowledge of
twentieth-century reprint publishing. The publishing history and
bibliographical analysis of reprint editions have received surprisingly
little scholarly attention; yet it is the reprint publisher who
generally disseminates a work to its largest audience, who determines
whether a work remains in print or ceases to be commercially available,
and who may even contribute something to the shaping of the canon. The
publishing history notes frequently provide information about reprint
negotiations between original publishers and the Modern Library. We
learn who initiated discussions, what the concerns of each party were,
and what the conventions of reprint agreements were at different periods
of the Modern Library’s history. Financial arrangements between the
Modern Library, original publishers, and authors are indicated whenever
possible, as is information about printings and sales. Much new
information is also provided about the publishing histories of
individual authors.</p>
<p>The bibliography also contributes something to bibliographical method.
Many Modern Library titles remained in the series for decades and were
reprinted every year or two. The description of such books presents a
number of bibliographical challenges. I have not attempted to track
every printing of every title. My approach has been to distinguish
bibliographical editions resulting from reset plates and then within
editions to establish what I call families of printings based on major
bibliographical variants, such as reset title pages and introductions
added and dropped. This approach is described below in the
Bibliographical Procedures section of the Introduction. I believe it
offers a useful approach to the bibliographical ordering of
twentieth-century books that exist in numerous printings made from the
same set of plates.</p>
<p>The origins of the bibliography go back to the fall of 1976 when I
learned about the Random House archives at Columbia University. I was in
New York investigating possible source materials for a dissertation on
American publishing history. The topic I was considering dealt with an
earlier period, and when I became aware of the depth and wealth of the
Random House archives, my first reaction was simply that someone would
have a lot of fun going through them. It was several days before I
considered the possibility that that person could be me. On my last
evening in New York, Terry Belanger, then of the School of Library
Service at Columbia University, casually mentioned at dinner that the
Modern Library series would be a good dissertation topic. I had just
enough time before my flight the next morning to stop by the Manuscript
Reading Room at Butler Library to confirm that the Random House archives
included sources for the Modern Library. When I returned to the
University of Chicago I had a new dissertation topic.  Dr. Belanger’s
interest in the project is woven through its history, and decades later
he, as a member of the Council of the Bibliographical Society of the
University of Virginia, encouraged the Society to undertake its
publication.</p>
<p>I spent fourteen months in 1977and 1978 immersed in the Random House
archives. That research gave me a vast amount of information about the
publication of individual Modern Library titles. Toward the end of my
time in New York I decided that I would eventually compile a
bibliography of the Modern Library in addition to writing a history of
the series. I began collecting Modern Library books systematically and
thinking about the kind of bibliography I would prepare. I’m a
self-taught bibliographer and it took me a few years to figure out what
I was doing. Meanwhile I was acquiring more and more books and
establishing contacts with other Modern Library collectors. These
contacts were facilitated by <em>The Modern Library Collector</em>, a
newsletter established in 1981 by Alan Oestreich, a collector in
Cincinnati. I have contributed a biannual column, &quot;Bibliographical Notes
and Queries,&quot; to <em>The Modern Library Collector</em> since 1982 and have
benefitted immeasurably from the exchange of information it has made
possible.</p>
<p>The bibliography is based on my research in the Random House archives
and the examination of nearly 20,000 Modern Library books in my own
collection and other major collections throughout the United States. I
am grateful to the private collectors who welcomed me into their homes
and provided hospitality and assistance. I am also grateful to the
National Endowment for the Humanities for a Travel to Collections grant
that partially supported visits to seven private collections during the
summer of 1992.</p>
<p>David Vander Meulen, Professor of English at the University
of Virginia, and the Council of the Bibliographical Society of the
University of Virginia under its long-term president G. Thomas Tanselle
have given invaluable support for this project for many years and are
responsible for leading the effort to publish it.  Dr. Vander Meulen’s
patience and support have been extraordinary.  Anne Ribble, Executive
Secretary for the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia,
and Elizabeth Lynch, Assistant to the Editor for the Bibliographical
Society, have contributed in multiple ways to the project. Their ability
to identify errors, ambiguities, and similar problems has been
invaluable and has led to significant improvements in the text.  I also
gratefully acknowledge the support of the co-publisher of this work, the
University of Virginia Library, which is providing the technology to
make the bibliography available to the world.  The imaginative and
meticulous work of Mike Durbin and his team has given fresh evidence of
the UVa Library’s preeminence in digital humanities.</p>
<p></p>

<p>I would like to express my sincere appreciation to my wife, Mary Ann
Sheble, who has lived with this project our entire married life and has
spent many hours assisting me with the technical and organizational
aspects of the project.</p>
