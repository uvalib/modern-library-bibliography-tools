    "season": "Fall",
    "titles_s_s_d": "Titles sought, suggested, declined\nTheodore Dreiser was one of the first authors Cerf contacted after buying the ML. Cerf expressed the hope that Free and Other Stories (106) would remain in the series for many years to come and that Dreiser would allow the ML to include one of his novels \"on a basis that I am sure could be made satisfactory to both of us\" (Cerf to Dreiser, 25 July 1925). Twelve Men (159) was added in 1928 and Sister Carrie (230) followed in 1932. An American Tragedy (G89), which B&L published in fall 1925 shortly after Cerf and Klopfer took over the ML, was reprinted as a ML Giant in 1956.\nWilla Cather and Edna St. Vincent Millay were among the first authors that Cerf tried to secure for the ML. He wanted Cather's Song of the Lark and a volume of plays by Millay, but the original publishers declined to grant reprint rights. The Song of the Lark sold too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a ML edition (Robert N. Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 4 September 1925). Cerf offered Appleton a five-year reprint contract with royalties of 8 cents a copy for Millay's plays \"Two Slatterns and a King,\" \"Aria da Capo,\" and \"The Lamp and the Bell\", indicating that he wanted to use Appleton plates for a first ML printing of 3,000 copies. Millay's publisher flatly rejected the offer (John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., to Cerf, 14 October 1925).\nAfter meeting Walter de la Mare during his trip to England in the summer of 1925, Cerf wrote to enlist his support for a ML edition of one of his works: \"I am particularly anxious to have a Walter de La [sic] Mare title in the library and am writing direct to you because before I proceed to interview any of the American publishers who hold the copyright to your works, I would like to hear from you which one of your books, in your opinion, would fit best in the series\" (Cerf to de la Mare, 16 October 1925). De la Mare replied that the decision must be left to his American publishers but indicated that he had asked his agent, James B. Pinker, to take up the matter with them (de la Mare to Cerf, 19 November 1925). Several weeks later Pinker told Cerf that none of de la Mare's American publishers were willing to authorize a reprint edition (James B. Pinker & Sons to Cerf, 14 December 1925).\nCerf contacted H. L. Mencken in 1926 about adding his Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche to the series, but Mencken replied that it was outmoded and in need of revision (Cerf to Mencken, 14 December 1925; Mencken to Cerf, 22 December 1925). Originally published in 1908, Mencken's study was the first book on Nietzsche in English (Hobson, Fred. Mencken: A Life, p. 89). It has been widely reprinted since it entered the public domain, including several reprint editions in the first decade of the twenty-first century.\nThe New York publisher Charles Renard offered to sell the ML its plates for J. M. Barrie's The Little Minister. Cerf replied that the ML would \"have no possible use for the plates . . . for some time to come\" but offered $50 for them (Charles Renard Co. to Cerf, 18 November 1925; Cerf to Renard Co., 30 November 1925). He later increased the offer to $200, but this appears to have been much less than Renard wanted."

    "season": "Spring",
    "titles_s_s_d": "Titles sought, suggested, declined\nCerf and Klopfer tried to include several titles published by Alfred A. Knopf after they bought the Modern Library, but Knopf refused to allow any of his publications to be reprinted in the series. His standards of production and design were the highest of any major American trade publisher, and he \"did not in those days care to see cheap editions published of our most distinguished books\" (Knopf, letter to GBN, 4 May 1977). Knopf also had other reasons for his coolness toward the ML. He associated Cerf with Horace Liveright, whom he loathed; in particular he resented the ML edition of W. H. Hudson's Green Mansions (90). It was Knopf's edition of Green Mansions, published in 1916, that established the work in the United States, but Knopf did not own the copyright. Green Mansions was in the U.S. public domain because its original American publication by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1904 used imported sheets of the English edition. The U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 limited American copyright to works that were printed and bound in the U.S.; the use of imported sheets cast a work irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. When Liveright added Green Mansions to the ML he did not pay royalties to Knopf. Moreover, he reprinted it with John Galsworthy's introduction, which had been written for the Knopf edition but does not appear to have been copyrighted. Relations between Knopf and the ML remained cool until January 1929, when a luncheon meeting organized with the help of Blanche Knopf led to friendly relations between the two firms.\nBefore 1929 Cerf appealed directly to several Knopf authors in an attempt to secure their support for ML editions of their works. He wrote to Joseph Hergesheimer:\nIt is all very well for us to advertise that our Modern Library contains books by all the great modern American writers … but I am extremely conscious of the fact that so long as no book of yours is on the list, there is a glaring gap that we cannot explain.\" He asked whether \"there is no way for us to have one of your books in the library. I find Mr. Knopf very elusive and vague on the subject of adding any volumes on which he owns the copyright to our series—a condition which I very much regret, because as you know, there are many other items besides your books on his list, which could be put in the Modern Library, to the advantage of everybody. . . . Is there not some way in which you can prevail upon Mr. Knopf to let us have one of your books?\nCerf indicated that the ML would prefer The Three Black Pennies above all others (Cerf to Hergesheimer, 30 March 1926). Hergesheimer's standing declined in the 1930s, and Cerf did not renew his offer after relations with Knopf improved.\nAnother Knopf author that Cerf tried to get for the ML was Arthur Machen. He was especially interested in Machen's The House of Souls (Knopf, 1922) or The Hill of Dreams (Knopf, 1923). During a 1926 visit to London Cerf took Machen to lunch at Claridge's and suggested a ML edition of one of the books. Machen's American agent indicated that both books were in the U.S. public domain but that the rights situation was complicated (Bernice Baumgarten to Cerf, 8 June 1927). Cerf indicated that Machen \"is anxious to see them in the Library; he is, as usual, as you know, in need of money. However, I believe that we could not do either of these books without getting into a serious jam with Knopf, and I would do nothing about them unless we had his definite consent\" (Cerf to Baumgarten, 8 June 1927). Machen also did not want to oppose Knopf in any way. He wrote: \"My reason is that it was he who brought me out in your country & did everything in his power to make me popular in America; also that he has paid me extremely handsome fees for writing introductions. . . . Therefore I should not feel happy in opposing him in any matter\" (Machen to Cerf, 5 July 1926). None of Machen's books were reprinted in the ML, but he wrote an introduction to the ML edition of Smollett's Expedition of Humphry Clinker (179). Cerf paid him $100 for the introduction, twice the ML's usual fee.\nOther works that Cerf considered adding to the series included Montesquieu's Persian Letters, Frank Swinnerton's Nocturne, and a volume of Edmond Rostand's plays to include Cyrano de Bergerac, Chanticleer, and L'Aiglon. He asked John Erskine to write an introduction to Persian Letters, but the volume never appeared (Cerf to Erskine, 4 October 1926). Swinnerton's literary agent declined the offer for Nocturne (Brandt & Brandt to Cerf, 16 October 1926), and the ML ended up publishing Cyrano de Bergerac (174) as a separate volume in 1929.\nHorace M. Kallen suggested a volume of Bernard Shaw's works. Shaw was opposed to inexpensive reprints of his plays and kept tight control of his copyrights. Cerf replied, \"If you can suggest how in hell's bells we can sign Shaw up for such a volume, you will immediately be elected Patron Saint of the Modern Library\" (Cerf to Kallen, 13 October 1926). It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw's death, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays. Shaw relaxed his opposition to inexpensive reprints on one occasion toward the end of his life. In 1946 he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.\nHenry Hoyns of Harper & Bros. suggested W. E. Woodward's Bunk, which Harper's had published three years earlier (Hoyns to Cerf, 15 March 1926). The Boston publisher Lewis C. Page, who had failed on more than one occasion to persuade B&L to reprint Gustav Frenssen's novel Holyland, repeated his suggestion to the ML's new owners (Page to ML, 17 September 1926). Page also suggested Balzac's Physiology of Marriage for the ML. Cerf responded, \"The Lord knows it is dull enough reading, but the title might make it a good seller, and there is just a chance that we will be able to make some arrangement with you for its publication late next year\" (Cerf to Page, 16 February 1926). Page replied, \"You are entirely right in your analysis of the literary qualities and trade appeal. It is heavy reading for Modernists, but the title is alluring, and we have a steady sale\" (Page to Cerf, 19 February 1926)."

    "year": "1927",
    "season": "spring",
    "titles_s_s_d": "Titles sought, suggested, declined\nThe original American publishers turned down Cerf's requests for reprint rights to several titles that the ML was able to publish between 1930 and 1933—Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises (190); John Dewey, Human Nature and Conduct (195); Joseph Conrad, Victory (238); Anatole France, Penguin Island (253); and Sinclair Lewis, Arrowsmith (254). Scribner's rejected Cerf's request to reprint Ring Lardner's How to Write Short Stories. It was not until 1941 that the ML was able to include Round Up, a 1929 collection that the ML published under the title The Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner (344).\nCerf pursued other titles that never appeared in the series. Among these were a volume of plays by John Millington Synge, Francis Brett Young's Crescent Moon, Paul Leicester Ford's The Honorable Peter Stirling, Lytton Strachey's Landmarks in French Literature, Lord Charnwood's Abraham Lincoln, O. Henry's The Trimmed Lamp, and William McFee's Captain Macedoine's Daughter.\nWilliam Lyon Phelps at Yale University suggested several titles, including Henry James, The Turn of the Screw and The American; Santayana, Soliloquies in England; Turgenev, A House of Gentlefolk; Bunyan, The Holy War; Swift, Gulliver's Travels; Mill, On Liberty; and Wells, The Wheels of Chance (Phelps to Cerf, 9 February 1927). Of these The Turn of the Screw (189) and Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books (212) were published in the ML in 1930 and 1931. Mill's On Liberty was included in The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill (G45) in 1939 and in The Philosophy of John Stuart Mill (537) in 1961.\nThe literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested John Dos Passos's Manhattan Transfer, but Cerf thought there was not enough demand to justify a ML edition (Cerf to Bernice Baumgarten, Brandt & Brandt, 26 May 1927). The ML later published three other titles by Dos Passos: Three Soldiers (248) in 1932, The 42nd Parallel (307) in 1937, and U.S.A. (G42) in 1939. Brandt & Brandt also suggested W. L. George's Selected Short Stories (10 October 1926). Cerf declined, noting that George was well enough represented in the ML by A Bed of Roses (Cerf to Brandt & Brandt, 17 October 1927).\nKlopfer wanted to add Christopher Morley's novel Where the Blue Begins, but Doubleday, Page had assigned reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap, whose dollar reprints were distributed through a wide variety of retail outlets (Klopfer to Morley, 5 November 1927). In contrast, the ML was sold primarily in bookstores and the book departments of major department stores.\nIsador Feinstein (later widely known as the journalist I. F. Stone) offered to translate La Rochefoucauld's Maxims and Memoirs for the ML (Feinstein to ML, 26 August 1927)."

    "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1928",
    "year": "1928",
    "season": "fall",
    "titles_s_s_d": "Titles sought, suggested, declined\nCerf expressed interest in several titles published by Doubleday, Doran, including works by Joseph Conrad (Victory, Lord Jim, Youth, Chance, or Nigger of the Narcissus), Aldous Huxley (Chrome Yellow or Antic Hay), W. Somerset Maugham (Of Human Bondage, The Moon and Sixpence, or The Trembling of a Leaf), William McFee (Captain Macedoine's Daughter, Command, or Casuals of the Sea), and Horace Walpole (Fortitude). He offered the ML's highest royalty—12 cents a copy—on any of these books (Cerf to Russell Doubleday, 25 April 1928), but Doubleday, Doran was not receptive. The Modern Library was able to include seven of these titles—Victory, Lord Jim, Antic Hay, Of Human Bondage, Moon and Sixpence, Casuals of the Sea, and Fortitude—in the early 1930s as a result of its purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. (See the introductory matter for 1930 for more information on the Sun Dial Library purchase.)\nAnother author Cerf wanted in the ML was Ernest Hemingway. He told Hemingway, \"We are very anxious indeed to add a book of yours to our Modern Library series\" (Cerf to Hemingway, 29 October 1928). The ML was able to secure reprint rights to The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms in the early 1930s; The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway was added to ML Giants in 1942.\nWhen Cerf told Sinclair Lewis that he wanted one if his books in the series, Lewis replied that the decision was up to Harcourt, Brace (Lewis to Cerf, 1928). The ML was able to add Arrowsmith in 1933 and three additional titles by Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s.\nBernice Baumgarten of the literary agency Brandt & Brandt suggested a ML edition of John Dos Passos, Three Soldiers, which had never appeared in a reprint edition (Baumgarten to Cerf, 6 March 1928). Cerf, who had previously declined to reprint Dos Passos's Manhattan Transfer, replied, \"We will not be interested in doing John Dos Passos' 'Three Soldiers' in the Modern Library. I know the book well, and though I think it is an excellent piece of work, I do not feel that Dos Passos quite rates the Modern Library\" (Cerf to Baumgarten, 7 March 1928). Cerf later changed his mind. Three books by Dos Passos were published in the ML in the 1930s: Three Soldiers (1932: 248), The 42nd Parallel (1937: 307), and U.S.A. (1939: G42).\nCerf offered Harcourt, Brace an advance of $1,800 against royalties of 12 cents a copy for reprint rights to Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria, provided the ML could print from Harcourt plates (Cerf to Harrison Smith, 21 April 1928). Harcourt, Brace declined on the grounds that Strachey's Elizabeth and Essex, published that year, would revive interest in the earlier work (Harrison Smith to Cerf, 11 May 1928). Strachey's Eminent Victorians was added to the series in 1933.\nCerf also wanted to include anthologies devoted to American poetry and English poetry. Conrad Aiken's American Poetry, 1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology (169.1), published early in 1928, was compiled for the Modern Library. Cerf sought permission to reprint John Drinkwater's Anthology of English Verse (Houghton Mifflin, 1924), but the publisher rejected the offer (Curtis Brown to Cerf, 13 July 1928).\nKlopfer offered a $4,000 advance against a royalty of 12 cents a copy for James Stephens's Crock of Gold (Klopfer to H. C. Latham, Macmillan, 27 November 1928). Despite subsequent offers, the book never appeared in the ML. Appleton declined Cerf's offer of a $3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage (Cerf to John W. Hiltman, Appleton & Co., 12 December 1928). The ML finally secured reprint rights to Crane's novel fourteen years later.\nE. Clark Stillman suggested a volume of Heinrich Heine's poems for the ML and offered to do the translations (Stillman to ML, 15 June 1928). A reader suggested a volume of poetry by Alfred Noyes. Cerf replied to the latter suggestion, \". . . the idea is a mighty good one, and we shall investigate it at once\" (Cerf to Mrs. R. G. Pattern, 29 October 1928). Nothing came of either suggestion."

    "titles_s_s_d": "Titles sought, suggested, declined\nErich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel All Quiet on the Western Front, with sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929 best-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of $5,000 to $10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in the ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of All Quiet on the Western Front was published by Grosset & Dunlap, which distributed its hardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast, ML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and the book departments of major department stores.\nIn another long shot, Cerf offered a $6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to Lowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his copyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive reprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw's death, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.\nCerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford's novel The Honorable Peter Stirling, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset & Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book (Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley anthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11 December 1929).\nHendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, Tolerance (Boni & Liveright, 1925), noting that it was \"the sort of book to appeal to the free-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor\" (Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press suggested André Tridon's Psychoanalysis, originally published by B. W. Huebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both suggestions were rejected.\nSeveral months after Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (174) appeared in the ML, Duffield & Co. inquired if the ML would be interested in Rostand's later play Chantecler or Paul Verlaines's Poems. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in The History of Mr. Polly by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24 October 1929).\nAlbert Mordell sent his book, The Erotic Motive in Literature (Boni & Liveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no place in the ML because its \"appeal is special, and many statements that would have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today\" (Cerf to Mordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell's book revived in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier Books and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several translations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and the first decade of the twenty-first century."

    "season": "Fall",
    "titles_s_s_d": "Titles sought, suggested, declined\nCerf wanted to include John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga in the Modern Library but realized that Scribner's was unlikely to grant reprint rights. He wrote Maxwell Perkins in 1930, \"I eagerly await hearing of Mr. Scribner's reaction to my suggestion for the Forsyte Saga. I hope that I did not move him to physical violence. I am convinced the idea is not as ridiculous as it very likely appears at first blush\" (Cerf to Perkins, 4 December 1930). Perkins replied that there was no possibility of granting reprint rights (Perkins to Cerf, 4 December 1930). Nine years later Cerf offered an advance of $7,500 to publish The Forsyte Saga as a Giant (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939). Galsworthy's sequence of three novels and two interludes never appeared in the ML.\n Cerf contacted John W. Luce & Co. about rights to a John Millington Synge anthology (Cerf to Mr. Schaff, 23 June 1930). Cerf contacted Longman's for the rights to H. Rider Haggard's She, J. C. Van Dyke's History of Painting, and G. F. Young's history from 44 B.C. to 1453 A.D., East and West through Fifteen Centuries (Cerf to J. Ray Beck, 25 September 1930). The only one of these titles that was ever added to the ML was She—and that was over 25 years later, when Haggard's She & King Solomon's Mines (492) appeared in the ML in 1957.\n James Crowder, the ML's sales representative for the Middle West, suggested Goethe's Faust and The Sayings of Confucius (Crowder to Cerf, 12 April 1930 and 30 September 1930). Faust (200) was published in the ML that fall. The Wisdom of Confucius (312) appeared in the ML in 1938 and became one of the ML's perennial best-selling titles. V. F. Calverton, who edited An Anthology of American Negro Literature (183) for the ML in 1929, offered to edit Tales of E. T. A. Hoffman for the series; Cerf indicated that the book was a possibility in the future (Cerf to Calverton, 10 December 1930).\n The ML decided not to publish Guillaume Apollinaire's La Rome des Borgia after a reader's report judged it pornographic and valueless as history. The reader commented, \"The whole simply stinks of obscenity and abnormality\" (\"Ray\" to Klopfer, 18 February 1930).\n Ferris Greenslet urged Cerf to publish a ML edition of Alain-Fournier's novel The Wanderer (Le Grand Meaulnes), which was originally published in Paris in 1913 and appeared in an English translation published by Houghton Mifflin in 1928, fourteen years after the young author's death in action in the First World War. \"I hope very much that you are going to feel like doing something about THE WANDERER, both because we would like the business and because I personally have a profound interest in extending the reputation of Alain Fournier\" (Greenslet to Cerf, 5 September 1930). Cerf appears to have been skeptical about its sales potential. Roger L. Scaife, who would move from Houghton Mifflin to Little, Brown & Co. a short time later, replied to Cerf: \"You may be right about THE WANDERER. The story took hold of us here so strongly that we thought it a gem that should be preserved and sold year after year. Whether that is possible or not, I do not know. Your judgment is understandably better than mine in this case\" (Scaife to Cerf, 6 October 1930). A new English translation by Frank Davison was published in 1959 under the title The Lost Domain by Oxford University Press in its World's Classics series and reprinted in Penguin Modern Classics as Le Grand Meaulnes in 1966. A third English translation by Robin Buss appeared in Penguin Classics in 2007 under the title The Lost Estate.\n The Marxist poet and novelist Isidor Schneider, who was in charge of advertising at Horace Liveright, Inc., and whose wife, Helen Berlin, had been Cerf and Klopfer's first secretary, recommended Ivan Goncharov's Oblomov for the ML. The Natalie Duddington translation, published by Macmillan the previous year, was the first complete translation in English. Schneider, who later served as literary editor of the New Masses, considered Oblomov one of the world's ten best novels (Schneider to Cerf, 1 April 1930; Schneider Special Manuscript Collection, Columbia University Library). The Duddington translation was published in Everyman's Library in 1932, but Oblomov was never added in the ML."

    "titles_s_s_d": "Titles sought, suggested, declined\nCerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling's Kim in the ML, possibly as a replacement for Soldiers Three which was dropped from the series in 1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran was not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17 February 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. Kim (433) did not appear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams, Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres, the trade edition of which was originally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there was very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced edition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931). Herschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co., asked why Gogol's Dead Souls wasn't in the ML. Klopfer replied, \"Dead Souls isn't in the Modern Library yet because we haven't got around to it. I think you're right; it should be there\" (Brickell to Cerf, undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). Dead Souls (290) was published in the ML in 1936.\n Cerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur Schnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a potential replacement for Schnitzler's novel Bertha Garlan (38) which was discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a collection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title Little Novels in 1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or Cerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology Great German Short Novels and Stories (256), published in April 1933, he included Schnitzler's story \"The Fate of the Baron\" from the Simon and Schuster collection.\n Cerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon's Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was interested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML's format, and he had reservations about Sassoon's popularity in the United States. He eventually declined: \"Maybe something will come along to increase Sassoon's popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will allow us to reopen negotiations on this book\" (Cerf to Coward, 10 February 1931; 9 July 1931).\n R. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested Wolfgang Goethe, a two-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML Giants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied, \"Cheers! What a lousy idea\" (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931; underlining in original).\n When M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion of a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, \"I have the very definite feeling that ed. & Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of the reprints of Mr. Bromfield's books\" (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October 1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar & Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell's Moon-Calf, The Briary-Bush, or Janet March, which were then the property of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, \"I frankly don't think that Dell's old books are read widely enough today to justify their inclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be belonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I wrong?\" (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22 December 1931)."

Nothing came of this initiative. O'Neill became a Random House author the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O'Neill's Nine Plays (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added to the Giants in 1941.\n After repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens's Crock of Gold (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs, the president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the president of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML reprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, \"We are simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a cheap edition we would do it ourselves\" (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).\n Cerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge plays, saying \"If we can't get this from you by peaceable means in the next two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston underworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with lighted matches until you sign on the dotted line\" (Cerf to Schaff, 16 November 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to Kim (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to consider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.\n James Crowder, the ML's sales representative for the Middle West, suggested Edmund Wilson's Axel's Castle: A Study in the Imaginative Literature of 1870–1930, which had been published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with Wilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested adding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed publishing under a new title such as Literary Essays or Essays on Modern Authors. He also asked for an advance of $500 (Wilson to Cerf, 28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays he had considered adding to Axel's Castle into a new book (Wilson to Cerf, 6 November 1933).\n Dale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a one-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm of Albert & Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes comprising Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, would welcome some ready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in 1930, and the firm \"was in major trouble\" by the early 1930s (\"Albert and Charles Boni\" in American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980, p. 57).\n The ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, Swann's Way (1928) and Within a Budding Grove (1930), and would add Guermantes Way in 1933. Cerf thought that Warren's suggestion was an excellent idea except from the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked Warren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris Greenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. \"We have had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire Proust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might be able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that anything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as possible. Something must break in this situation before the summer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining in original). Five months later he indicated, \"I have not given up hopes of buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything develops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you immediately\" (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure Remembrance of Things Past a year or so later. The Random House edition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf described it as \"one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934\" (Cerf, At Random, p. 99).\n Warren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of Proust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but added that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust if the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather's My Antonia, which he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to Warren, 13 September 1943)."

Shaw opposed inexpensive reprints of his works and kept tight control of his copyrights, and it was only after his death in 1950 that the ML was able to include two volumes of his plays. (Shaw temporarily relaxed his opposition to cheap reprints in 1946, when he allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday.) The only work by Shaw that appeared in the ML during his lifetime was his early novel, An Unsocial Socialist (15), which was published before the U.S. extended copyright protection to the works of foreign authors. \nWilla Cather was another author who was ambivalent about inexpensive reprints of her works. She allowed Death Comes to the Archbishop (219) to be included in the Modern Library in 1931 but subsequently asked Knopf not to renew the reprint contract. When Cerf tried to add Cather's My Antonia to the series in 1933 Houghton Mifflin turned him down, probably at Cather's request (Dale Warren to Cerf, 30 October 1933).\nCerf contacted Farrar and Rinehart about including Hervey Allen's Anthony Adverse in ML Giants in 1935 or 1936 (Cerf to John Farrar, 11 August 1933). The historical novel sold 300,000 copies in its first six months and led the fiction best-seller list for two years (19331934). Farrar and Rinehart does not appear to have authorized any reprint edition, not even by Grosset & Dunlap, the leading publisher of reprint editions for the mass market before the advent of paperbacks in 1939. Cerf waited for five years and tried again in 1938 (see 1938 Titles sought, suggested, declined). \nCerf expressed interest in reprinting Ogden Nash's selection from P. G. Wodehouse's works, Nothing but Wodehouse (Doubleday, Doran, 1932), possibly as a Giant—the volume ran to more than 1,000 pages—but Doubleday, Doran was reprinting it in a cheap edition of their own.\nOn a different note, Klopfer asked Max Eastman, whose Marx's Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings (246) had been published in the ML three months earlier, to translate the complete works of Lenin for the ML, noting that it would be \"a perfect follow-up book for the Marx\" and \"would create a great feeling of ill-will in this country, all of which we are very much for.\" Five days later he wrote, \"I am waiting with baited breath to hear the length of the complete works of Lenin, when you would be able to do it, and how much you would want to do a new translation\" (Klopfer to Eastman, 16 February and 21 February 1933). Eastman replied that a volume of Lenin could be any length. He asked for an advance of five hundred dollars and a fee of one cent per word for the translation. He noted, \"Lenin's style is an extraordinary phenomenon—you can feel the locomotive force of the man's will in almost every sentence—and it has never been reproduced in English\" (Eastman to Klopfer, 16 March 1933). Klopfer responded that the ML would like a book of about 100,000 words (Klopfer to Eastman, 17 March 1933).\nEastman received the advance he asked for, but nearly a year went by before he began working on the Lenin book. Cerf wrote in April 1934, \"These are times in which that book could sell marvelously well, and it would be a shame to dilly-dally until somebody beats us to the gun. I beseech you to get to work on it\" (Cerf to Eastman, 4 April 1934). But Eastman made little progress. Other work got in the way, and in August he wrote to Cerf agreeing to an annulment of the contract. Eastman kept the advance, which they agreed would be regarded as an advance for a future project (Eastman to Cerf, 30 August 1934). Cerf and Klopfer gave up the idea of including a Lenin volume in the ML. The only subsequent book of Eastman's to be published by Random House was Love and Revolution: My Journey through an Epoch (1964).\nRobert de Graff, the president of the Doubleday reprint subsidiary Garden City Publishing Co., suggested Clemence Dane's novel Legend for the ML. Dane was the pseudonym of the English novelist, playwright, and screenwriter Winifred Ashton. Cerf replied that he didn't think she would have much of a sale in the ML (de Graff to Cerf, 27 January 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 30 January 1933). Michael S. Mill, a publisher's sales representative, suggested a volume of Anthony Trollope; Cerf replied that the ML would get around to it in the next couple of years (Cerf to Mill, 28 July 1933). Trollope's The Warden & Barchester Towers (292) was added to the ML in 1936.\n Following the publication of Keats and Shelley's Complete Poetical Works (G4) in the new ML Giants series, Cerf and Klopfer considered a Giant devoted to the complete poems of Lord Byron. Robert Linscott of Houghton Mifflin Co. provided sales figures for the firm's Cambridge Edition of The Complete Poetical Works of Lord Byron (1905). Trade sales for the three-year period 1930–32 totaled 1370 copies. Klopfer thanked him and noted, \"I think that that conclusively proves we would not be warranted in making a Giant of a complete Byron\" (Klopfer to Linscott, 13 April 1933). The ML published Byron's Don Juan (420) in 1949 and Selected Poetry (465) in 1954."

Six years earlier Macmillan had turned down an advance of $4,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy—more than the ML paid for all but a select handful of titles. The Crock of Gold was still selling too well in its original American edition for Macmillan to consider a reprint. It never appeared in the ML.\n Little, Brown turned down an offer by Cerf to reprint Mutiny on the Bounty by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Alfred R. McIntyre of Little, Brown indicated that he doubted if anyone would be allowed to publish an inexpensive reprint of the book (Cerf to McIntyre, 20 July 1934; McIntyre to Cerf, 23 July 1934). Cerf was undeterred and made offers for the Bounty trilogy.\n Cerf was also beginning to think about a book on Judaism. He wrote to Arnold Zweig soliciting his suggestions for the series and indicated, \"In particular, I would like to do some history of the Jews in the Modern Library. Have you any suggestions along this line?\" (Cerf to Zweig, 24 July 1934). He repeated his interest two years later in a letter to Harold Guinzburg of Viking Press (Cerf to Guinzburg, 3 March 1936). It took twenty years for this goal to be accomplished. Two books on Judaism compiled for Random House, The Wisdom of Israel, edited by Lewis Browne (1945) and Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People, edited by Leo W. Schwarz (1956) were reprinted in ML Giants in 1956 and 1962.\n Dale Warren of Houghton Mifflin Co. suggested a ML edition of Dorothy Richardson's Pilgrimage, the lengthy novel sequence published in the U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf. He noted that \"the whole stream of consciousness business was really started by Dorothy Richardson\" and added, \"I should think you could buy the rights for a song, and get some sale—although you would of course be making one of those superb gestures for which the Cerf-Klopfer twins are justly noted\" (Warren to Cerf, 30 January 1934). Cerf responded that Klopfer would take up the matter when he was in Boston in September. \"My secret hunch is that Houghton Mifflin have a set of plates of this lemon somewhere on the premises and are trying to pawn them off on unsuspecting and naive young lads like ourselves\" (Cerf to Warren, 22 August 1934).\n Aaron Sussman of Spier & Sussman, the ML's advertising agency, suggested a complete edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes's Breakfast Papers (Sussman to Cerf, 14 November 1934). Cerf replied, \"We steered clear of Holmes and his pals as far as the Modern Library is concerned because we've had such rotten luck with Franklin and Longfellow volumes. It makes me believe that people who want this sort of thing are not inclined to look for it in the Modern Library\" (Cerf to Sussman, 15 November 1934). Sales of The Poems of Longfellow (235) and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Selections from His Other Writings (236) improved in the 1940s and 1950s, when Longfellow ranked in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles and Franklin ranked in the second quarter."

By this time the second and third volumes of Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall's Bounty trilogy—Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island—had been published, and the motion picture version of Mutiny on the Bounty starring Charles Laughton and Clark Gable had been released. Cerf offered a $2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for a ML edition to be published in spring 1937. He wrote, \"We have discovered that by putting the first volumes of the Proust set in the Modern Library, we have boosted the sale of the complete set enormously, and I honestly believe that by making Mutiny on the Bounty available to a new audience, you would find the sales of the trilogy increased in exactly the same manner\" (Cerf to Alfred McIntyre, Little, Brown, 5 October 1936). Little, Brown was not persuaded.\n Another popular book for which the ML was unable to get reprint rights was Ralph Roeder's Man of the Renaissance, which had been published by Viking Press in 1933 (Haas to Marshall Best, Viking Press, 14 September 1936).\n Alfred McIntyre of Little, Brown suggested a ML edition of Louis-Ferdinand Céline's Journey to the End of Night (McIntyre to Cerf, 10 February 1936), but the Little, Brown edition was nearly two inches taller than the ML's format and the original plates could not have been used. Cerf responded, \"Under ordinary circumstances, I would be strongly inclined to add the book to the regular Modern Library series because I think it is good enough for it, but the plate difficulty seems insurmountable\" (Cerf to McIntyre, 18 March 1936). It would have been possible to photograph the Little, Brown edition, reduce the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography—as New Directions did for at least some paperback printings of Journey to the End of Night three or four decades later—but in the 1930s offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing, the quality was not as good, and the ML resorted to it reluctantly. Céline's novel never appeared in the ML.\n Ross G. Baker of Bobbs-Merrill suggested Robert Nathan's Woodcutter's House, which the firm had published in 1927. Cerf replied, \"We discussed this book several times before . . . and decided that it is not sufficiently popular to warrant its inclusion in the series, despite its obvious merit. It is true that Knopf is doing a great deal of ballyhoo for Nathan these days, but unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be doing very much for his older titles\" (Cerf to Baker, 4 August 1936).\n Raymond Healy, who had been hired in 1935 as the ML's sales representative on the West Coast, suggested that the ML publish a cookbook. Cerf replied, \"We have thought of putting a cookbook in the Modern Library, but decided that we had better stick more to the literary line . . . and let people like Blue Ribbon and Star Dollar do cookbooks and the like\" (Cerf to Healy, 3 April 1936; underlining in original). Around the same time Healy reported that \"the trade is now asking us for an Emerson in the Modern Library. Personally, I think the old Gent was a stick in the mud but I relay the request to you anyhow\" (Healy to Cerf, 6 April 1936).

He wrote Doubleday, Doran about Kenneth Roberts's Arundel, which dealt with Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec during the Revolutionary War. He noted that he understood that Roberts was not keen about having his books in reprint editions but argued that the ML should \"be considered in a rather different category than the ordinary reprint. We have got one book or more by almost every important American novelist in the series now\" (Cerf to Malcolm Johnson, Doubleday, Doran, 12 May 1938). Cerf then wrote to Roberts himself, offering an advance of $1,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated, \"In these days and times, a $1500.00 advance is a heavy one, but I feel so confident that ARUNDEL would sell like blazes in the Modern Library series that I think the advance would be earned in far less than the usual time and that, therefore, the book would sell in the Modern Library series very steadily for many years to come\" (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 May 1938). Doubleday, Doran agreed to Cerf's terms, but Roberts was unconvinced. He indicated that he was not certain that Arundel should be available in a cheap edition, and subsequently wrote that he had decided \"to wait a while longer before allowing a cheap edition of any of my books\" (Roberts to Cerf, 21 November 1938). \n Shortly thereafter Cerf wrote Hervey Allen about including his historical novel Anthony Adverse in ML Giants (Cerf to Hervey Allen, 6 December 1938). He first expressed interest in Anthony Adverse five years earlier, shortly after it was published (see 1933 Titles sought, suggested, declined). Anthony Adverse sold 300,000 copies in its first six months and led the fiction bestseller lists in 1933 and 1934. Nothing came of Cerf's initiative.

Mann's novel had appeared in the regular ML in 1932, but Knopf declined to renew the five-year reprint contract and the ML edition had been out of print since May 1938. Knopf rejected Cerf's offer. Several subsequent reprint offers by the ML were also unsuccessful. The Magic Mountain was not restored to the regular ML until 1992, after Random House's \"relaunch\" of the series. By this time Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., had been a division of Random House for 32 years.\n Cerf inquired about the possibility of doing a volume by Edna St. Vincent Millay in the ML (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939). Macmillan rejected an offer for the one-volume edition of Sir James George Frazier's The Golden Bough, originally published in 1922, noting that it still netted the firm between $1,300 and $1,800 a year (George P. Brett, Macmillan, to Cerf, 7 August 1939). Cerf expressed interest in reprinting John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga (published in one volume by Scribner's in 1925) as a Giant, offering an advance of $7,500 (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939), but Scribner's had no interest in authorizing a reprint edition.\nCerf also expressed interest in including A. L. Morton, A People's History of England in ML Giants (Cerf to Morton, 9 November 1939), but the book never appeared in the series. The American edition had been published by Random House the previous year. The original edition was published in Britain by Victor Gollancz and had been the May 1938 main selection of Gollancz's Left Book Club.\n Clifford Odets suggested a collection of the best eight, ten, or twelve American plays ever written (Odets to Cerf, 20 September 1939). Howard Mumford Jones suggested a volume by Anthony Trollope (Jones to Cerf, 8 June 1938), but the ML had published The Warden & Barchester Towers (292) three years earlier. It would be eight years before Trollope's Eustace Diamonds (399) was added. John Farrar suggested Henry Seidel Canby's Age of Confidence, which Farrar & Rinehart had published five years earlier.\n Cerf considered adding Gustavus Myers's History of the Supreme Court of the United States but decided that it did not quite fit into the Modern Library list (Cerf to Kerr & Co., 7 November 1939).\n Gertrude Stein urged Cerf to add her two autobiographical works, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1933) and Everybody's Autobiography (Random House, 1937) to the ML (Stein to Cerf, undated). Cerf replied that he would love to see them as a Giant but that \"public demand for these books is practically non-existent\" (Cerf to Stein, 8 August 1939). Stein's Three Lives (261) had been published in the ML in 1933, but sales were disappointing and it was discontinued at the end of 1940. It would be twenty-four years before another book by Stein appeared in the regular ML. The Selected Writings of Gertrude Stein (547) was published in 1963, followed by The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (623) in 1980. However, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas was reprinted in Random House's quality paperback series, Modern Library Paperbacks, in fall 1955. After Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, the Knopf series Vintage Books became the quality paperback imprint for the combined firm, and later paperback printings of The Autobiography of Alice B.

Cerf tried again to get Rudyard Kipling's Kim for the ML, offering an advance of $2,000 against 10 cents a copy royalties for reprint rights (Cerf to Van Cartmell, Doubleday, Doran, 27 February 1940). It would be another decade before the ML secured reprint rights to Kipling's novel. Cerf also sought Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's The Yearling, which was published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1938, became the year's best-selling novel, and won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. He indicated that he wanted to publish it in 1942 (Cerf to Max Perkins, 11 April 1940). Scribner's did not grant reprint rights to the ML until 1946.

The ML never secured reprint rights. In 1953 Scribner's served notice that it was withdrawing all three Hemingway titles in the ML—The Sun Also Rises (190), A Farewell to Arms (237), and The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway (G59)—in order to publish their own reprint editions in all English-speaking markets in North America.\n Conrad Aiken repeated his suggestion for a ML edition of his first novel, Blue Voyage, published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1927 (Aiken to Cerf, 19 May 1941).

Cerf tried to secure reprint rights to Hitler's Mein Kampf for the ML, but Houghton Mifflin, the original American publisher, was bringing out a new edition of their own (Cerf to Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 4 November 1942; Linscott to Cerf, 6 November 1942).\n Shortly after Random House published The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne & Complete Poetry of William Blake (RH, 1941; ML Giant, 1946) W. H. Auden suggested a ML volume of poetry by Andrew Marvell, George Herbert, and Henry Vaughan. Commins responded, \"You have probably guessed that the Donne-Blake book has most of its sales in colleges where both poets are considered in every course on English literature. This does not apply to Marvell, Herbert or Vaughan . . . such a book would not achieve sufficient sales to cover the very high cost of manufacturing it\" (Commins to Auden, 14 January 1942).\n Henry Hoyns, a veteran employee of Harper & Bros. who had recently been appointed president of the firm, suggested Louis Adamic's Grandsons, Evelyn Eaton's Quietly My Captain Waits, André Maurois's Chateaubriand, and Frederic Prokosch's The Seven Who Fled for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 19 January 1942), but none of these Harper titles was appropriate for the series. Hoyns subsequently suggested a ML edition of Hesketh Pearson's biography, Gilbert and Sullivan (Harper, 1935), but Cerf thought it would more appropriate for the Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday imprint that specialized in reprint editions (Cerf to Hoyns, 15 September 1942).\n Harry E. Maule, a Random House editor, suggested a ML edition of Sinclair Lewis's Main Street (Maule to Cerf, 12 March 1942), but Lewis's Babbitt (348) had been added to the series a month before. Lewis himself suggested a ML volume of the poetry of Carl Sandberg, Vachel Lindsay, and Edgar Lee Masters, but Cerf indicated that it might be impossible to obtain reprint rights (Cerf to Sinclair Lewis, 14 September, 1942).\n Klopfer rejected a suggestion by Marshall Best of Viking Press for a ML edition of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, stating \"the book is dated\" (Klopfer to Best, 31 March 1942). George Duplaix suggested The True History of the Conquest of Mexico by Bernal Díaz del Castillo. Max Lerner suggested Maxim Gorky's autobiographical trilogy, My Childhood, In the World, and My Universities, with an introduction by his former wife, Anita Marburg (Lerner to Commins, 1 December 1942). \n Cerf made the first of several attempts to secure reprint rights to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. It would be another fourteen years before Huxley's novel appeared in the series. Cerf wanted to add Antoine de Saint-Exupery's Wind, Sand and Stars to the ML in late 1942 or early 1943 (Cerf to Eugene Reynal, 6 February 1942), but reprint rights do not appear to have been available. Other works sought for the ML that never appeared in the series included Archibald MacLeish's selected poems and James Henry Breasted's Conquest of Civilization (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, 31 July 1942)."

Ginn was concerned that a 95-cent ML edition would hurt sales of Ancient Times in college towns (Rose to Cerf, 5 July 1946). Klopfer rejected a suggestion to include H. G.

The ML also decided against Sigmund Freud's Leonardo da Vinci (Dodd, Mead, 1932), which was not included in The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (Giant, 1938). A. A. Brill, who had translated Leonardo da Vinci and edited the Giant, sent a copy to Commins for consideration, indicating that Dodd, Mead was willing to return all rights to the book (A. A. Brill to Commins, 4 October 1946). The length of Leonardo da Vinci—just 130 pages—was a problem.

Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot's Middlemarch for ML College Editions and offered to write an introduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six months later: \"You will find all the contemporary English critics like Leavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf's opinion about Middlemarch as the great novel of the 19th Century. It is back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will be a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and World's Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by the time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who have anticipated the change in critical estimate\" (Haight to Stein, 15 June 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML's new paperback series, Modern Library College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published at the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, \"There are some titles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far are assured top sellers, while Middlemarch, although rated high critically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as, say, Anna Karenina. . . . The status of Middlemarch on our list here is simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at least break even on Middlemarch we will include it\" (Stein to Haight, 20 June 1950). Middlemarch (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984.\n Jess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph Conrad's Nostromo and The Nigger of the Narcissus, Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy, George Eliot's Adam Bede, Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield, three works by Henry James (Daisy Miller, The American, and The Golden Bowl), Franz Kafka's The Castle, Jack London's Call of the Wild, Lucretius's On the Nature of Things, Frank Norris's The Pit, Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis, Ignazio Silone's Bread and Wine, Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queen, Henri Stendhal's Charterhouse of Parma, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome, Owen Wister's The Virginian, and Emile Zola's Germinal (Stein to Cerf, 10 October 1950). The following titles on Stein's list were published in the regular series or ML Giants: Conrad, Nostromo (1951: 438); Dreiser, An American Tragedy (1950: G89); Goldsmith, Vicar of Wakefield and Other Writings (1955: 476); Kafka, The Castle (1969: 610); and Spenser, Selected Poetry (1964: G104). Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was available as part of a ML Giant that included Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as a volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein's list were former ML titles that had been discontinued: James, Daisy Miller; An International Episode (1918: 60) and Stendhal, Charterhouse of Parma (1937: 298).\n Somerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James's Principles of Psychologyy (Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume of Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to Stein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been enthusiastic about the proposal."

He expressed interest in Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets. He asked William Barnett and Morton White to edit a book on modern philosophy for ML Giants, indicating that it could sell 15,000–20,000 copies a year (Epstein to White, 24 February 1959). Mark Van Doren, who had edited The Poetry of John Dryden (Harcourt, Brace & Howe, 1920) nearly forty years earlier, declined an invitation to edit a collection of Dryden's works for the ML (Van Doren to Epstein, 20 May 1959). Epstein asked William Arrowsmith, whose translation of Petronius, Satyricon (University of Michigan Press, 1959) had recently appeared, to translate Aristophanes for the ML, indicating that he thought it would earn annual royalties between $500 and $1,000 (Epstein to Arrowsmith, 23 October 1959). He invited F. W. Dupee to translate a selection of the works of the Marquis de Sade for the ML; as a second choice he expressed interest in a translation of Flaubert's Sentimental Education (Epstein to Dupee, 17 November 1959).\n Cerf wanted to include the one-volume edition of James George Frazer's The Golden Bough (Macmillan, 1922) in ML Giants and asked C. Edgar Phreaner Jr. to seek rights (Phreaner to Cerf, 27 July 1959). He offered Little, Brown an advance of $6,000 for Edith Hamilton, Mythology, originally published in 1942 (Cerf to Arthur Thornhill, 26 October 1959), and he asked Professor William Alfred of Harvard University about translations for a volume of Middle English literature for the ML, saying \"It would be a good idea, I think, for the Modern Library to include an Anthology of this type\" (Cerf to Alfred, 17 November 1959). None of these works were added to the ML.\n Several of Epstein's suggestions resulted in additions to the series: A Kierkegaard Anthology (1959: 518), Dickens, Our Mutual Friend (1960: 524), and the Bernard Guilbert Guerney translation of Turgenev, Fathers and Sons (1917: 20.2a), which replaced the Constance Garnett translation in the ML in 1961 (Epstein to Klopfer, 12 January 1959). Other titles suggested by Epstein included Goodspeed's translation of The Apocrypha (1962: 541), The Space Handbook (ML Paperbacks, November 1959), and Bernard Malamud's The Magic Barrel (ML Paperbacks, April 1960).\n Epstein offered a $500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights to the William Arrowsmith translation of Petronius, Satyricon (University of Michigan Press, 1959) but withdrew the offer when he discovered that a paperback edition would be published by Mentor Books (Epstein to Fred D. Wieck, 30 November 1959). An Anthology of Russian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak, edited by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, was considered for the ML but was published in 1960 as a Random House trade book. Other titles considered included E. M. W. Tillyard, The Elizabethan World Picture; Jacob Bronowski, The Common Sense of Science; and Five Plays of Eugene O'Neill. A Documentary History of Communism, edited by Robert V. Daniels, was considered for the ML but was postponed (Minutes of ML Meeting, 5 February 1959); it ended up being published in two volumes in Vintage Books.\n Epstein wanted to strengthen the ML's offerings of poetry. He suggested volumes devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer, the Cavalier Poets (Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, and Richard Lovelace) and collections of the poetry of Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Samuel Johnson, Christopher Smart, W. S. Landor, Robert Burns, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also suggested publishing several longer poems as separate ML volumes, including Wordsworth's The Prelude, Browning's The Ring and the Book, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queen, and the narrative poems of William Butler Yeats (Epstein to Andrew Chiappe, 6 February 1959). None of these proposals came to fruition.\n Charles Singleton, professor of humanities studies at Johns Hopkins University, signed a contract to prepare a new translation of Dante's Divine Comedy for the ML, for which he received a $3,000 advance against royalties of 6½ percent of the retail price. In the end the project took longer than expected and expanded beyond the single volume that the ML anticipated. Singleton's edition was published in six volumes by Princeton University Press between 1970 and 1975. Each of the three parts—Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso—consisted of a volume containing the Italian text and Singleton's translation and a volume of commentary by Singleton.\n Epstein was also looking for new translations of several works that were already in the ML. The Ennis Rees translations of Homer's Iliad (1929: 186.2) and Odyssey (1929: 187.2), published by Random House in 1960 and 1963, replaced the 19th-century translations of Lang, Leaf and Myers and Butcher and Lang in the ML between 1962 and 1964. The Samuel Putnam translation of Cervantes, Don Quixote, published by Viking Press in two volumes in 1949, replaced the Ozell revision of the Motteux translation in 1964 in the regular ML and ML Giants.\n Other works that Epstein wanted to include in the ML were Hindu, Buddhist, and Confucian Traditions by Theodore de Bary, Japanese Plays by Donald Keene, and the forthcoming edition of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, translated with commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (Bollingen Foundation, 1964). Also being sought were new translations of Homer's Odyssey and Iliad and the University of Chicago's translations of Greek Drama (Epstein to Cerf, 3 September 1959). The ML reprinted the Chicago edition of The Complete Greek Tragedies in seven volumes between 1960 and 1963.\n Andrew Chiappe suggested Livy's Hannibal's Campaign, Tolstoy's Essays, Balzac's Lost Illusions, and Terence's Comedies (Chiappe, November 1959). Epstein intended to add Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, for which he paid William G. Miller $500 for editing work (Epstein to Miller 9 November 1959). Of these only Tolstoy, Selected Essays (1964: 564) and Balzac, Lost Illusions (1967: G109) appeared in the ML.\n Klopfer asked Macmillan for reprint rights to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind for ML Giants. Macmillan considered the offer seriously but Bruce Brett, the president of the firm, concluded that \"this is not the time for it\" (Brett to Klopfer, 15 December 1959).\n John Clive, whose Macaulay: The Shaping of a Historian would be published by Knopf in 1973, suggested a ML selection of Macaulay's works. Epstein declined the proposal, noting that ML titles had to sell \"a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 copies a year for a considerable period, which means that it has to be assigned to undergraduates in fairly substantial numbers\" (Epstein to Clive, 15 September 1959)."
