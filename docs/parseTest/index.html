    "title": "MODERN LIBRARY 1925",
    "year": "1925",
    "general": "The Modern Library series was founded in May 1917 by Boni & Liveright, a new publishing firm that was created to publish the Modern Library. The series was conceived by Albert Boni, a twenty-five year old Greenwich Village bookseller and occasional publisher. The Modern Library was founded at a time when the United Stated was undergoing an intense cultural upheaval. Boni was in the thick of the cultural upheaval. His Washington Square Bookshop was a favorite gathering place for Village artists and intellectuals. He was one of the founders of the Washington Square Players. As publisher of The Glebe, a little magazine edited by Alfred Kreymborg, he was already active in promoting translations of modern European writers—much to the dismay of Kreymborg, who was interested mainly in discovering and nurturing unknown Americans. \nIn May 1925, less than two years after joining Boni & Liveright as vice-president president, Bennett A. Cerf negotiated an agreement to buy the Modern Library from Horace Liveright. He had dreamed of having his own firm from the time he entered publishing, and Liveright, as usual, needed money. The firm had not had a best seller since 1923, Liveright was losing money in the stock market, he was beginning to moonlight as a Broadway producer, and he wanted a divorce. As part of the separation agreement he had to repay large sums that he had borrowed from his wife and father-in-law. Tom Dardis, Liveright's latest biographer, indicates that the debts to his wife and father-in-law had been repaid at this point and speculates that his primary reason for selling the Modern Library was \"the huge amounts he required to continue producing plays on Broadway\" (Dardis, Firebrand: The Life of Horace Liveright, p. 228).\nIn his unpublished autobiography, written shortly before his death, Liveright indicates that the meeting at which the sale of the Modern Library was agreed to was preceded by several weeks of conversations and meetings with friends and advisers and with Cerf and his advisers (Autobiography, insert y, p. 2. Komroff Papers, Columbia University Library). Cerf recalls the decision as having been proposed and settled on May 19. Liveright, who took Cerf to a farewell luncheon to celebrate Cerf's departure that evening for his first trip to Europe, complained about financial pressures. Cerf repeated an offer he had made before to buy the Modern Library. This time, instead of brushing him off, Liveright asked what he would pay for it, and they continued to negotiate at the office that afternoon. By the end of the afternoon a deal had been struck (Cerf, At Random, pp. 44–46).\nCerf and Liveright agreed to a selling price of $200,000. Included in that sum was the $25,000 that Cerf had lent Liveright when he joined the firm and an additional $25,000 he lent him subsequently. Cerf was getting the Modern Library for an additional payment of $150,000. The money was due after Cerf's return from Europe, with Cerf to assume control of the series on August 1st.\nThat evening Cerf sailed on the Aquitania for his first trip to Europe. That night he wrote in his diary: \n\nAnd so I'm off for bed after the most eventful day of my life. I bought the Modern Library from Boni & Liveright after a whirlwind conference—a step that will alter my entire career (Cerf, Diary, 20 May 1925, Bennet Cerf Papers, Columbia University Library).\nHe celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday on his last full day at sea before arriving at Southampton on May 26th.\nMany details of the purchase remained to be settled. Cerf's plans called for Donald S. Klopfer to put up $100,000 and go in with him as equal partner, but Klopfer was not certain at the time Cerf sailed that he would be able to raise the money. The two men had met during the autumn of 1918 at Columbia University, when Cerf was a senior and Klopfer was a freshman. Klopfer transferred to Williams College in the middle of his freshman year, but he and Cerf remained friends. Cerf recalled in his autobiography that after attending a concert at Carnegie Hall they walked \"all the way around Central Park – over to Fifth Avenue up to 110th Street, over to Central Park West and down to 59th Street, just talking. And when we finished that walk, we were friends for life\" (Cerf, At Random, pp. 24–25).\nKlopfer left college after his sophomore year to work for his stepfather, who held a one-sixth interest in United Diamond Works, a diamond cutting and polishing factory in Newark, New Jersey. His stepfather had since died, leaving Klopfer his interest in the closely held firm. The other owners agreed to buy Klopfer's interest for 80 percent of the book value, giving him the $100,000 he needed (Klopfer, interview with GBN, 5 July 1978), and he had the money by the time Cerf returned from Europe.\nThat gave Cerf and Klopfer enough money to buy the Modern Library, but they lacked working capital to meet operating expenses. At this point Cerf's uncle, Herbert Wise, came to their aid, lending them 500 shares of Norfolk and Western railroad stock, which was then selling for about $130 a share. They used the stock as collateral for a $50,000 bank loan. They returned the stock to Wise a hundred shares at a time and were able to pay off the entire loan within two years.\nOne final hitch came up before the sale of the Modern Library was completed. At the last minute Liveright insisted that Cerf and Klopfer give him a contract as an adviser for five years at five thousand dollars a year. \"His advice was the last thing we needed,\" Cerf recalled, \"but he said if we didn't agree to it, the deal was off. So we had to give in\" (Cerf, At Random, p. 54). Shortly after they took over the series they offered Liveright a lump payment of fifteen thousand dollars to cancel the agreement, and Liveright accepted. So the total cost of the Modern Library came to $215,000.\nOwnership of the Modern Library was transferred to Cerf and Klopfer on 1 August 1925. They acquired the name and good will of the series, reprint rights to copyrighted titles included in it, the plates owned by Boni & Liveright, and the stock of books on hand, most of which were unbound. The value of the plates and books was estimated at $75,000 (Columbia Auditors, C.P.A. to Henry Hoyns, Harper and Bros., 22 July 1925). \nThe new company was incorporated as The Modern Library, Inc., with Cerf as President and Klopfer as Vice-President. Gustave Cerf (Cerf's father), who worked on a part-time basis until his death in 1941, was listed as Secretary and Treasurer. They were joined by two Boni & Liveright employees: Emanuel Harper, who soon became the firm's treasurer, and Helen Berlin, who was Cerf and Klopfer's secretary from 1925 until 1928. The Modern Library, Inc. opened for business in a two-room office on the ninth floor of 71 West 45th Street. Cerf and Klopfer worked at desks facing each other. After moving to larger quarters they continued to share an office and work at facing desks until Klopfer accepted a commission in the Air Force in May 1942. They shared a secretary until Cerf's death in 1971.\nThe sale of the Modern Library was announced in the New York Times on 13 July 1925. The following advertisement appeared in Publishers' Weekly (1 August 1925, p. 423; italics in original):\n\nNews!\nTHE MODERN LIBRARY HAS CHANGED HANDS!\n ON AUGUST FIRST, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, a new organization will assume publication and distribution of the MODERN LIBRARY.\n Its name will be the MODERN LIBRARY, Incorporated.\n Its address will be 71 West 45th Street, New York City.\n Its sole endeavor will be the further development and exploitation of a series that has grown in eight years to embrace 110 titles, and to be known wherever English books are read.\n The format and general character of THE MODERN LIBRARY books will be absolutely unchanged.\n The American bookseller can count on the generous cooperation of an experienced and strongly fortified organization with no general publications over which to concern itself, devoting its entire energies to one project – the growth of the MODERN LIBRARY."

    "year": "1926",
    "general": "Cerf and Klopfer did not discontinue any Modern Library titles in 1926 and added twelve new titles to the series, bringing the total number of active titles to 125. One of the additions was Beerbohm, Zuleika Dobson, which had been in the Boni & Liveright series between 1918 and 1922. Zuleika Dobson may have been withdrawn from the series by Dodd, Mead & Co., which made a new printing of its own in 1924. Two years later Cerf and Klopfer were able to restore it to the series. All families of printings of Zuleika Dobson in the ML, including those between 1926 and 1970 (36cd), are described in the chapter for 1918."

    "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1927",
    "year": "1927",
    "general": "Cerf and Klopfer created Random House as a subsidiary of the Modern Library, Inc., to create and distribute \"books of typographic excellence in America\" (announcement on Random House letterhead with Rockwell Kent's newly designed device of a ramshackle house, 24 January 1927). The letter to booksellers appears to be the first time Kent's device was used. The second appearance was probably Random House's \"Announcement Number One\" in February 1927 of seven limited editions from Nonesuch Press (reproduced in Cerf, At Random, p. 66). The officers of the new venture were Cerf, Klopfer, and Elmer Adler of the Pynson Printers. Random House became the exclusive American distributor for books published by Francis Meynell's Nonesuch Press and the Golden Cockerel Press, the most important English private presses. \nThe first book published under the Random House imprint was a limited edition of Voltaire's Candide with illustrations by Rockwell Kent. It was printed by Elmer Adler at his Pynson Printers and published in spring 1928. The colophon states: \"Of this first book with imprint of Random House 1470 numbered copies are printed on all rag French paper and 95 coloured in the studio by the artist. Hand set in type designed by Lucien Bernhard, paragraph designs by Rockwell Kent; both cast by the Bauersche Giesserei, Frankfort. The composition and press work completed by the Pynson Printers in the month of April MCMXXVIII . . . New York.\" Rockwell Kent's signature appeared between the date and the place of publication.\nThe market for fine limited editions collapsed after the 1929 stock market crash, and Random House gradually turned toward trade publishing.\nTwo years after Cerf bought the ML from Horace Liveright he approached Liveright about buying the rest of the firm. Richard Simon, a former Boni & Liveright vice-president who co-founded Simon and Schuster in January 1924, also appears to have tried to buy Boni & Liveright around the same time. Liveright wrote to his second cousin and close friend Alfred Wallerstein (3 August 1927):\n\nSince I saw you last, Bennett Cerf and Dick Simon asked me to put a price on the business, Bennett having offered me $250,000 and I believe that he could be gotten to pay $300,000. I wrestled with my soul a good deal and have come to the definite conclusion that publishing is a pretty fine vocation, that there is lots of chance of doing good in it, and that with proper management, while we won't make a fortune, I should have a good steady safe income here. I am getting no younger and if I cut adrift from publishing, it might not have a good spiritual effect on my life. I've let everyone around the office know this and I'll see that the publishing world at large knows it too. I'm thinking pretty much now in publishing terms, although, of course, the theatre does occupy some of my time and thoughts (Horace Liveright Papers, University of Pennsylvania Library, box 19, Wallerstein family folder).",

    "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1930",
    "year": "1930",
    "general": "The Modern Library's purchase of the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in hard-cover reprints, was announced on 4 April. The Sun Dial Library had been in existence since 1923 and was a reprint series of modern literary works similar in format and scope to the Modern Library. In 1930 it included fifty-three titles that sold for one dollar a copy. The Sun Dial Library had never been a strong rival, but it was the only American series that competed with the Modern Library to any extent and Cerf regarded it as potentially dangerous (Cerf to James L. Crowder, 2 April 1930). \nThe purchase of the Sun Dial Library gave the Modern Library access to a number of titles that Cerf and Klopfer had tried to secure from Doubleday in the past. The series included major works by Joseph Conrad, Aldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, William McFee, and Christopher Morley, all of whom were Doubleday authors. Other desirable titles in the series included Katherine Mansfield's Garden Party, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and H. G. Wells's Tono-Bungay.\nAs part of the agreement the Modern Library secured reprint rights to four Doubleday titles—Arnold Bennett's Old Wives' Tale, Aldous Huxley's Point Counter Point, W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage, and Horace Walpole's Fortitude—that were not part of the Sun Dial Library. Cerf and Klopfer had been trying to secure reprint rights to these titles for several years. The Modern Library agreed to pay Doubleday, Doran royalties of 12 cents a copy for these four titles—two cents more than Cerf and Klopfer were then paying for any other book in the ML with the exception of Dreiser's Twelve Men (159). The four titles were added to the Modern Library between September 1930 and January 1931.\n Eleven of the 53 titles in the Sun Dial Library were added to the ML between 1931 and 1937: Conrad, Lord Jim (210); Mansfield, The Garden Party (214); Morley, Parnassus on Wheels (213); McFee, Casuals of the Sea (223); Wells, Tono-Bungay (225); Stoker, Dracula (231); Conrad, Victory (238); Dos Passos, Three Soldiers (248); Huxley, Antic Hay (233); Maugham, Moon and Sixpence (283); and Collins, The Moonstone (G31). All of these except The Moonstone appear to have been protected by copyright and could not have been included in the ML without the permission of Doubleday, Doran.\n The purchase of the Sun Dial Library was a straight cash transaction. The Modern Library acquired the entire stock of Sun Dial Library books, about 87,000 volumes, and got the right for five years to add any title from the series for which Doubleday, Doran controlled the copyright. No plates were involved since Garden City Publishing Co., like other reprint publishers, printed from the original publishers' plates. The total cost was just under $25,000. This represented the exact manufacturing cost of each volume, a royalty of ten cents a copy, and an additional payment of $5,000.\nThe books were transferred to the Modern Library's warehouse at the Wolff Bindery in New York. Cerf estimated that no more than half of the books could be sold at full price. Cerf and Klopfer hoped at first to sell enough books at the regular price to enable them to remainder the rest at the end of the year and still break even (Cerf to Crowder, 10 April 1930). Macy's and Bloomingdale's, the big New York department stores, placed orders for one thousand copies each and disposed of them at sale prices of about 69 cents a copy. By June the stock was down to 60,000 copies. At that time Klopfer indicated that they had abandoned the idea of remaindering the books (Klopfer to G. E. Rogers, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 3 June 1930). By early 1931 Sun Dial Library books were being offered at discounts ranging from 42 percent on fifty copies to 55 percent on a thousand or more. Salesmen were urged to try to get one big account in each city to take a large selection at these discounts, but Cerf asked them not to press booksellers too hard (Cerf to Carl J. Smalley, 15 January 1931 and 11 June 1931).\nOther ways were found to dispose of the weakest titles. Many of them were bartered for Modern Library advertising in college newspapers, and several booksellers agreed to accept Sun Dial Library books as the Modern Library's contribution toward cooperative advertising. By September 1933 the Sun Dial Library stock was almost gone.\nCerf commented to the ML's senior sales representative, \"Considering the general depression, our Modern Library sales seem to be holding up wonderfully. The new picture jackets help, and the Fall additions should cause general satisfaction, I believe\" (Cerf to Crowder, 11 July 1930).\nThe ML ordered new typesettings and plates for three of its most popular titles: Maugham, Of Human Bondage (199), Bennett, Old Wives Tale (207), and Stoker, Dracula (231).\nErnest Hemingway paid tribute to the ML's format in December 1930. He had shattered his arm in a serious car accident in early November and was recuperating in Key West after spending seven weeks in a Billings, Montana hospital. In a letter to Cerf typed by his wife Pauline he gratefully described Modern Library books as \"the proper size for one-handed reading\" (Hemingway to Cerf, 26 December 1930).",
    "numberTitles": "Nineteen titles were added and four were discontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 182. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML's practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall lists. Fall 1930 jackets also list Merejkowski,\nPeter and Alexis (227), which was originally announced for August 1930 but was delayed until December 1931.",

    "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1931",
    "general": "It took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest levels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales fluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears to have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream books sold for less than the ML's retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML sales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for September 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library's history up to that time (Cerf, \"The Modern Library and the Price of Books,\" PW, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; PW, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).\n Modern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to include works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to accommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in fall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, War and Peace (G1), Boswell, Life of Samuel Johnson (G2), and Hugo, Les Misérables (G3). The Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm) with hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the volumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for one dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were ideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate success.\n In contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and Klopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint collapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers for their collections. One collector, whose library included a large number of Kelmscott Press books, including The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden Cockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically everything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales representatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was asked for suggestions, he could only reply, \"I don't know a soul who wants to buy a lot of press books today\" (Carl Smalley to Cerf and Klopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933 Random House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of the original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells's Time Machine designed by W. A. Dwiggins ($12.50 list) was available for $2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne ($42.00 list) was reduced to $10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides ($85.00 list) was $15.00.\n Cerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under the Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for \"specials\" intended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML plates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on good quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt tops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of $2.50. The venture was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title were printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in major cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did not do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that they would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 \"was one of those years when even $2.50 was a high priced book\" (Carl Smalley to Cerf, 18 August 1932).\n RH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but the books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML plates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50 cents.",

    "general": "Elmer Adler, who had been a director of Random House since the imprint was created in 1927 to distribute and publish fine limited editions, resigned in 1932. Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine printing business, Pynson Printers, and to The Colophon, the bibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random House was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library, Inc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933, following the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing.\nML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide exceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes published in 1932 sold for $1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages per volume.\n The ML published a full-page ad in Publishers' Weekly that lampooned the publishing industry adage, \"You can't sell books like soap.\" Adapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed \"They Float!\" and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with five Modern Library books—Of Human Bondage, Swann's Way, The Magic Mountain, Droll Stories, and Sanctuary—floating on the surface of the water (PW, 14 May 1932, p. 2015).",
    "numberTitles": "Twenty-four titles were added and fifteen were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 207. Six of the discontinued titles (two by Maupassant and four by Wilde) were repackaged as three volumes to offer better value. Chekhov, Rothschild's Fiddle and Other Stories, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more comprehensive collection, The Stories of Anton Tchekov, edited by Robert Linscott). Three new titles in ML Giants, including Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in two volumes, brought the number of Giants to six titles in seven volumes. Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was expanded to three volumes in 1946."

    "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1933",
    "year": "1933",
    "general": "Publishers' Weekly reported that the Modern Library's best-selling books for 1933 showed \"a distinct change in the trend of interest of readers. For the first time in years none of the so-called sex titles, like 'Droll Stories' or 'The Decameron,' was on the list. Most interesting was the popularity of 'Selected Writings of Karl Marx,' edited by Max Eastman, which sold for months like a new novel and is still selling at the rate of 200 copies a week.\" The ten best sellers for the year were: Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms, Faulkner, Sanctuary, Marx, Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings, Lawrence, Sons and Lovers, Maugham, Of Human Bondage, Mann, The Magic Mountain, Merejkowski, The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci, Dostoyevsky, The Brothers Karamazov, Cather, Death Comes for the Archbishop, and Rostand, Cyrano de Bergerac (\"Modern Library Best Sellers,\" PW, 13 January 1934, p. 148).\n Cerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing in 1933 after the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The firm had been through many changes since Albert Boni's departure in July 1918. The name Boni & Liveright was used until fall 1928, three years after Cerf and Klopfer's purchase of the Modern Library deprived the firm of its most reliable source of income. The change of name to Horace Liveright, Inc., was largely due to confusion with the firm, Albert & Charles Boni, which the Boni brothers established in 1923.\n Liveright borrowed money repeatedly from Arthur Pell, the firm's treasurer, giving him stock in the firm as collateral. By 1930 he had lost control of the firm of which he had been co-founder. When Pell emerged as the firm's majority shareholder he forced Liveright to leave. Liveright moved to Hollywood where he worked briefly at Paramount and then Pathé Studios before returning to New York in the summer of 1931, where he died two years later at the age of forty-nine. In December 1931 Pell changed the name of the firm to Liveright, Inc. Pell did what he could to avert the slide into bankruptcy, but on 4 May 1933 three of its creditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the firm (Gilmer, pp. 232-33). Other publishers rushed in to sign up the leading Liveright authors. Robinson Jeffers received thirteen telegrams from publishers the day the bankruptcy was announced (Melrich V. Rosenberg to Cerf, 17 September 1933). Even more sought after was Eugene O'Neill, whose plays, Cerf once noted, \"sold like novels\" (Gelb and Gelb, p. 768). Cerf set out to get both authors, though he thought the odds against getting O'Neill were about fifteen to one (Cerf to Crowder, 23 May 1933).\n O'Neill relied on his friend Saxe Commins, who had recently become his editor at Liveright, to advise him on the choice of a new publisher. After examining the offers, Commins indicated a preference for Cerf and Random House. As he explained later,\n\nThe reason for the choice was that I had known Bennett professionally during the Liveright days and recognized in him the potential of an imaginative, resourceful, adventurous and most trustworthy publisher. From my first meeting with his partner, Donald S. Klopfer, I was impressed by his quiet confidence, his reliability, and his good sense. Subsequently . . . I was to learn of his many attributes, not the least of which is his complete selflessness (Commins, quoted in Dorothy Commins, What Is an Editor?, p. 26).\n\nCerf was invited to fly down to Sea Island, Georgia, to meet with O'Neill and Commins. O'Neill signed with Random House in June; Jeffers signed a day or so later. One of the first acts of the reorganized Liveright Publishing Corporation was to deliver the plates of its books by O'Neill and Jeffers to the ML's printers (Liveright Publishing, Inc., to the Modern Library, Inc., 9 August 1933; reproduced in Egleston, pp. 107–08).\n Cerf and Klopfer also considered trying to get Theodore Dreiser, the most important novelist on the Liveright list. After O'Neill and Jeffers signed with Random House Klopfer composed a letter to Dreiser making an offer, but the letter, dated 20 June 1933, appears never to have been sent. The original as well as the carbon copy remains in the Random House Collection at Columbia University. One can only speculate why Cerf and Klopfer changed their minds. Cerf did not like Dreiser personally, and Dreiser was a notoriously difficult author to deal with. He distrusted publishers in general and Jewish publishers in particular. In the end, over a year after the Liveright bankruptcy, he signed with Simon and Schuster. He completed nothing of importance during the eight acrimonious years he remained with the firm. By 1939 he owed Simon and Schuster over ten thousand dollars in unearned advances and other charges (Madison, p. 108).\n In addition to O'Neill and Jeffers, Random House acquired the editorial services of Saxe Commins. One of O'Neill's conditions for coming to Random House was that his editor come with him. Random House needed a full-time editor if it was to become seriously involved in trade publishing, and Commins was developing into one of the best book editors of his generation. Already the editor of Eugene O'Neill, at Random House he was to become renowned as the editor of William Faulkner and also of W. H. Auden, Isak Dinesen, Sinclair Lewis, James Michener, Budd Schulberg, Irwin Shaw, Stephen Spender, and many others. Commins started at Random House on 9 July 1933 and remained editor-in-chief until his death in 1958, a quarter of a century later.\n After merging two volumes by Maupassant into one and four volumes by Wilde into two in 1932, the ML continued its efforts to make ML books a better value by adding Erewhon Revisited to its edition of Samuel Butler's Erewhon (146b).",

    "general": "Cerf and Klopfer published the first authorized American edition of James Joyce's Ulysses in January 1934. The book appeared under the Random House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The Modern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of the firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back copies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and Company, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate Sylvia Beach. Ulysses was officially banned in the United States and tourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at customs.\n Cerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell Ulysses before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of the Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the work bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to be seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and attorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random House. Judge Woolsey's decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized the literary stature of Ulysses and concluded that \"nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\" The prohibition against its importation into the United States was overturned.\n The Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey's decision, a foreword by Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at $3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH edition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over $30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). Ulysses (G50) was added to ML Giants in 1940.\n Other trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint included a four-volume edition of Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, Gertrude Stein's Four Saints in Three Acts, volumes of poetry by W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's play Merrily We Roll Along, and William Saroyan's Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze.",

    "title": "MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1936",
    "year": "1936",
    "general": "The most important step in Random House's growth as a trade publisher came in 1936 when Cerf and Klopfer acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert K. Haas. Smith and Haas had been in business for just over five years, but both men had solid experience in publishing. Smith had been an editor at Harcourt, Brace & Co., where one of his authors was Sinclair Lewis. Shortly before the Wall Street crash he joined the English publisher Jonathan Cape in establishing the firm Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith in New York. He left that firm in October 1931 to go into business with Haas, who had been a founder of the Book-of-the-Month Club and served as its president for five years. Smith and Haas published many important books, but the early 1930s was a difficult time to launch a new publishing firm and Smith and Haas remained financially insecure. When Cerf and Klopfer suggested a merger with Random House they agreed. Haas recalled the circumstances as follows:\n \n We had a small, but I think extraordinarily distinguished, list. We did everything but make money. We were not quite in the black, but it was coming; we had been doing better each year. . . . Then one day Bennett Cerf who had been an acquaintance, although not an intimate friend, of mine for some years . . . asked if we would consider merging with them, because they were anxious to get a list of trade books. . . . That appealed to me very much because I thought the Modern Library was the finest list of books of its kind in the whole world (Haas interview, \"The Book-of-the-Month Club,\" Oral History Research Office, Columbia University, 1954–55, pp. 963–64).\n \n The merger gave Random House a ready-made trade list that included such authors as William Faulkner, Isak Dinesen, André Malraux, Robert Graves, Maurice Hindus, Edgar Snow, and Louis Fischer. It also gave Random House a children's department under the direction of Louise Bonino and a children's list that included Jean de Brunhoff's Babar books.\n The firm's corporate name changed from The Modern Library, Inc., to Random House, Inc. The Modern Library became a subsidiary of its offspring. Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners of Random House. Cerf was president, Haas was vice-president, Klopfer was treasurer, and Smith was secretary. Cerf described the reorganization in a letter to Gertrude Stein:\n\n The actual structure of the new firm leaves one-third of the business belonging to me, one-third to Donald, and the other one-third to be divided between the two new partners. This means, of course, that in a pinch we will always be running the show. As a matter of fact, however, both of the new partners are not only very charming men, but are extremely competent and highly regarded by the publishing world. I am absolutely sure that everything will work out beautifully (Cerf to Stein, 28 February 1936, Random House Collection).\n The transition is documented in the title leaves of ML books published between January and May 1936. January and February titles include Cerf and Klopfer's names on the title page as part of the imprint; beginning in March Cerf and Klopfer's names are omitted from the imprint. Original ML introductions are copyrighted under the name The Modern Library, Inc., through April. Beginning in May 1936 Random House, Inc., becomes the copyright holder, and the names of all four owners are recorded on the verso of the title page (see examples under \"Title Page\" below).\n Smith remained at Random House for less than a year. The firm did not need a fourth partner, and Smith had a flair for forgetting dates and losing manuscripts that Cerf found irritating (Cerf, At Random, p. 123). He once described Smith as \"the only man who ever mislaid six manuscripts simultaneously in the same desk\" (Cerf, \"Trade Winds,\" Saturday Review of Literature, 18 April 1942, p. 20). When Smith resigned as of 1 January 1937 he commented, \"I have discovered that the combined staff of both houses was so completely and fully manned on the editorial side that it did not leave enough active work for me in the future\" (Harrison Smith to Fletcher Pratt, 30 December 1936, Random House Collection). He later became the publisher of Saturday Review of Literature.\n After Smith's departure Cerf, Klopfer and Haas each owned one-third of Random House and the Modern Library. Haas, who was eight years older than Cerf and twelve years older than Klopfer, remained an active partner until his retirement in 1956.\n The acquisition of Smith and Haas was the second of three events in the 1930s that were of major importance in the development of Random House as a trade publisher. The first was the acquisition of Eugene O'Neill and the hiring of Saxe Commins as editor in 1933 after the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc. The third was the arrival of Lewis Miller in August 1936.\n Miller came to Random House from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary, where he had been sales manager and played an important role in the success of the firm's full-sized reprints, Star Dollar Books. He moved to Random House to develop a reprint line under the resurrected Carlton House imprint, but that venture was unsuccessful and in January 1938 he became sales manager for Random House and the Modern Library. He was one of the best sales managers in the business and it was in that capacity that he played a major role in the development of Random House. He remained with the firm until his retirement in 1967. Klopfer once stated that Miller was \"responsible for Random House being as big a firm as it was\" (Klopfer, interview with GBN, 1 June 1977).\n \nNumber of titles\nTen new titles were added and ten titles were discontinued. The number of titles in the regular ML remained stable at 213, making 1936 the first year in which the number of titles in the regular series did not increase. Six new titles were published in ML Giants series, bringing the Giants to twenty-eight titles in thirty volumes."

    "title": "Modern Library Series 1939",
    "year": "1939",
    "general": "The ML underwent a major change in format and design for the second time in its history. The first, in 1929, substituted balloon cloth bindings for imitation leather and introduced Rockwell Kent's binding and endpaper designs. (Balloon cloth began to be used in January 1929; Kent's binding and endpaper designs were introduced in April.) The balloon cloth format suffered from two problems. The semi-flexible balloon cloth bindings were attractive but did not stand up to heavy use. And the 6½ x 4¼ inch (165 x 107 mm) page size, retained from Boni & Liveright days, sometimes made it difficult to print from original publishers' letterpress plates, most of which were designed for a larger format. Many of the volumes printed from original publishers' plates had uncomfortably narrow margins. Sometimes the original plates were too large to be used by the ML.\n The ML's economic model assumed multiple printings, and all ML books were printed from plates. For older titles in the public domain the ML usually ordered new typesettings from which new plates were made. Copyrighted works were printed whenever possible from the original publisher's plates. In general, the ML expected to pay royalties or typesetting and plate-making costs but tried whenever possible to avoid paying both. Royalties paid by the ML to the original publisher were regarded in part as a plate rental. In this respect the ML operated no differently than Grosset & Dunlap and other publishers of hardbound reprints of current books. Grosset & Dunlap differed from the ML in that its printings were closer in size to the original publishers' editions, and it rarely had problems using original publishers' plates.\n The ML had several options when the original publisher's plates were too large for its format. The most expensive option was to reset the work to fit its format and make new letterpress plates. When the ML did this for copyrighted titles the original publisher occasionally agreed to forego royalties in whole or part until the plates were paid for. A second option was to photograph a clean copy of the original publisher's edition, reduce the size of the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography. The disadvantage of this approach was that before the 1960s offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing and the quality was inferior. Another option when the original publisher's plates were only slightly too large for the ML's format was to print from a duplicate set of plates with the headline removed. Finally, the ML could print a given title in a slightly larger format in order to accommodate the original publisher's plates. The ML resorted to this option on several occasions during the balloon cloth era, and once—for Charles Jackson's The Lost Weekend (406), a short-lived title published in 1948—after the introduction of its larger format in fall 1939.\n Another problem with the balloon cloth format was that it made it harder to sell ML books to libraries. Many libraries did not buy ML books before the 1940s because the bindings did not stand up to heavy use and the narrow margins made rebinding difficult.\n A new format that corrected both faults was introduced in September 1939 with Six Plays of Clifford Odets (321) and John Steinbeck, In Dubious Battle (322). The page size was increased half an inch to 7 x 4¾ inches (176 x 120 mm). And the balloon cloth binding was replaced with a far more durable binding constructed of stiff boards covered with smooth linen. The new binding, designed by Joseph Blumenthal, is described below. Two spring 1939 titles, Irving Stone, Lust for Life (317) and Isak Dinesen, Seven Gothic Tales (320), were published in the larger format with balloon cloth bindings.\nThe introduction of the larger format for regular ML volumes meant that existing jackets had to be replaced or redesigned. A few titles received enlarged versions of their existing jackets, but most were outfitted in newly designed jackets. Two designers were responsible for most of the new jackets that were introduced at this period. Joseph Blumenthal created a large number of elegant typographic jackets. The majority of new pictorial jackets were by Paul Galdone, a Hungarian-born illustrator of children's books who designed his first ML jackets in 1937. Many ML Giants also received new jackets to go with their new bindings, although the size of the Giants remained unchanged.\n The introduction of the new format involved reprinting backlist titles at an accelerated pace so the series could regain a uniform appearance as quickly as possible. It also presented the ML with the problem of disposing of balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse. When the first two titles in new format were published in September 1939, over 200 regular ML titles remained in the balloon cloth format. It would be February 1941 before the ML could announce, \"Every title in the MODERN LIBRARY (95¢) is now ready in the new binding!\" (PW 139, 15 February 1941, pp. 814–15).\n An arrangement with the Book-of-the-Month Club, which appears to have begun in fall 1938, may have been conceived in part as a way of reducing the inventory of balloon cloth titles. The Book-of-the-Month Club offered free Modern Library books, all in balloon cloth bindings and 1930s jackets, to members who made advance deposits of $12 or more against future purchases. Two 16-page brochures titled \"Free Books\" are known to exist. The first is undated, gives the Book-of-the-Month Club's address as 386 Fourth Avenue, New York, and includes Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby—now one of the most sought-after ML titles (MLC 46, p. 1). The second catalog, dated 3-39 (March 1939), uses the Club's new address, 385 Madison Avenue. The March 1939 catalog can be viewed online at http://www.modernlib.com/General/brochures/BOMC/BOMC39.html (accessed 24 August 2017). It lists 103 titles from the regular ML and 42 Giants—half of the titles then in the series—along with books from five other reprint series. The Great Gatsby, which had been discontinued at the end of 1938, is not included in the second catalog, although a large number of unsold copies remained in the ML warehouse. Any hint that the offer was essentially a remaindering operation was avoided. Book-of-the-Month Club members were also given the option of buying ML books at the regular price. The arrangement with the Book-of-the-Month Club suggests that the ML planned the transition to the new format well in advance.\n Most of the 110,000 balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse in early 1941 were disposed of at a widely publicized sale at Macy's, the New York department store. Macy's was one of the leading retailers of ML books, and it made a cash offer for the remaining stock of balloon cloth bindings. The sale was announced in a full-page ad in the Sunday New York Times (2 February 1941, p. 27). The ad listed 166 titles that were available in quantities of 100 copies or more. Another 50 balloon cloth titles were available in smaller quantities. The sale price for books in the discontinued binding was 33 cents. Three books were 94 cents; the price for twenty was $5.98. The sale began Monday morning at 9:30, and the books sold out in less than a week.\n Once the transition to the new format was complete, the ML invited booksellers to return their remaining stock of balloon cloth titles for replacement with volumes in the new format. Booksellers had a one-month window during which balloon cloth volumes could be exchanged. By February 1941, 700 accounts had returned around 160,000 books and received an equal number of volumes in the Blumenthal format at no cost. Two months later Cerf indicated that returns of balloon cloth volumes were expected to run to more than 200,000 copies. At that time the ML had not decided what would be done with the returned books, but the U.S. Government was expected to buy thousands of them for libraries in cantonments where new troops were billeted (PW 139, 8 February 1941, p. 741; 15 February 1941, pp. 814–15; 5 April 1941, p. 1459).\n The year that saw the introduction of the ML's new format was also the year that the twentieth-century paperback revolution spread to the United States. The paperback revolution in the English-speaking world was launched by Allan Lane, who founded Penguin Books in 1935. Pocket Books, Inc., established in 1939, was the first American publisher of mass-market paperbacks. It operated very differently from the ML. The 6½ x 4 inch (164 x 105 mm) format of mass-market paperbacks was smaller than the ML's original format. Pocket Books ordered new typesettings for all of its titles, printed its books on high-speed magazine presses in print runs vastly larger than the ML's, and priced the books at 25 cents. Magazine wholesalers, who distributed the books to mass-market outlets such as drug stores and newsstands, treated paperback books as they did magazines. Newly published titles were distributed monthly. Credit for unsold copies of the previous month's books was secured by tearing off the front covers and returning the covers. The coverless books were then pulped.",

    "general": "The war brought many changes to Random House. Klopfer, who was thirty-nine, applied for a commission in the Air Force. He was commissioned as a captain in May 1942 and left for training in California at the end of month. He was away from Random House until after the war. The war years were good ones for him. He was posted to England with the Eighth Air Force in October 1943 and served as an intelligence officer for a heavy bomber squadron—the job he wanted. When he stopped by Random House to say his final goodbyes before leaving for London, Cerf thought he looked \"happier and more excited than I have ever seen him in my life before\" (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library). Early the following year he was promoted to major (Cerf, \"Trade Winds,\" Saturday Review of Literature, 12 February 1944, p. 19).\n Cerf was four years older than Klopfer and too old for military service. He remained a civilian, looking after Random House and playing an active role in the Council on Books in Wartime, of which he was a director. \"I get damned impatient plugging away at publishing,\" he told a friend in the service in 1943, \"while all of you fellows are out there doing things I'd like to be doing myself, but I may as well face the fact that I am 45, that I am nearsighted as a bat, and that somebody has to keep Random House rolling along\" (Cerf to Smart, 26 August 1943, Random House Collection).\n Random House rolled through the war years with increasing momentum. The firm was fortunate in that Klopfer was the only senior member who left to enter the service. Commins, several years older than Cerf, remained at Random House throughout the war, as did Haas, who was in his early fifties. It was Haas, however, who was touched most deeply by the war. His son, a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy, was killed in action in 1943.\n Random House had grown slowly in the 1930s. Each year sales increased over the previous year, but the increases were often small. The firm's sales did not reach a million dollars until 1941. Beginning with sales of $256,000 in 1926, it took Cerf and Klopfer fifteen years to reach the million-dollar figure. Thereafter, sales increased rapidly. Cerf wrote in 1943, \"I think we have reached the major leagues as publishers now, and I damn well mean for us to stay there\" (Cerf to Smart, 26 August 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\n Part of Random House's wartime growth could be attributed to a series of best-selling war books. The firm's first big seller in this category was Cecil Brown's Suez to Singapore, about the sinking of the British battleship Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser Repulse several days after Pearl Harbor. It appeared in August 1942. Shortly thereafter came Richard Tregaskis's Guadalcanal Diary, published in January 1943. It was the first Random House book to sell over 100,000 copies (Cerf, At Random, p. 163). Random House's next big war book was Thirty Seconds over Tokyo by Ted W. Lawson.\n During the war Cerf began to be well-known to the public at large as a writer and speaker. He took over the \"Trade Winds\" column in Saturday Review of Literature in February 1942. For the next fifteen years he enlivened the magazine's pages with a weekly mixture of publishing gossip, jokes, and stories. He also began to compile what became a long series of best-selling humor books. The first, The Pocket Book of War Humor, was an original paperback published by Pocket Books early in 1943. It was a collection, edited by Cerf, of previously published material. His objective in compiling it was to do something to dispel the widespread despondency that followed the American loss of the Philippines and Bataan (Cerf, At Random, p. 174). The book sold over a million copies.\n Cerf's next project was a collection of humorous anecdotes and stories, Try and Stop Me, published by Simon and Schuster in 1944. It became a bestseller and was widely distributed in an Armed Services Edition to members of the armed services around the world. \"It was just the kind of book they needed and appreciated—it made them laugh,\" Cerf later recalled (At Random, p. 181). He subsequently wrote many other humor books, but he always regarded Try and Stop Me as his best (At Random, p. 180). The book led to a newspaper column syndicated to several hundred newspapers by King Features. Also called \"Try and Stop Me,\" it started as a serialization of the book, but when that material was used up, Cerf supplied new stories and jokes to keep the column going. But Cerf never overestimated his own publications. In a 1945 letter to Gertrude Stein, whom he had not seen since before the war, he wrote:\n\nYou write asking whether I have changed any since you saw me last. I honestly don't think I have. I am a bit grayer, of course, and don't get around a tennis court quite as fast as I used to, but I like to think that my whole attitude to life hasn't changed a bit. Certainly I am getting more fun out of it today than I ever did before. Besides the publishing, which has gone beautifully, I have been writing trivia for magazines and in book form and, while I know it is utterly unimportant drivel, people seem to like it and want more of it (Cerf to Gertrude Stein, 17 March 1945, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\n\nWhen a reader wrote Cerf in 1954 suggesting that his humor books be brought together and published as a ML Giant, he responded that he was flattered. \"But quite honestly,\" he added, \"I'm not good enough\" (Cerf to Ralph Winans, 22 July 1954, Random House Collection).\n Cerf was as engaging a speaker as he was a writer. His first major exposure came with tours of well-known writers selling war bonds for the Treasury Department. This was followed by a weekly radio program for the Council of Books in Wartime called \"Books Are Bullets\" in which he interviewed authors of war books. The radio program led to lecture tours through the Colston Leigh Agency. By the early 1950s, through extensive lecturing and, even more so, as a result of his participation as a regular panelist on the Sunday evening television program \"What's My Line,\" Cerf had become a celebrity. He enjoyed being a celebrity, and the publicity he attracted brought enhanced recognition of Random House among the public at large.",

    "general": "By 1943 the impact of gasoline rationing and other wartime restrictions had reduced the ways in which people could spend leisure time away from home. They turned in large numbers to reading as an alternative. Demand for books was such that almost anything publishers brought out was snatched-up. Few publishers had ever encountered such demand for books and the experience was dazzling. But it also had drawbacks. \"When you are able to sell any junk that you can get between covers,\" Cerf commented, \"it takes the kick out of putting over the really good numbers\" (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943). Between 1942 and 1943, sales of ML books increased from $339,902 to $596,454.\n The war brought not only increased demand for books in general but also shifts in demand for certain types of books. Books dealing with the war itself were popular. But there also seems to have been increased demand for books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry and philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a disproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong among men in the service. \nThe Modern Library's most notable new venture in the 1940s was a series called the Illustrated Modern Library. It was launched in 1943 in the midst of the war. Each volume contained specially commissioned illustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell, Salvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz Kredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes were one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in individually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943 in time for the Christmas season. Fourteen additional titles were issued between 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library initially sold for $1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war forced the discontinuation of the series.",
    "numberTitles": "Seven titles were added to the series and three were discontinued, bringing the total number of titles in the list to 231. \n \nFormat \nTitles published in 1943 were 7¼ x 4 inch page size with individually designed title pages. Many of the title pages were designed by Joseph Blumenthal, who set them at his Spiral Press and made electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library's regular printers. The binding, also designed by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth linen. Blumenthal's binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or dark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped in gold. Kent's torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on the spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were bordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside each panel.\n The bindings were red, blue, green, or gray. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings used from 1929 through spring 1939, each printing of a given title was available in only one color.\n Rockwell Kent's endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ by 1 inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials \"ml\" with the torchbearers; for the rest of the endpapers, there were torchbearers on the paste-down and free endpapers facing each other, light brownish gray (63); endpapers in medium orange (53)."

    "general": "Three new ML titles published in spring 1944—Bergson, Creative Evolution (368), Kaufman and Hart, Six Plays (369), and Melville, Moby Dick (G65)—along with a number of backlist titles that were reprinted that spring, include the following statement on the verso of the title page:\n\nPublished by A. S. Barnes & Co., Inc.\nDistributed by Random House, Inc.\n\n Paper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in demand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable to satisfy the demand for books.\nThe War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry in fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota based on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to 90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions became increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional 10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year.\n Most publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a few—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In fall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the textbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated Modern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board requirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series while RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles, including those noted above, were also published under this arrangement. The ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several other publishers that had surplus paper.\n The War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in March 1944. Cerf stated, \"Last year, we and several other publishers were able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from college text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for the duration [of the war]. We counted on doing the same this year. When the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire production schedule was knocked into a cocked hat\" (Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944).\n All subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by Random House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML stopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued to appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to go out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The profit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants were paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML books, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length. \n A. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the Illustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was limited. Random House continued to select titles for the series, commission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate making, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were reprinted.",

Bindings were red, blue, green or gray. Rockwell Kent's endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ x 1 inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials \"ml\" with the torchbearers."

They were issued in paper covers and sold initially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular Modern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they were issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward the academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a distinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new series had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath Brooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson, Royal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray, Mark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and Morton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in regular Modern Library printings as well. \n Many of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken over the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often than not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met. In contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College Editions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They were, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was beginning to eat into the Modern Library's college market with their regular Modern Library series.\n That series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart & Co. in late 1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics aimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to seventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound volumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were well-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics. \n The Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess Stein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions from the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore orders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois. \n The Random House juvenile department, already well established with such authors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to the firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched in 1950.",

In contrast to the initial group of forty-one non-royalty bearing titles, several of those added in 1951 required royalty payments. Despite these additions, the Modern Library College Editions began to encounter difficulties in its second year. Production costs were going up and college enrollments temporarily declined as the pool of former soldiers attending college on the G.I bill exhausted. The series did not fully recover until 1956.

Initially, Random House was attracted by the idea of obtaining rights for the Modern Library of a number of new translations commissioned for Penguin Classics, a distinguished and highly successful series that began in 1946. Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had been criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux's 1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes's Don Quixote; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of Iliad and Odyssey; Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's Plays; and anonymous translations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had superior translations of these and other works.\n In March 1954, Klopfer received a letter from Milton Waldman of the British publishing firm Rupert Hart-Davis, who wrote that Lane had expressed an interest in arranging for joint publication of various classics with the Modern Library (Milton Waldman to Klopfer, 31 March 1954). Jess Stein was given the job of examining the translations in Penguin Classics. He prepared a long memorandum for Klopfer in which he indicated which Penguin translations would be desirable for the Modern Library. However, nothing came of the negotiations with Lane and in 1955, Random House launched the Modern Library Paperbacks. \n \nNumber of titles\nEight titles were added and five were discontinued.

A Random House memorandum in July outlined a possible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American market. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in America, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin obligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library Paperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August, Cerf told Lane: \"We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on the situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own paper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands\" (Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at this point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer wrote Lane: \n\nAlmost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I'll be delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to Lane, 28 August 1958). \n\nBut the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House expanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with Viking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin. \nThe Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original publishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February 1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the Modern Library's contract for Conrad's Victory and put it into an Anchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because Victory was only five years away from entering the public domain. But other significant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking Press withdrew James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in 1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn.",

    "general": "As costs rose steadily in the years following the war, retail prices inevitably had to be increased. Publishers at this period, however, feared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off raising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no alternative. The $1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954. It increased to $1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1 January 1957, the price rose again, this time to $1.65.\nAs long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the Modern Library's reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents per copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the retail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers to whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties were going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no general policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to be paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only when pressure from individual authors and publishers left no alternative.\nIn 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in royalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of Little, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions. \nRandom House's printed contracts for its own authors included a clause concerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the Modern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed figure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House's own authors in the event of price increases. \nSales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing steadily since the mid-1950's, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark for the first time in 1957.",

    "general": "In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the Modern Library's subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason Epstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at Doubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books pioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other publishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a brilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the publishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who also admired Epstein's aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and difficult to work with. \nPart of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an independent imprint of children's books, the Looking Glass Library, which Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make his fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after several years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for Modern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern Library itself. \nDespite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of the series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another person, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have saved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have accelerated the series' demise. The effort to make the series a vital up-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been abandoned, either because academia's response was disappointing or because to do the job right would have been too expensive for the potential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of contemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library's image as a series of indisputably significant books. \nEpstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a change from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the Modern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had always been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial success had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series might have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at a minimum.",

As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on the verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959, publishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book Company, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin, Macmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12 October 1959, p. 27). \nOn 2 October 1959, Random House became a public corporation: 222,060 shares of Random House stock were placed on sale at $11.25 a share. Cerf and Klopfer remained firmly in control of the firm; the stock sold to the public represented only 30 percent of Random House's total stock. As a result of the sale, Cerf and Klopfer each received a check for more than a million dollars. \nMaking Random House a public organization changed the nature of the business. Cerf has written:\n\nSuddenly Random House embarked on its financial career and expansion. This marked a big change, since the minute you go public, outsiders own some of your stock and you've got to make periodic reports to them. You owe your investors dividends and profits. Instead of working for yourself and doing what you damn please, willing to risk a loss on something you want to do, if you're any kind of honest man, you feel a real responsibility to your stockholders. It was a very important decision (Cerf, At Random, pp. 277–78). \n\nThe following year, Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and its outstanding quality paperback line, Vintage Books. But while Random House and publishing in general were thriving, the 1950s marked the end of the growth of the Modern Library. By the mid-1960s, interest in the Modern Library on the part of the public was low and the series was in serious trouble.",
