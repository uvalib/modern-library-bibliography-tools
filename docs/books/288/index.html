The actual murder of a member of a revolutionary circle by his fellow conspirators first gave Dostoyevsky the idea for the book in which he turned against the radicals and socialists with whom he had earlier identified. As Avrahm Yarmolinsky observes in his Foreword, “",
        "The Possessed",
        "testifies to the fact that Dostoyevsky was not without some insight into the nature of the upheaval from which he was separated by nearly half a century.” Revolution, however, is not the sole theme of this novel, rich in insight, imaginative power and strongly drawn characters, which ranks with Dostoyevsky’s major works."
