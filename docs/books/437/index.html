It contains thirteen narrative poems and lyrical dramas, the shorter lyrical and reflective poems and a selection of prefaces and essays. In the prose section are to be found prefaces to “The Revolt of Islam,” “Prometheus Unbound,” “The Cenci,” and such important essays as “On a Future State,” “On the Punishment of Death,” “On Metaphysics,” “A Defence of Poetry” and others. Carlos Baker of Princeton University contributes a penetrating analysis of Shelley’s work and thought in an introduction which includes biographical and bibliographical notes. (",
