        "The history of W. Somerset Maugham’s masterpiece is a significant commentary on the changing and maturing taste in fiction. When it appeared in 1915, a few discerning critics hailed it as one of the first important novels of the twentieth century. For several years the public remained apathetic and the book almost suffered the fate of the casual novel. But its loyal champions fought to save it from oblivion. Today, no more popular novel exists in the English language. It has been one of the two best sellers in the entire Modern Library series for the last three years. (",
