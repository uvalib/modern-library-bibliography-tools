Macmillan indicated that it would not be available for fall 1942. Cerf feared that a delay would reduce interest in the book on the grounds that “the subject matter is likely to curdle as our relations with Russia grow more friendly” (Cerf to James Putnam, Macmillan, 25 March 1942). A month later he wrote about publishing a ML edition in spring 1943, offering an advance of $500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Brett, 27 April 1942)."
