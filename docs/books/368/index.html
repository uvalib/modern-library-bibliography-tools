Influential among philosophers and popular among general readers because of its persuasive argument and vivid illustrations, this book has achieved permanence in the literature of philosophical speculation. It takes an honored place in the Modern Library series as a work of enduring vitality and ever–renewing meaning to succeeding generations of thoughtful readers. (",

I am taking Irwin Edman’s word on this one” (Cerf to William Sloan, Holt, 15 March 1943). He offered an advance of $1,000 on the assumption that the ML would be able to print from Holt plates, but Sloan discovered that the plates had been melted as part of the war effort. Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with the plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that composition and plates would cost at least $500 and suggested reducing the advance from $1,000 to $750, to which Cerf agreed. Edman received $250 for the Foreword (Commins to Edman, 2 December 1943)."
