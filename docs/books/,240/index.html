A compilation which includes Marlowe, Dekker, Heywood, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Massinger and Ford must be a treasury to be cherished by every modern reader.

Odell approved the plays but declined to write the introduction because he was on sabbatical in Paris. That fall Cerf invited a succession of scholars to write the introduction—Hardin Craig of Stanford University, Felix E. Schelling of the University of Pennsylvania, J. F. A. Pyre of the University of Wisconsin, and John Livingston Lowes of Harvard University. As one after another declined, Cerf doubled the fee from fifty to one hundred dollars. Esther Cloudman Dunn of Smith College accepted the assignment in February 1932 and received the $100 fee."
