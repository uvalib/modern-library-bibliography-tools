And what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story” (Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to Durant, 10 September 1928).

ANTHONY because of complete lack of demand, and even MADAME BOVARY doesn’t sell one-quarter of what it did ten and fifteen years ago” (Cerf to Farrell, 2 February 1939)."
