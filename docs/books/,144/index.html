The scene is the one in which Arabella first makes Jude’s acquaintance by flinging the pizzle of a pig at him (Chapter vi of Part I). In the original version the franker imagery makes unmistakably clear  the root of the attraction that Arabella has for Jude, and a modern reader may well find the original text more effective. A portion of the scene illustrates the difference:"
