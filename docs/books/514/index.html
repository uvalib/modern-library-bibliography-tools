        "The question, “What is society?” is one that was pondered long before there was such a word as",
        "sociology",
        ". This book shows some of the ways men in all ages have dealt with this question and others concerning man’s relations with his fellow-men. The range is from Plato and Aristotle to the recent leading figures—Znaniecki, Park, Sorokin, MacIver, Mannheim, Lundberg, Becker, Parsons—and the Introduction by Robert Bierstedt traces, clearly and concisely, the history of sociological theory and concludes with a statement about the problems sociologists are most concerned with today.
