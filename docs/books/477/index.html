A brilliant group of new dramatists has come forward during the last few years, and their works—produced here and abroad—bear out the reputation of our stage as an alive, dynamic force. Six of the best plays by six of the finest new talents are included here: “A Streetcar Named Desire” by Tennessee Williams; “Death of a Salesman” by Arthur Miller; “The Seven Year Itch” by George Axelrod; “Come Back, Little Sheba” by William Inge; and “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial” by Herman Wouk.
