The terrible conclusion gathers inevitably, though here is no purification of tragedy, no beating drums of a new era. In re-reading the novel, one notes how the author avoided the romantic temptation of making the House itself subjective; until in the last sentence—and this is true to country superstition and to physical belief—it assumes a sudden ominous existence: “They gazed with blanched faces at the House with the Green Shutters, sitting dark there and terrible beneath the radiant arch of the dawn!”"

It came out in 1900, and was the first book that represented the reaction against the Victorian modes and moods” (Seltzer fall 1924 catalogue, p. 3). Cerf and Klopfer were equally enthusiastic. Cerf asked Heywood Broun to write the introduction to the ML edition, describing the work as “one of the swellest novels written in the past thirty years, and one that we hope to make twenty-five times as popular as it is, when we bring it out in the Modern Library” (Cerf to Broun, 26 October 1926)."
