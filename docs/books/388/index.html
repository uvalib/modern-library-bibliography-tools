He is [+original, he is] funny and he is profound; he is clever and he is surprisingly penetrating; there are always both rhyme and reason in his sensible nonsense. For this Modern Library edition, Ogden Nash has made his own selection of 165 of his most representative poems, each one a gem of humor and light-hearted wisdom. (",
