Could you persuade them to publish some of Dr. C. G. Jung’s writings. They are so scattered it is difficult to obtain the more important parts.” Fadiman commented, “Not as crazy as it sounds—the Jung cult is fairly large, the name better and better known, and the Bollingen translations are good and easily buyable from Kurt [Wolff, the founder of Pantheon Books]” (Fadiman to Klopfer, 13 April 1956). Klopfer replied, “We have been negotiating with the Bollingen people for months, and expect to have a title in the Modern Library in 1957” (Klopfer to Fadiman, 20 April 1956)."
