The young Candide is expelled from the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh for making love to the Baron’s daughter, Cunégonde; and thereafter he, Pangloss and Cunégonde embark on what develops into a long series of adventures. Sometimes together, usually apart, in various corners of the earth, they endure a brutal succession of the most unfair and calamitous events conceivable. Eventually they settle down together on a little farm. Candide marries Cunégonde, now grown ugly as a radish, and tells himself often, “We must cultivate our garden.”"
