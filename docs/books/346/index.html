        "World events are rapidly catching up with the prophecies made by Nostradamus three hundred years ago. Whether his predictions were accidental or based upon an occult foreknowledge, they are frequently uncanny in their accuracy. His book of oracles is having a tremendous vogue at present, partly because of the wide variety of interpretations that can be made from his prognostications, but mainly because it makes fascinating reading when related to the catastrophes announced daily while the world is in crisis. This edition [±volume], edited by Charles A. Ward, gives special emphasis to prophecies of contemporary events and those immediately ahead. (",
