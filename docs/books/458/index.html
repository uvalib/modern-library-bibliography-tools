        "For many years the editors of the Modern Library sought to include in the series a representative collection of plays by Bernard Shaw. Until now all their efforts were in vain because the author was adamant in his determination that no selection from his works could be issued during his lifetime in a reprint series. Finally, by special arrangement with Bernard Shaw’s American publishers (Dodd, Mead & Co.) and his estate, we are able to fulfill the twenty-five-year hope and offer in a single volume four of the major plays, with the famous prefaces complete and unabridged. An Introduction by Louis Kronenberger matches the brilliance and perception of the Shavian plays. (",

        "It was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to secure permission to include his plays. During his lifetime he retained tight control over his copyrights and refused to allow inexpensive editions of his plays. In 1946, toward the end of his life, he relaxed his opposition to cheap reprints and allowed Penguin Books to publish a million copies of his plays—ten volumes in printings of 100,000 copies each—on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. The ML was able to publish two volumes of his plays in the 1950s,",
