        "This book is one of the best accounts of the colorful period of Italian life and thought between 1350 and 1550. Here is a brilliant panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship between the individual and the forces around him. The combination makes this book one of the few great classics of history. (",

        "Klopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition of",
        "Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy",
        ". Stein thought the idea was a good one and indicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo Holborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some required college sale and am quite confident that it will have a satisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October 1953). Holborn received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11 November 1953)."

Cerf offered George Allen & Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a courtesy fee of $500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any considerable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that will balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities but less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953). The ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen & Unwin and includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C. Middlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged rendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by comparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig Goldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes and has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material preceded by asterisks” (p. [iv])."

It created methods of reviving the past which will have a lasting influence on the writing of history. Finally, it opened a deep view of the relationship between the human individual and the forces of history.” Rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners and thought of one of the most innovative eras in human history, this brilliant panorama of Renaissance life is also a thorough examination of the nature of civilization and of man’s place within it. Burckhardt’s encyclopedic knowledge, his mastery of style, and his genius for synthesis make this one of the few great classics of history."
