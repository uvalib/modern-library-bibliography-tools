He solicited advice from Marion Bacon of the Vassar Cooperative Bookshop, Carlos Baker of Princeton University, John Burrell, Marion Dodd of the Hampshire Bookshop, Geraldine Gordon of the Hathaway House Bookshop in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Norman Pearson of Yale University, and George Stewart (Cerf to Bacon, etc., 3–4 June 1948). Pearson did not regard Cooper as a publishing “natural” at that moment but indicated that",
        "The Pathfinder",
        "would be a good choice if the ML wanted a work by Cooper (Pearson to Cerf, 5 June 1948). Lanier also favored",
        "The Pathfinder",
        ". The response as a whole was not encouraging and Cerf decided to postpone a decision. He wrote to Marion Dodd, “What to do, what to do? I must admit we are very much up in the air about this. The vote at present seems to be about three for THE PATHFINDER to one for anything else, but I can detect no particular enthusiasm about Cooper at all in the letters I have received” (Cerf to Dodd, 24 June 1948)."
