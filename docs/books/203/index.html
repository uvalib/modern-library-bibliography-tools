I am having lunch with Hoyns later this week, and I hope we can make a deal with him without bothering you, but I do want to make a strong plea to have these books available in the small size inexpensive reprint, rather than just in the $2.50 library, deluxe size” (Klopfer to Huxley, 20 March 1939)."
