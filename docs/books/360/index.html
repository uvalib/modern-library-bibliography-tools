In addition to the ML they were used by Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press, Blakiston Co., Book League of America, and International Collector’s Library. The 360.2 plates reduced the length of the book by 100 pages by using smaller type and squeezing forty lines of text (five more than 360.1) to the page, thus significantly reducing printing costs. Both sets of plates used by the ML had been designed for full-sized books and in the ML’s compact format produced a type page with uncomfortably narrow margins."
