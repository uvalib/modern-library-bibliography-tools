        "Apologia Pro Vita Sua",
        ". It is far more than a vigorous defense of religious adherence; it is an affirmation of faith and conviction, a projection of a magnetic and powerful personality and a dynamic account of spiritual conversion. Anton C. Pegis, the renowned Thomist scholar and distinguished Catholic philosopher, provides an illuminating and perceptive introduction for Cardinal Newman’s masterpiece. (",

At Commins’s request Pegis secured a nihil obstat and imprimatur on his introduction. Commins sent Pegis a copy of the original 1864 edition to mark for composition purposes (Commins to Pegis, 10 April 1950). Pegis initially hoped to include Newman’s corrections from the 1865 edition but decided to use the original text accompanied by the correspondence with Charles Kingsley (pp. 373–90) and Kingsley’s pamphlet,",
