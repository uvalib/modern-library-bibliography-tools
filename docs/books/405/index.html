Now, under the supervision of Louis Kronenberger, distinguished critic and authority on the eighteenth century, the poems, essays, odes, satires, pastorals, epigrams, epitaphs and epistles have been selected for the delight of the modern reader. Here are, complete and unabridged, “The Dunciad,” “Essay on Man,” “Essay on Criticism,” “The Rape of the Lock” and a generous offering of miscellanies. (",
