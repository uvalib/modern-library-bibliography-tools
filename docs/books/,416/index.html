Cerf believed that the imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church would enhance sales and asked Sheen if it could be secured (Cerf to Sheen, 10 December 1948). Sheen did not think an imprimatur was necessary and doubted that it would affect sales, but after a second letter from Cerf he provided a name to contact (Sheen to Cerf, 18 January 1949). The Church approved the introduction but declined to give an imprimatur since Pusey was not a Catholic and his translation had not been submitted to the censor."
