        "Few men in history have ever been known as intimately as Samuel Johnson. Famous in his own time for his wit and wisdom, he has had the rare good fortune to gain a posthumous extension of personality and influence over a period of more than one hundred and sixty years. James Boswell’s boast that Johnson would “be seen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived” has been borne out in the greatest biography in the English language. To give the modern reader the spirit and substance of Johnson’s life and times, Bergen Evans, Professor of English at Northwestern University, has winnowed out the obscurities and irrelevances of the full text and kept its essence.

The abridgment was made from the definitive Hill-Powell edition; Oxford University Press authorized its use with the condition that the abridgment had to be limited to about half of the full text (Stein to Evans, 8 October 1951).

He began by making his own cuts, then hired “an intelligent widely-read person who has done some writing of her own & has a good, philosophic mind & a sense of style but no particular knowledge of Boswell’s Johnson.” He paid her $100 to go through the Hill-Powell edition, indicating the cuts she would make to cut it in half. Then he compared her cuts with his. “Where we agreed, I let the cuts stand. Where she had cut something sacred to the Johnson canon . . . I restored it. Where she had left in something that I had cut—or where I had left in something she had cut—we discussed its interest to the common reader.” By this means the work was reduced from over 500,000 words to about 270,000. Evans then went through the text again, “sacrificing some of my less-cherished retentions. Up to 270,000, I believe, nothing whatever of any value or significance . . . was taken out. My new cuts reduced it to 234,000. Then I went over it with a nail file & took out parenthetical interjections that were irrelevant, even parts of sentences that were not necessary to either the sense or the rhythm—not Johnson’s sentences so much as Boswell’s—and sections in otherwise-desirable letters that were in themselves uninteresting, such as reflections on the weather, or a comment on some unimportant person.”"
    },
    {
      "span": "He concluded: “There has never been an abridgement of Johnson anything like it. It reads as smoothly as the original. . . . No solid thought or fine stroke of wit has been omitted. It really is a vastly readable and entertaining book and I’m quite serious in feeling that it might have a wide popular appeal (Evans to Stein, 18 November 1951; underlining in original).”"
