The ML edition includes none of the illustrations from the Nonesuch Press edition, but both 319a and 319b retain Keynes’s reference to “the portrait by Jacob Huysman, from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved” (p. 12); a footnote indicates that the portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The revised “Life of Izaak Walton” in 319c omits the words, “from which the copper-plate in the present work has been engraved.” Keynes also refers to a pastel portrait of Walton by Edmund Ashfield. A footnote in 319a and 319b states, “Now in the possession of Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York”; the footnote in 319c reads, “Formerly in the possession of the late Dr. Samuel Lambert of New York” (p. 12)."
