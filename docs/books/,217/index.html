        "The world owes its intimate knowledge of the Caesars to the researches of Suetonius, who viewed Imperial Rome from the vantage point of the first years of the Christian era. With a wealth of realistic detail, with constant access to the private records in the possession of Hadrian and with a first-hand supply of scandalous anecdote, Suetonius enriched history with his vivid portraits of the flesh and blood Caesars. The veracity and impartiality of this record of personalities and events have made it endure through the centuries. (",
