        "“New Grub Street” is George Gissing’s book of the heart, a chronicle of characters that he knew through the intimacy of suffering shared and defeats experienced or understood. It is called back to life today because of the insistent determination of a new age to regard Gissing as a stylist second to none, a keen analyst of motives, and an extraordinary literary figure whose inexplicable hardships stir the imagination of an age surfeited with material things.

        ", one of the first exponents of Naturalism in English literature, has been described as a cross between the works of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, and is much acclaimed for its portrait of the unsuccessful literary life in 19th century London. It is the story of Edward Reardon, a novelist whose valiant and painstaking attempts to maintain the standards of his art in the face of severe financial pressure are opposed by an unsympathetic wife. In sharp contrast to Reardon is his friend Jasper Milvain, an essayist who adjusts himself with shocking ease to currently materialistic ideals. A grimly realistic look at the hardships and compromises of the modern literary world,",
