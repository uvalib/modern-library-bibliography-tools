        "For many years the editors of the Modern Library have sought a volume that would include within 700 [±its more than 600] pages the representative lyrical writings of the classic Roman poets. With this book that need is now fulfilled. It includes the widest possible variety of odes, satires, eclogues, elegies and epigrams that have come down the centuries from such poets as Catullus, Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, Seneca, Juvenal, Martial and others. The translations by many skilled hands are the best obtainable, and the Introduction by F. R. B. Godolphin brilliantly interprets the poets and the verse of antiquity. (",
