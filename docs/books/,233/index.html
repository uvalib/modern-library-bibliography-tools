        "Cerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the ML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your Modern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to take with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE FURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the time the book was published, in your list [Scott’s 10-page pamphlet,",

        "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man",
        "and any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books in which a Dostoyefsky [",

        ", but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type which had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s audience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the cost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in production and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House between 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for books without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was cheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the possibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year or so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be instructed to melt the type (Harter,",

        "–",
        1939,
        ", pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult for reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive reprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial publication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from the original publisher’s plates."

The American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet Books—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight printings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies (Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on front cover)."
