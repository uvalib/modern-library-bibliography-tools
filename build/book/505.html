<p>Front flap:<br> This book is guaranteed to give you all fifty-seven varieties of laughter—everything from the side-splitting belly-laugh to the soft inner ripple.
These stories are all about Jeeves, the most fabulous gentleman’s gentleman ever invented. From behind his inscrutable facade, the incomparable Jeeves—confessor, savior, confidant—sagely guides the destinies of Bertie Wooster and his friends. And when things get out of hand, as they invariably do, it is Jeeves who tactfully assumes control to settle matters with his customary incredible ingenuity.
For this edition, John W. Aldridge has written an excellent introduction which discusses Wodehouse’s talent—a talent that transforms all readers into devotees. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection selected from <em>Carry On, Jeeves!</em> (George H. Doran Co., 1927) and <em>Very Good, Jeeves</em> (Doran, 1930). Published October 1958. <em>WR</em> 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Aldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be making new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that it would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to Aldridge, 19 July 1957).</p>
<p>Wodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he would be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in <em>Carry On, Jeeves!</em> were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML used most of the first Jeeves book and all of <em>Very Good, Jeeves</em>. He also suggested updating several references in the stories and changing the title to <em>A Gathering of Jeeves</em> (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August 1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked Wodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that he weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that for Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also asked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories. “Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period and . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary confusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent admirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title <em>Selected Stories</em>. “The latter [<em>A Gathering of Jeeves</em>] may sound a little bit better, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell best when they state very clearly what the book contains, without reaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August 1957).</p>
<p>Wodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared in <em>New World Writing</em>, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92.</p>

Spine in vivid red with lettering in reverse and black. \n\n> Front flap:<br> This book is guaranteed to give you all fifty-seven varieties of laughter—everything from the side-splitting belly-laugh to the soft inner ripple. \n> These stories are all about Jeeves, the most fabulous gentleman’s gentleman ever invented. From behind his inscrutable facade, the incomparable Jeeves—confessor, savior, confidant—sagely guides the destinies of Bertie Wooster and his friends. And when things get out of hand, as they invariably do, it is Jeeves who tactfully assumes control to settle matters with his customary incredible ingenuity. \n> For this edition, John W. Aldridge has written an excellent introduction which discusses Wodehouse’s talent—a talent that transforms all readers into devotees. (*Fall 1958*) \n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Carry On, Jeeves!* (George H. Doran Co., 1927) and *Very Good, Jeeves* (Doran, 1930). Published October 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\nAldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be making new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that it would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to Aldridge, 19 July 1957). \n\nWodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he would be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in *Carry On, Jeeves!* were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML used most of the first Jeeves book and all of *Very Good, Jeeves*. He also suggested updating several references in the stories and changing the title to *A Gathering of Jeeves* (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August 1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked Wodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that he weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that for Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also asked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories. “Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period and . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary confusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent admirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title *Selected Stories*. “The latter [*A Gathering of Jeeves*] may sound a little bit better, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell best when they state very clearly what the book contains, without reaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August 1957). \n\nWodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared in *New World Writing*, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92. \n\n",
