<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D with spelling of Dostoyevsky corrected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> In the whole literature of the subtle and mysterious relationship between man and the crimes he commits, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> stands supreme for its insight, its compassion and its psychological fidelity. The story of the murder committed by Raskolnikov, his punishment and atonement, is the most gripping and illuminating study ever written of a crime of repugnance and despair, and the consequences which arise inevitably from it. In Dostoyevsky’s mind, crime is its own punishment and retributive justice can never be as severe as the penalty the human soul can impose on itself. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. The plates were first used in 1944 for the Illustrated Modern Library edition (IML 10) and subsequently for regular ML printings.</p>
<p>Regular ML printings added part titles for Parts 1–6 and the Epilogue at the head of each part (Illustrated ML printings had separate leaves for part titles) and substituted new chapter numbers and large initial capitals at the beginning of each chapter for those used in Illustrated ML printings. Part titles, chapter numbers, and large initial capitals in Illustrated Modern Library printings were designed to be printed in gray and black; those in regular ML printings were printed in black only.</p>

<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. The ML invited Harry Levin and then Lionel Trilling to write the introduction. Both declined on the grounds that the $200 fee offered was inadequate (Erskine to Levin, 26 January 1950; Stein to Trilling, 3 February 1950; Trilling to Stein, 5 February 1950). At that point Stein telephoned Simmons, who had just accepted an invitation to write an introduction to <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> for $200, and he agreed to do <em>Crime and Punishment</em> instead.</p>

<p>*All ML editions used the spelling Dostoyevsky except <em>Best Short Stories</em> which uses the spelling Dostoevsky. In recent decades “Dostoevsky” has become the most common transliteration of the author’s name in English-language editions of his works. “Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821–1881” remains the “authorized form” used in library catalogs to collocate the nearly 50 variant spellings that have been used to represent the author’s name in the Roman alphabet (OCLC Authority Record Number 263592).</p>

(*Fall 1931*) *Note:* The author is misspelled “DOSTOYEVKSY” on the front panel and spine of the jacket. The earliest jacket with the spelling corrected has not been ascertained.  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D with spelling of Dostoyevsky corrected.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> In the whole literature of the subtle and mysterious relationship between man and the crimes he commits, *Crime and Punishment* stands supreme for its insight, its compassion and its psychological fidelity. The story of the murder committed by Raskolnikov, his punishment and atonement, is the most gripping and illuminating study ever written of a crime of repugnance and despair, and the consequences which arise inevitably from it. In Dostoyevsky’s mind, crime is its own punishment and retributive justice can never be as severe as the penalty the human soul can impose on itself. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\nGarnett translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1914. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published January 1932. *WR* 13 February 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. *Crime and Punishment* sold 16,923 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth best-selling title and the second best-selling title in the regular ML (*Of Human Bondage* was the best-selling title in the regular ML). It sold 10,943 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the fourth best-selling title in the regular ML. Sales through 1955 totaled 208,000 copies.\n\n#### 228.1b.

The plates were first used in 1944 for the Illustrated Modern Library edition (IML 10) and subsequently for regular ML printings.  \n\nRegular ML printings added part titles for Parts 1–6 and the Epilogue at the head of each part (Illustrated ML printings had separate leaves for part titles) and substituted new chapter numbers and large initial capitals at the beginning of each chapter for those used in Illustrated ML printings. Part titles, chapter numbers, and large initial capitals in Illustrated Modern Library printings were designed to be printed in gray and black; those in regular ML printings were printed in black only.  \n\n#### 228.2b.

The ML invited Harry Levin and then Lionel Trilling to write the introduction. Both declined on the grounds that the \\$200 fee offered was inadequate (Erskine to Levin, 26 January 1950; Stein to Trilling, 3 February 1950; Trilling to Stein, 5 February 1950). At that point Stein telephoned Simmons, who had just accepted an invitation to write an introduction to *The Brothers Karamazov* for \\$200, and he agreed to do *Crime and Punishment* instead.\n\n#### 228.3a.
