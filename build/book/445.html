<p>Pp. [i–iv] v–xiii [xiv], [1–2] 3–718 [719–722]. [1–23]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] COPYRIGHT, 1930, BY THE VIKING PRESS, INC. | <em>First</em> MODERN LIBRARY <em>Edition</em>, 1951; v–vii INTRODUCTION | <em>by</em> <span class="smallcaps">Christopher Morley</span>; [viii] blank; ix–xiii CONTENTS; [xiv] blank; [1] part title: Reginald | <em>First collected, 1904</em>; [2] acknowledgment; 3–633 text; [634] blank; [635] part title: Biography of Saki | BY | <span class="smallcaps">Ethel M.

<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> Pagination as 445a. [1]<sup>16</sup> [2–10]<sup>32</sup> [11]<sup>16</sup> [12]<sup>32</sup> [13]<sup>16</sup>. Contents as 445a except: [iv] COPYRIGHT, 1930, 1958, BY THE VIKING PRESS, INC.; [719–720] ML Giants list; [721–722] blank. (<em>Fall 1961</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> “There is no greater compliment to be paid the right kind of friend than to hand him Saki, without comment,” writes Christopher Morley in his Introduction to this volume. Hector Hugh Munro, perhaps the best-loved among English humorists and short-story writers, has endeared himself to all kinds of new friends since his death in action during World War One in 1916. The 135 stories in this book of over 700 pages, with the Biography by his sister, Ethel M. Munro, and the Introduction by Christopher Morley keep alive the grace and felicity and whimsical satire of the man who effaced himself in the pseudonym of Saki. (<em>Fall 1951</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1930. ML edition (pp. v–718) printed from Viking plates. Published fall 1951. <em>WR</em> 10 November 1951. First printing: 7,500 copies.</p>
<h4>445b. Title page with Fujita torchbearer; 7½ inch format (1969/70)</h4>
<p>Title as 445a through line 5; lines 6-7: [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/K.webp'>torchbearer K</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK.</p>
<p>Pagination, collation and contents as 445a variant. (<em>Spring 1967</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket A2:</em> Enlarged version of 445a jacket with background in pale yellow green (121) instead of bluish gray.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap with first paragraph adapted from first two sentences of 445a; second paragraph: <br> In his Introduction, Morley characterizes Saki’s style and wit as that of the “finest and driest of champagnes” blended with “the most elect of the still vintage wines.” It is this blend that has carried him through time to the present. The best of Saki’s short stories, collected together in this volume, coupled with the Biography by his sister and the Introduction by Christopher Morley, well deserves to be uncorked and savored until the last drop.</p>

Hector Hugh Munro, perhaps the best-loved among English humorists and short-story writers, has endeared himself to all kinds of new friends since his death in action during World War One in 1916. The 135 stories in this book of over 700 pages, with the Biography by his sister, Ethel M. Munro, and the Introduction by Christopher Morley keep alive the grace and felicity and whimsical satire of the man who effaced himself in the pseudonym of Saki.

The best of Saki’s short stories, collected together in this volume, coupled with the Biography by his sister and the Introduction by Christopher Morley, well deserves to be uncorked and savored until the last drop. \n\n#### 445c.
