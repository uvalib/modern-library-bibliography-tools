<p>Pp. [1–12] 13–310 [311–312]. [1–9]<sup>16</sup> [10]<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>[1] half title; [2] <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='publishers note' src='/mlb/images/notes/D5.webp'>pub. note D5</uvalib-modal-image-button>; [3] title; [4] <em>Copyright,</em> 1920, <em>by</em> JAMES HUNEKER | [short double rule] | <em>First Modern Library Edition</em> | 1930; [5] THE SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES; [6] blank; [7] text and epigraph; [8] blank; [9] text and epigraphs; [10] blank; [11] part title: THE FIRST GATE | <em>At the first gate, the warder stripped her; he took the</em> | <em>high tiara from her head . . .</em>; [12] blank; 13–310 text; [311–312] blank.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in strong red (12), dark gray (266) and black on cream paper depicting a kneeling woman in strong red with her face in her hand, casting a dark gray shadow; borders in strong red, lettering in black. Signed: [Irving] Politzer. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> A bright constellation of artists, dilettantes and voluptuaries made Bohemian New York a haven for the practitioners of all the deadly sins. Into their midst came Easter Brandès with her operatic ambitions and luminous beauty. A great Isolde, she had the morals of a soprano and the heart of a pawnbroker. <em>Painted Veils</em> is the story of her career as a singing harlot in a modern Babylon. It is told with the irrepressible mirth and flavor of that shrewd and ever-fascinating promenader among the seven arts— James Huneker. (<em>Spring 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1920. New bibliographical edition published by Horace Liveright, 1928. ML edition (pp. [5]–310) printed from 1928 Liveright plates with pp. [5] and [9] transposed. Published March 1930. <em>WR</em> 12 April 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1942.</p>
<p>The ML paid Liveright a $5,000 advance. <em>Painted Veils</em> was the ML’s best-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s <em>Sun Also Rises</em> (190) and Merejkowski’s <em>Romance of Leonardo da Vinci</em> (154). It continued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty best-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in September 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML printings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.</p>
<p>Shortly after <em>Painted Veils</em> was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith, the editor-in-chief of Boni &amp; Liveright, suggested a ML edition of Huneker’s autobiography <em>Steeplejack</em> (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930). Cerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you really think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no question that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to Smith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles Scribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker titles it published, such as <em>Essays</em>, selected and introduced by H. L. Mencken (1929) or <em>Steeplejack</em>. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s glory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern Library (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936). The ML edition of <em>Painted Veils</em> was discontinued six years later.</p>

Signed: [Irving] Politzer. (*Spring 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> A bright constellation of artists, dilettantes and voluptuaries made Bohemian New York a haven for the practitioners of all the deadly sins. Into their midst came Easter Brandès with her operatic ambitions and luminous beauty. A great Isolde, she had the morals of a soprano and the heart of a pawnbroker. *Painted Veils* is the story of her career as a singing harlot in a modern Babylon. It is told with the irrepressible mirth and flavor of that shrewd and ever-fascinating promenader among the seven arts— James Huneker. (*Spring 1936*)  \n\nOriginally published by Boni & Liveright, 1920. New bibliographical edition published by Horace Liveright, 1928. ML edition (pp. [5]–310) printed from 1928 Liveright plates with pp. [5] and [9] transposed. Published March 1930. *WR* 12 April 1930. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1942.  \n\nThe ML paid Liveright a \\$5,000 advance. *Painted Veils* was the ML’s best-selling title in 1930, followed by Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190) and Merejkowski’s *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci* (154). It continued to sell well but did not rank among the ML’s twenty best-selling titles during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in September 1930 and a third printing of 3,000 copies in March 1931. ML printings totaled 26,000 copies by September 1933.  \n\nShortly after *Painted Veils* was published, Thomas R. “Tommy” Smith, the editor-in-chief of Boni & Liveright, suggested a ML edition of Huneker’s autobiography *Steeplejack* (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1930). Cerf replied, “We are doing awfully well with Painted Veils, but do you really think that anything else of Huneker’s will sell well? There is no question that Steeplejack is a hell of a lot better book” (Cerf to Smith, 26 February 1931). Five years later Max Perkins of Charles Scribner’s Sons indicated that the ML could add any of the Huneker titles it published, such as *Essays*, selected and introduced by H. L. Mencken (1929) or *Steeplejack*. Cerf replied, “I am afraid Huneker’s glory has faded too much . . . to make him a good bet for the Modern Library (Perkins to Cerf, 10 July 1936; Cerf to Perkins, 15 July 1936). The ML edition of *Painted Veils* was discontinued six years later.  \n\n#### 192b.
