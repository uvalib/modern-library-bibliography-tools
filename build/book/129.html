<blockquote>
<p>Text on front: <br> THE AUTHOR: James Joyce is the Irish novelist whose epical satire “ULYSSES” has been hailed as the greatest product of the realistic movement in literature. THE BOOK:  “DUBLINERS” was written in 1905, and the author spent the next seven years trying to make his publisher live up to a contract to bring out the book. For the reader who has never sampled Joyce, “DUBLINERS” is an ideal introduction. (<em>Fall 1926</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “A book of representative stories by the author of ‘Ulysses,’ hailed as the greatest product of the realistic movement in literature.” (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> after the ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s decision, sustained afterward by the Court of Appeals, lends new importance to the Modern Library edition of <em>Dubliners</em>. This collection of short stories is definitely related to Joyce’s later work, in that many of its characters figure in the epical satire, <em>Ulysses</em>, and the autobiographical novel, <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> (Modern Library No. 145). By itself, <em>Dubliners</em> is a lasting contribution to the literature of the short story. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in London by Grant Richards, 1914; published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, using sheets of the first English edition. First American edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, published by Huebsch, April 1917. Huebsch merged with Viking Press in August 1925. ML edition (129.1, pp. [5]–288) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates. Publication announced for 25 November 1926. <em>WR</em> 1 January 1927. First printing: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>Dubliners</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 84th out of 147 ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in April 1927 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in July 1928. By April 1950 there had been twenty-eight printings for a total of 60,000 copies (Slocum and Cahoon, p. 17).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised: <br> The collection of fifteen stories under the title of <em>Dubliners</em> was James Joyce’s first published work in prose. Previously he had issued a book of verse, <em>Chamber Music</em>. These initial efforts were followed by <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> (Modern Library No. 145), the play <em>Exiles</em>, the modern epic <em>Ulysses</em> (Modern Library Giant G-52) and finally, <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. The tales in <em>Dubliners</em> are related to Joyce’s later work both in locale and in many of the characters who have a fuller development in <em>Ulysses</em>. By themselves these tales, written by Joyce in his early twenties, are a distinguished contribution to the literature of the short story and are an augury of the master work which was to follow.

<p>Following text added: <br> Joyce himself described these stories as a series of chapters in the moral history of his community. By themselves they bear the unmistakable stamp of Joyce’s genius and are an augury of the master works which were to follow.n This definitive edition of <em>Dubliners</em> is as near as possible to the version Joyce wanted to see published. The text has been prepared by Robert Scholes of the University of Iowa, in consultation with Richard Ellmann, Joyce’s biographer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corrected text originally published by Viking Press, 1967. ML edition (pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published spring 1969 at $2.45.</p>
<p>The statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text . . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the corrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate dialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition published by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American edition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American printings before 1967—used quotation marks.</p>
<p>Printings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½ inch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in 1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼ inch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the taller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely redesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼ inch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch format. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings. The ISBN <a href="callto:+1394-6012">394-6012 </a>4-6 (without the initial 0) was added to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets for previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is probably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain endpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were characteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the remainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front endpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as the 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to understand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to the 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger format.</p>
<p>There appears to have been a gap of several years between the discontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.</p>

THE BOOK:  “DUBLINERS” was written in 1905, and the author spent the next seven years trying to make his publisher live up to a contract to bring out the book. For the reader who has never sampled Joyce, “DUBLINERS” is an ideal introduction. (*Fall 1926*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “A book of representative stories by the author of ‘Ulysses,’ hailed as the greatest product of the realistic movement in literature.” (*Fall 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> The publication by Random House of James Joyce’s *Ulysses* after the ban had been lifted by Judge John M. Woolsey’s decision, sustained afterward by the Court of Appeals, lends new importance to the Modern Library edition of *Dubliners*. This collection of short stories is definitely related to Joyce’s later work, in that many of its characters figure in the epical satire, *Ulysses*, and the autobiographical novel, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (Modern Library No. 145). By itself, *Dubliners* is a lasting contribution to the literature of the short story. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published in London by Grant Richards, 1914; published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1916, using sheets of the first English edition. First American edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, published by Huebsch, April 1917. Huebsch merged with Viking Press in August 1925. ML edition (129.1, pp. [5]–288) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates. Publication announced for 25 November 1926. *WR* 1 January 1927. First printing: 5,000 copies.  \n\nSales of *Dubliners* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 84th out of 147 ML titles. There was a second printing of 3,000 copies in April 1927 and a third printing of 2,000 copies in July 1928. By April 1950 there had been twenty-eight printings for a total of 60,000 copies (Slocum and Cahoon, p. 17).  \n\n#### 129.1b.

(*Spring 1946*).  \n\n> Front flap revised: <br> The collection of fifteen stories under the title of *Dubliners* was James Joyce’s first published work in prose. Previously he had issued a book of verse, *Chamber Music*. These initial efforts were followed by *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (Modern Library No. 145), the play *Exiles*, the modern epic *Ulysses* (Modern Library Giant G-52) and finally, *Finnegans Wake*. The tales in *Dubliners* are related to Joyce’s later work both in locale and in many of the characters who have a fuller development in *Ulysses*. By themselves these tales, written by Joyce in his early twenties, are a distinguished contribution to the literature of the short story and are an augury of the master work which was to follow. (*Fall 1953*)  \n\n*Jacket C:* As jacket B except on coated white paper with background in strong blue (178) and rules in strong yellow green (117). \n\n> Front flap as jacket B revised text.

Statement on front: “The Definitive Text restoring Joyce’s manuscript style and his later corrections”. \n\n> Front flap: <br> First four sentences as 129.1b jacket B revised text except references to ML numbers and words “the modern epic” describing *Ulysses* omitted.  \n\n> Following text added: <br> Joyce himself described these stories as a series of chapters in the moral history of his community. By themselves they bear the unmistakable stamp of Joyce’s genius and are an augury of the master works which were to follow.n This definitive edition of *Dubliners* is as near as possible to the version Joyce wanted to see published. The text has been prepared by Robert Scholes of the University of Iowa, in consultation with Richard Ellmann, Joyce’s biographer.  \n\nCorrected text originally published by Viking Press, 1967. ML edition (pp. 5–224) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Viking edition. Published spring 1969 at \\$2.45.  \n\nThe statement “First Modern Library Edition, 1969, with corrected text . . .” is retained on all printings of 129.2. Among other changes the corrected text follows Joyce’s preference for initial dashes to indicate dialogue in place of quotation marks. The original English edition published by Grant Richards in December 1914 and the first American edition published by Huebsch in 1917—and all subsequent American printings before 1967—used quotation marks.  \n\nPrintings of 129.2a exist in both the 7¼ and 7½ inch formats. The 7½ inch format superseded the 7¼ inch format for newly added ML titles in 1969. Printings of many earlier titles continued to appear in the 7¼ inch format because of the time it took to adapt older jackets to the taller format. The first ML printing of 129.2a, despite being completely redesigned and printed from new plates, appears to have been in the 7¼ inch format. There was at least one early printing in the 7½ inch format. The 7¼ inch format was used for the final printing or printings. The ISBN [394-6012 ](callto:+1394-6012)4-6 (without the initial 0) was added to the back panel of a 7¼ inch jacket in the early 1970s; jackets for previous printings of 129.2a in both formats lack the ISBN. What is probably the last printing in the 7¼ inch format has been seen in plain endpapers instead of Fujita’s decorated endpaper. Plain endpapers were characteristic of late printings in the 1970s; some copies have the remainder mark of a large reddish purple “H” stamped on the front endpaper. Conclusive evidence in support of the 7¼ or 7½ inch format as the 1969 first printing has not been established, but it is difficult to understand why late printings would switch, perhaps inadvertently, to the 7¼ inch format if all previous printings had been in the larger format.  \n\nThere appears to have been a gap of several years between the discontinuation of 129.2a and the publication of 129.2b.  \n\n#### 129.2b.
