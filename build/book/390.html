<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> In response to an ever-increasing number of written suggestions that there be a larger representation of the novels of Balzac in the Modern Library, the editors have chosen for inclusion in the series two of his most famous works of fiction: <em>Père Goriot</em> and <em>Eugénie Grandet</em>. In brand-new translations, the first by E. K. Brown of Chicago University, and the second by Dorothea Walter and John Watkins, this portion of the massive structure of the Human Comedy belongs among the world’s greatest novels of creative imagination and social criticism. (<em>Fall 1946</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML translations. Publication announced for September 1946. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>E. K. Brown of Cornell University suggested that the ML needed a volume of Balzac in addition to <em>Droll Stories</em> (221), which he considered unrepresentative. “You have Stendhal, Flaubert and Maupassant, why not Balzac?” (Brown to Cerf, 26 March 1943). Cerf commissioned him to modernize existing English translations of <em>Père Goriot</em> and <em>Eugénie Grandet</em> and to write an introduction. Brown agreed to a fee of $300 and promised the manuscript within five months (Cerf to Brown, 25 August 1943). Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the Balzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the library which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four months later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were needed (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the existing translations were probably very bad and favored doing new translations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we pay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to advertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February 1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should tell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this point Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown, 10 February 1944).</p>
<p>Brown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed work on the translation of <em>Eugénie Grandet</em>. In December he suggested John Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4 December 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent $300 each to Brown and Watkins. The financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and Brown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that $500 would be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he initially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being unreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually accepted the $300 fee.</p>
<p><em>Père Goriot &amp; Eugénie Grandet</em> did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Published initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML.</p>
<p>Stein offered Brown $50 to add a one-page summary of Balzac’s life and a short bibliography to the introduction (Stein to Brown, 27 January 1950). Brown inserted three paragraphs of biographical information after the opening paragraph of the introduction. The additions to the introduction extended its length by a page, and the bibliography occupied an additional two pages. By using the blank page that followed the introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96 occupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to incorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length of the volume. The title page was completely reset, and Brown’s introduction was credited for the first time on the title page.</p>
<p>Brown also supplied a list of errors and misprints that appeared on eight pages of the text. The plates were patched to correct the errors.</p>

Signed: “brenner” at upper right. \n\n> Front flap:<br> In response to an ever-increasing number of written suggestions that there be a larger representation of the novels of Balzac in the Modern Library, the editors have chosen for inclusion in the series two of his most famous works of fiction: *Père Goriot* and *Eugénie Grandet*. In brand-new translations, the first by E. K. Brown of Chicago University, and the second by Dorothea Walter and John Watkins, this portion of the massive structure of the Human Comedy belongs among the world’s greatest novels of creative imagination and social criticism. (*Fall 1946*) \n\nOriginal ML translations. Publication announced for September 1946. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nE. K. Brown of Cornell University suggested that the ML needed a volume of Balzac in addition to *Droll Stories* (221), which he considered unrepresentative. “You have Stendhal, Flaubert and Maupassant, why not Balzac?” (Brown to Cerf, 26 March 1943). Cerf commissioned him to modernize existing English translations of *Père Goriot* and *Eugénie Grandet* and to write an introduction. Brown agreed to a fee of \\$300 and promised the manuscript within five months (Cerf to Brown, 25 August 1943). Brown commented, “I think it very good of you to agree to the Balzac addition in the face of the figures on the French books in the library which you showed to me” (Brown to Cerf, 2 September 1943). Four months later Brown informed Cerf that entirely new translations were needed (Brown to Cerf, 8 January 1944). Commins acknowledged that the existing translations were probably very bad and favored doing new translations if the cost was not prohibitive. He noted, “Whatever we pay, within reason, will be worth the money, just to be able to advertise an entirely new translation” (Commins memo to Cerf, 9 February 1944). Cerf authorized Brown to go ahead and indicated that he should tell him what a fair price for the new translations would be. At this point Cerf was hoping for a spring 1945 publication date (Cerf to Brown, 10 February 1944). \n\nBrown’s move to the University of Chicago in the summer of 1944 delayed work on the translation of *Eugénie Grandet*. In December he suggested John Watkins as a translator for the second work (Brown to Cerf, 4 December 1944). In May 1945 the ML sent \\$300 each to Brown and Watkins. The financial arrangements appear not to have been settled earlier, and Brown was expecting more. He returned the check and indicated that \\$500 would be a more appropriate fee. Cerf, who was paying twice what he initially offered for revised translations, thought that Brown was being unreasonable and responded with an angry letter. Brown eventually accepted the \\$300 fee. \n\n*Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet* did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n#### 390b.

Brown, Dorothea Walter, and John Watkins* | *With an introduction by E. K. Brown,* | *Professor of English, University of Chicago* | [torchbearer E5] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | *NEW YORK* \n\nPp.

(*Fall 1961 jacket*) *Note:* Battered page numeral “xvi” removed from plates. \n\n*Jacket:* As 390a. (*Spring 1958*) \n\nPublished initially in MLCE and shortly thereafter in the regular ML. \n\nStein offered Brown \\$50 to add a one-page summary of Balzac’s life and a short bibliography to the introduction (Stein to Brown, 27 January 1950). Brown inserted three paragraphs of biographical information after the opening paragraph of the introduction. The additions to the introduction extended its length by a page, and the bibliography occupied an additional two pages. By using the blank page that followed the introduction in 390a and shifting Balzac’s text so that pp. 495–96 occupied the blank leaf at the end of 390a, the ML was able to incorporate three additional pages of text without increasing the length of the volume. The title page was completely reset, and Brown’s introduction was credited for the first time on the title page. \n\nBrown also supplied a list of errors and misprints that appeared on eight pages of the text. The plates were patched to correct the errors. \n\n",
