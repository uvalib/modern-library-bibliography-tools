<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Jacket title: THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform philosophy jacket. Jacket title: THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> The philosopher of idealism, Plato remains the spokesman for all those who are perennially young in their love of wisdom and their curiosity about the mysteries of the human soul. The poetic charm and the dramatic suggestiveness of his writings lend persuasion to Plato’s central theme—the clarification and harmonizing of life by reason. Under the brilliant editorship of Irwin Edman, the Modern Library edition of <em>The Philosophy of Plato</em>, in the Jewett Translation, is the most comprehensive collection of Plato’s works issued in a single volume. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in strong yellowish pink 26), silver and black on coated cream paper with drawing of Plato on inset silver circle and lettering in black, all on panel in strong yellowish pink with borders in silver. Jacket title: THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO. Statement at foot of front panel: EDITED BY IRWIN EDMAN | The JOWETT Translation, edited and with an | introduction by <span class="smallcaps">Irwin Edman</span>. Front flap as jacket B. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
<p>Edman’s edition of <em>The Works of Plato</em> was originally published by Simon and Schuster, 1928. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1930. <em>WR</em> 29 November 1930. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Edman’s selection included ten dialogues from the third edition of <em>The Dialogues of Plato</em>, translated into English with introductions and analyses by B. Jowett (5 vols., Oxford University Press, 1892). Edman omitted Jowett’s lengthy introductions and analyses, but the Simon and Schuster edition retains Jowett’s marginal notes. Fourteen dialogues were omitted. Simon and Schuster used the word “abridged” on the title page; the ML title page, which indicates that the volume was “selected and edited” by Edman, was clearer and more accurate.</p>
<p>The Simon and Schuster plates were too wide for the ML’s format. The ML reset the entire work, omitting the marginal notes. The ML paid Simon and Schuster royalties of 7 cents a copy, of which Edman appears to have received 5 cents.</p>
<p><em>The Works of Plato</em> sold 10,848 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the 26th best-selling title in the ML. Sales were even better in the early 1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s eighth best-selling title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front and back flaps:  <br> “. . . in these writings, unique at once in the history of literature and the history of philosophy, [the reader] meets thought whose medium is not dogma but drama, drama among whose chief excitements are the subtle suspenses of thought. . . . The ‘philosophy’ of Plato is clearly not a philosophy of the schools; his drama is profounder in theme and more comprehensive in range than the constricted little toys of the stage. For those who have not learned with Plato that philosophy is the love of wisdom rather than the pronouncement of truth, there is considerable mystification in a thinker whose thoughts are all suggestions, whose suggestions are often playful, and who will not, despite the attempt of more than one serious critic, be crammed into a neat and lifeless system. The reader is haunted, too, by the perturbed sense that, though these dialogues are full of endless charm as poetic and ironic drama, they are clearly more than the by-play of a gifted writer. The further one reads the more deeply does one come into the presence of the profoundest and most serious issues of human existence. What on its winning surface is the spirited conversation between Socrates and a group of attractive young Athenian aristocrats, closely read, stirs one profoundly to a consideration of the nature of good and evil, of reality, of the paramount mystery of the human soul.” —<em>from the Introduction by Irwin Edman</em></p>

Jacket title: THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO.  \n\n> Front flap: <br> The philosopher of idealism, Plato remains the spokesman for all those who are perennially young in their love of wisdom and their curiosity about the mysteries of the human soul. The poetic charm and the dramatic suggestiveness of his writings lend persuasion to Plato’s central theme—the clarification and harmonizing of life by reason. Under the brilliant editorship of Irwin Edman, the Modern Library edition of *The Philosophy of Plato*, in the Jewett Translation, is the most comprehensive collection of Plato’s works issued in a single volume. (*Fall 1935*)  \n\n*Jacket C:* Pictorial in strong yellowish pink 26), silver and black on coated cream paper with drawing of Plato on inset silver circle and lettering in black, all on panel in strong yellowish pink with borders in silver. Jacket title: THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO. Statement at foot of front panel: EDITED BY IRWIN EDMAN | The JOWETT Translation, edited and with an | introduction by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Irwin Edman</span>. Front flap as jacket B. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nEdman’s edition of *The Works of Plato* was originally published by Simon and Schuster, 1928. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published November 1930. *WR* 29 November 1930. First printing: Not ascertained.  \n\nEdman’s selection included ten dialogues from the third edition of *The Dialogues of Plato*, translated into English with introductions and analyses by B. Jowett (5 vols., Oxford University Press, 1892). Edman omitted Jowett’s lengthy introductions and analyses, but the Simon and Schuster edition retains Jowett’s marginal notes. Fourteen dialogues were omitted. Simon and Schuster used the word “abridged” on the title page; the ML title page, which indicates that the volume was “selected and edited” by Edman, was clearer and more accurate.  \n\nThe Simon and Schuster plates were too wide for the ML’s format. The ML reset the entire work, omitting the marginal notes. The ML paid Simon and Schuster royalties of 7 cents a copy, of which Edman appears to have received 5 cents.  \n\n*The Works of Plato* sold 10,848 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the 26th best-selling title in the ML. Sales were even better in the early 1950s. During the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952 it was the ML’s eighth best-selling title.  \n\n#### 204b.

This was the first 204 jacket to record the title as it appeared on the title page and binding.  \n\n> Front and back flaps:  <br> “. . . in these writings, unique at once in the history of literature and the history of philosophy, [the reader] meets thought whose medium is not dogma but drama, drama among whose chief excitements are the subtle suspenses of thought. . . . The ‘philosophy’ of Plato is clearly not a philosophy of the schools; his drama is profounder in theme and more comprehensive in range than the constricted little toys of the stage. For those who have not learned with Plato that philosophy is the love of wisdom rather than the pronouncement of truth, there is considerable mystification in a thinker whose thoughts are all suggestions, whose suggestions are often playful, and who will not, despite the attempt of more than one serious critic, be crammed into a neat and lifeless system. The reader is haunted, too, by the perturbed sense that, though these dialogues are full of endless charm as poetic and ironic drama, they are clearly more than the by-play of a gifted writer. The further one reads the more deeply does one come into the presence of the profoundest and most serious issues of human existence. What on its winning surface is the spirited conversation between Socrates and a group of attractive young Athenian aristocrats, closely read, stirs one profoundly to a consideration of the nature of good and evil, of reality, of the paramount mystery of the human soul.” —*from the Introduction by Irwin Edman*  \n\n#### 204d.
