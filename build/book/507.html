Frank</em> | <em>Copyright, 1952, by the American Jewish Committee</em>; [5] pub. note; [6] blank; 7–8 INTRODUCTION signed p. 8: ELEANOR ROOSEVELT; [9] facsimile of handwritten entry in diary signed: [in script] Anne Frank. 12 Juni 1942.; [10] blank; 11–283 text; [284] blank; 285 <em>EPILOGUE</em>; [286] blank; [287–288] ML Giants list.

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in grayish olive green (127), brilliant yellow (83) and black on coated white paper with illustration in grayish olive green and black of a young woman viewed from the rear, wearing an armband with a Star of David in brilliant yellow; lettering in grayish olive green and black, all against white background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> “I hope I shall be able to confide in you completely,” Anne Frank wrote on the opening page of her diary, “as I have never been able to do in anyone before, and I hope that you will be a great support and comfort to me.”
What follows is the story of an experience told with such sensitivity and warmth that no reader finishes the book without resolving to read it again.
Anne Frank, her sister, and her parents, along with four others, shared a small hiding place in an old building in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation. Her vivid account of their experiences and feelings during the two fearful years before their discovery—written with rare insight, humor, and intimacy—is one of the classics of our times. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Anne Frank was born in Frankfort, Germany on June 12, 1929. “As we are Jewish, we emigrated to Holland in 1933,” Anne writes in her diary, which she received on her thirteenth birthday. In July 1942 she and her family were forced to take refuge with four others in a back apartment in Amsterdam. There they remained until August 4, 1944, when the <em>Grüne Polizei</em> made a raid on the “Secret Annexe” and all the occupants were arrested and sent to German and Dutch concentration camps. In March 1945, two months before the liberation of Holland, Anne died of typhoid in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Only her father, Otto Frank, survived, and it was he who saw that Anne’s diary was published in 1947.
Written with rare insight, humor and intimacy, <em>The Diary of a Young Girl</em> is one of the classics of our time. It has inspired a play and has been a bestseller in almost every known language. To hundreds of thousands of people, it represents the true horror and tragedy of the Nazi Occupation.</p>

Frank* | *Copyright, 1952, by the American Jewish Committee*; [5] pub. note; [6] blank; 7–8 INTRODUCTION signed p. 8: ELEANOR ROOSEVELT; [9] facsimile of handwritten entry in diary signed: [in script] Anne Frank. 12 Juni 1942.; [10] blank; 11–283 text; [284] blank; 285 *EPILOGUE*; [286] blank; [287–288] ML Giants list. (*Fall 1958*) \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in grayish olive green (127), brilliant yellow (83) and black on coated white paper with illustration in grayish olive green and black of a young woman viewed from the rear, wearing an armband with a Star of David in brilliant yellow; lettering in grayish olive green and black, all against white background. \n\n> Front flap:<br> “I hope I shall be able to confide in you completely,” Anne Frank wrote on the opening page of her diary, “as I have never been able to do in anyone before, and I hope that you will be a great support and comfort to me.” \n> What follows is the story of an experience told with such sensitivity and warmth that no reader finishes the book without resolving to read it again. \n> Anne Frank, her sister, and her parents, along with four others, shared a small hiding place in an old building in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation. Her vivid account of their experiences and feelings during the two fearful years before their discovery—written with rare insight, humor, and intimacy—is one of the classics of our times.

In July 1942 she and her family were forced to take refuge with four others in a back apartment in Amsterdam. There they remained until August 4, 1944, when the *Grüne Polizei* made a raid on the “Secret Annexe” and all the occupants were arrested and sent to German and Dutch concentration camps. In March 1945, two months before the liberation of Holland, Anne died of typhoid in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Only her father, Otto Frank, survived, and it was he who saw that Anne’s diary was published in 1947. \n> Written with rare insight, humor and intimacy, *The Diary of a Young Girl* is one of the classics of our time. It has inspired a play and has been a bestseller in almost every known language. To hundreds of thousands of people, it represents the true horror and tragedy of the Nazi Occupation. \n\nPublished spring 1978 at \\$4.95. ISBN 0-394-60451-2. \n\n",
