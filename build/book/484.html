<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Bernard Shaw has been called “the liveliest and, in many ways, the youngest intellect of the century.” This estimate is fully supported by the three “problem” plays in this volume:
SAINT JOAN, a searching portrayal of Joan of Arc—one of Shaw’s greatest successes in the theatre,
MAJOR BARBARA, a devastating indictment of insincere philanthropy—regarded by some critics as one of Shaw’s finest works,
ANDROCLES AND THE LION, a brilliant exploration of the varieties of faith—a perennial favorite of Shaw admirers.
Often disconcerting and irreverent, Shaw never fails to be thought-provoking in his charmingly witty way. The Modern Library takes pride in adding these plays to those already available in <em>Four Plays by Bernard Shaw</em> (ML 10). (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> George Bernard Shaw has been hailed as the greatest British dramatist since Shakespeare, and this volume contains three of his most highly regarded—and most frequently revived—plays.
<em>Saint Joan</em>, Shaw’s ironic study of Joan of Arc as a woman who had to be killed because the world was not yet ready for a saint, is considered by many to be his best play and has a title role that continues to challenge leading actresses.
<em>Major Barbara</em>, the story of the daughter of a wealthy munitions manufacturer who joins the Salvation Army to defy her father, preaches the still timely lesson that poverty is the root of all evil.
<em>Androcles and the Lion</em> is an unexpectedly hilarious, if biting, satire on the early Christians.</p>
