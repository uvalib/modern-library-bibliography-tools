<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> “Armed both with science and satiric humor, Veblen exposes, with a ferocity like Swift’s and with incomparably larger understanding, the dominion throughout all our moral and aesthetic world of judgments resting on the rivalrous display of wealth. To my mind the protest against false values contained in this book, is one of the landmarks in the life of reason.” —MAX EASTMAN. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br> The influence of Thorstein Veblen’s <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em> has grown immeasurably in the half century since its original publication. Some of its phrases—notably “conspicuous consumption”—have become standard in our national vocabulary. His examination of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on pecuniary culture is one of the masterly analyses and critiques of our socio-economic development. Its irony, its rich accumulation of evidence and, above all, its boldness of interpretation have kept it a vital work through years of social upheaval, economic disequilibrium and an altogether unstable period of national and world history.

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Since its original publication <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em> has become a classic in its field, both for its economic analysis and for its perspective on social values in America.
Some of its phrases—notably “conspicuous consumption”—have become standard in our national vocabulary. Veblen’s examination of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on pecuniary culture is one of the masterly critiques of our socio-economic development. The new point of view and method elaborated by Veblen riddled the whole structure of economics as a pseudo-social science and created instead an entirely original set of economic categories, based on changing industrial conditions rather than an inflexible system formulated from so-called eternal principles.
Its irony, its rich accumulation of evidence and, above all, its boldness of interpretation have kept <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em> a vital work through the years.</p>

To my mind the protest against false values contained in this book, is one of the landmarks in the life of reason.” —MAX EASTMAN. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by the Macmillan Co., 1899; reprinted with the addition of an index, 1912; subsequently published by B. W. Huebsch, 1918, and Viking Press, 1931. ML edition (274.1, pp. vii–x, 1–404) printed from Macmillan/Huebsch/Viking plates with preliminaries repaginated for the ML edition, last line of p. vii shifted from the second page of the preface, and table of contents revised to reflect the addition of Chase’s foreword. Published September 1934. *WR* 29 September 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\n*The Theory of the Leisure Class* sold 7,807 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.

(*Spring 1942*)  \n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br> The influence of Thorstein Veblen’s *The Theory of the Leisure Class* has grown immeasurably in the half century since its original publication. Some of its phrases—notably “conspicuous consumption”—have become standard in our national vocabulary. His examination of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on pecuniary culture is one of the masterly analyses and critiques of our socio-economic development. Its irony, its rich accumulation of evidence and, above all, its boldness of interpretation have kept it a vital work through years of social upheaval, economic disequilibrium and an altogether unstable period of national and world history.

Veblen’s examination of the leisure class as an economic factor in modern life and its emphasis on pecuniary culture is one of the masterly critiques of our socio-economic development. The new point of view and method elaborated by Veblen riddled the whole structure of economics as a pseudo-social science and created instead an entirely original set of economic categories, based on changing industrial conditions rather than an inflexible system formulated from so-called eternal principles. \n> Its irony, its rich accumulation of evidence and, above all, its boldness of interpretation have kept *The Theory of the Leisure Class* a vital work through the years.  \n\n",
