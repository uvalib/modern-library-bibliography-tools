<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The response by Dickens enthusiasts to the two titles already in the Modern Library series . . . persuaded the editors to include the famous historical-imaginative novel, <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>, in a completely new edition. In the three-quarters of a century since its first appearance, this story of the French Revolution has maintained its popularity generation after generation with readers the world over. The widespread revival of interest in the works of Charles Dickens made the reissue of <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> inevitable and imperative. (<em>Fall 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br> It is now almost a full century since <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> was published, yet it still stands as one of the best of all the historical novels written during that time. New generations of readers have obtained their first understanding of the meaning of the French Revolution as a social cataclysm and a human drama from the pages of this novel. They have participated in its blood-stirring events not by following the career of notable and spectacular personages, but by identifying themselves with Sydney Carton, the Defarges and the other obscure people who lived and died during the reign of terror. (<em>Fall 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial on coated white paper with multicolored illustration of a public execution with the severed head of a guillotined man being held aloft to a crowd of soldiers and others; lettering in black.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap as jacket A rewritten text. (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wagenknecht received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Wagenknecht, 24 January 1950). Despite the addition of the new introduction and bibliography, the number of leaves is identical to 284b. This was accomplished by omitting the biographical note (which was superseded by the new introduction), the first part title (which was added at the head of chapter 1 and mysteriously appears as well at the head of the title page), and the ML lists at the end of the book. In addition, pp. 395–96 were adjusted with minor resetting to accommodate the last three lines of text that appeared on p. 397 in earlier printings.</p>
