<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The author of the <em>Comédie Humaine</em> spreads a feast for readers of robust appetite. The fare he offers is rich in flavor and as spicy as the French life and manners of the sixteenth century which he chronicles in these pages. The gayest wags, the most illustrious guzzlers and the most abashed cuckolds of the age are gathered here to entertain you. Partake of their vigor and merriment without stint or squeamishness. Be prepared for unashamed laughter at the healthy ribaldry of these <em>Droll Stories</em>. (<em>Fall 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>English translation by George Robert Sims originally published in London, 1874. Early editions did not identify the translator, and the ML edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, did not identify the translator either. Published October 1931. <em>WR</em> 7 November 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The translator states that “although <em>Les Cent Contes Drolatiques</em> were completed and published in 1837, the present is the first English version ever brought before the public” (Translator’s Preface, p. xi). Klopfer was unaware of the translator’s identity. He noted, “The book isn’t copyrighted in this country, but I cannot tell you who did the translation. It is passable” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, John Lane, The Bodley Head, 20 October 1931).</p>
<p>The ML’s plates were also used for printings by Walter J. Black, Blue Ribbon Books, and Carlton House.</p>

The fare he offers is rich in flavor and as spicy as the French life and manners of the sixteenth century which he chronicles in these pages.

Klopfer was unaware of the translator’s identity. He noted, “The book isn’t copyrighted in this country, but I cannot tell you who did the translation. It is passable” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, John Lane, The Bodley Head, 20 October 1931).  \n\nThe ML’s plates were also used for printings by Walter J.
