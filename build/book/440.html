<blockquote>
<p>Front flap as 94.1e: <br> For more than three-quarters of a century Walt Whitman has stood unique among the poets of the world. Publication of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1855 marked the emergence upon the world scene of one of America’s most noteworthy personalities. His poetry, at once the most intensely personal in literature and of the most pervasive influence, has taken its place among the sublime utterances of man. Appropriately, the introduction to the Modern Library edition of the complete <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was written by Walt Whitman’s most distinguished American disciple, Carl Sandburg. (<em>Spring 1951; Spring 1953</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A</em> with front flap rewritten: <br> More than almost any other literary classic, Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is not only a work of art but the capturing in print of the turbulence and tenderness of a poet’s personality. Whitman himself, conscious that <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was his own great monument, never ceased revising, polishing and adding to it, so that he could truly say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is no book, Who touches this book touches a man.” The present edition by Professor John Kouwenhoven of Barnard College reprints the excellent and authoritative “deathbed edition” of 1892, to which has been added the posthumously published “Old Age Echoes” and a generous selection of prose, including all of <em>Specimen Days</em>. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in light olive (106), strong reddish brown (40) and black on coated white paper with right profile drawing of olive panel at left; lettering in strong reddish brown, light olive and black on wider white panel at right; “Walt Whitman” in black script across both panels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap as jacket A, rewritten text. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (94). Published spring 1951 in the regular ML. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (94) was on the first list of titles scheduled for MLCE. Kouwenhoven indicated that the ML needed a thoroughly revised volume of Whitman’s writings when Stein invited him to write a new introduction for the College Edition. Stein agreed and offered him a flat fee of $250 to select and edit the text and write the introduction, noting that the new edition would assure the ML of “a book considerably more desirable than that offered by any competitors, not only in terms of quantity of material but in terms of the more complete picture it gives of Whitman himself” (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 25 January 1950; 5 April 1950; 10 April 1950). Stein sent Kouwenhoven an additional $100 when <em>Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose</em> was added to the regular ML (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 28 June 1951).</p>
<p>The 94.2 jacket with its outdated flap reference to Carl Sandburg’s introduction remained in use through 1953. The flap text was revised in spring 1954. ML catalogs began to list the title as <em>Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose</em> in spring 1954; ML lists inside the jackets and at the end of ML volumes continued to list it as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.</p>
<p>Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was one of four works that were published in the regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included in all three series were Cervantes, <em>Don Quixote</em> (1930: 197), Giant (1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Dostoyevsky, <em>Brothers Karamazov</em> (1929: 171), Giant (1937: G34), Illus ML (1943: IML 2); Fielding, <em>History of Tom Jones</em> (1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943: IML 5).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap as 440a jacket B with minor stylistic revisions and first sentence revised:  <br> More than almost any other literary classic, Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is not only a work of art; it captures in print the unique personality of a poet as well as an aspect of the American consciousness. Whitman himself, aware that <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was his own great monument, never ceased revising, polishing and adding to it, so that he could truly say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is no book, Who touches this book touches a man.” This edition, edited by John Kouwenhoven, reprints the excellent and authoritative “deathbed edition” of 1892, to which has been added the posthumously published “Old Age Echoes” and a generous selection of prose, including all of <em>Specimen Days</em>.</p>

Preface, 1855 Edition – Democratic Vistas – Preface to “As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free” – Preface to Centennial Edition – Poetry To-day in America – Shakespeare – The Future – A Backward Glance O’er Travel’d Roads – Specimen Days. \n\n*Jacket A* as 94.2 jacket: Pictorial in dark olive green (126), grayish yellow green (122), moderate brown (58), pale yellowish pink (31) and black on coated white paper with inset illustration of an American eagle with an olive branch and arrows in its claws flying over sea and pale yellowish pink cliffs; title in grayish yellow green, author in reverse, series in black, all against dark olive green background. Designed by Warren Chappell; unsigned. \n\n> Front flap as 94.1e: <br> For more than three-quarters of a century Walt Whitman has stood unique among the poets of the world. Publication of *Leaves of Grass* in 1855 marked the emergence upon the world scene of one of America’s most noteworthy personalities. His poetry, at once the most intensely personal in literature and of the most pervasive influence, has taken its place among the sublime utterances of man. Appropriately, the introduction to the Modern Library edition of the complete *Leaves of Grass* was written by Walt Whitman’s most distinguished American disciple, Carl Sandburg. (*Spring 1951; Spring 1953*) \n\n> *Jacket A* with front flap rewritten: <br> More than almost any other literary classic, Walt Whitman’s *Leaves of Grass* is not only a work of art but the capturing in print of the turbulence and tenderness of a poet’s personality. Whitman himself, conscious that *Leaves of Grass* was his own great monument, never ceased revising, polishing and adding to it, so that he could truly say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is no book, Who touches this book touches a man.” The present edition by Professor John Kouwenhoven of Barnard College reprints the excellent and authoritative “deathbed edition” of 1892, to which has been added the posthumously published “Old Age Echoes” and a generous selection of prose, including all of *Specimen Days*. (*Spring 1954*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in light olive (106), strong reddish brown (40) and black on coated white paper with right profile drawing of olive panel at left; lettering in strong reddish brown, light olive and black on wider white panel at right; “Walt Whitman” in black script across both panels. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A, rewritten text. (*Fall 1958*) \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding Whitman’s *Leaves of Grass* (94). Published spring 1951 in the regular ML. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; retained in MLCE. \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. *Leaves of Grass* (94) was on the first list of titles scheduled for MLCE. Kouwenhoven indicated that the ML needed a thoroughly revised volume of Whitman’s writings when Stein invited him to write a new introduction for the College Edition. Stein agreed and offered him a flat fee of \\$250 to select and edit the text and write the introduction, noting that the new edition would assure the ML of “a book considerably more desirable than that offered by any competitors, not only in terms of quantity of material but in terms of the more complete picture it gives of Whitman himself” (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 25 January 1950; 5 April 1950; 10 April 1950). Stein sent Kouwenhoven an additional \\$100 when *Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose* was added to the regular ML (Stein to Kouwenhoven, 28 June 1951). \n\nThe 94.2 jacket with its outdated flap reference to Carl Sandburg’s introduction remained in use through 1953. The flap text was revised in spring 1954. ML catalogs began to list the title as *Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose* in spring 1954; ML lists inside the jackets and at the end of ML volumes continued to list it as *Leaves of Grass*. \n\nWhitman’s *Leaves of Grass* was one of four works that were published in the regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included in all three series were Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (1930: 197), Giant (1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* (1929: 171), Giant (1937: G34), Illus ML (1943: IML 2); Fielding, *History of Tom Jones* (1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943: IML 5). \n\n#### 440b.

Whitman himself, aware that *Leaves of Grass* was his own great monument, never ceased revising, polishing and adding to it, so that he could truly say to readers of all times, “Camerado, this is no book, Who touches this book touches a man.” This edition, edited by John Kouwenhoven, reprints the excellent and authoritative “deathbed edition” of 1892, to which has been added the posthumously published “Old Age Echoes” and a generous selection of prose, including all of *Specimen Days*. \n\nPrinted from offset plates photographically reproduced from 440a. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nWhitman, *Poems* (1921–1928) 94.1a \nWhitman, *Leaves of Grass* (1929–1950) 94.1e; *as 94.1a except for title change* \nWhitman, *Leaves of Grass* (Giant, 1940– ) G48 \nWhitman, *Leaves of Grass*, illus.
