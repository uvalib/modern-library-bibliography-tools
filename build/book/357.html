<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Few books in the annals of American literature have exercised so far-reaching an influence in awakening interest in the social order as has Edward Bellamy’s utopian novel, <em>Looking Backward</em>. In its own field it is a classic in the tradition of Plato’s <em>Republic</em>, Thomas More’s <em>Utopia</em> and William Morris’s <em>News from Nowhere</em>. Today, while a new world is in the making and everyone is venturing guesses as to its reorganization, this novel is a visionary’s guide to our own future. Its inclusion in the Modern Library series gives new emphasis to the perennial timeliness of Bellamy’s masterpiece. (<em>Spring 1942</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Ticknor &amp; Co., 1888. New edition with revisions in the text and the addition of the author’s postscript published by Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1889, to which the Broun introduction was later added. New bibliographical edition without the Broun introduction published by Houghton, Mifflin, 1941. ML edition (pp. [v]–vi, [1]–276) printed from plates previously used for the 1941 Houghton, Mifflin edition with Broun introduction restored. Publication announced for November 1942. <em>WR</em> 31 October 1942. First printing: Not established. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>The ML edition was published shortly before <em>Looking Backward</em> entered the public domain. By reprinting <em>Looking Backward</em> with the permission of Houghton Mifflin and paying royalties of 10 cents a copy, the ML was able to establish its edition in the marketplace before other potential reprinters.</p>
<p><em>Looking Backward</em> sold 10,019 copies by 1 November 1943, placing it high in the first quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Signed: E McKK [E. McKnight Kauffer].\n\n> Front flap:<br> Few books in the annals of American literature have exercised so far-reaching an influence in awakening interest in the social order as has Edward Bellamy’s utopian novel, *Looking Backward*. In its own field it is a classic in the tradition of Plato’s *Republic*, Thomas More’s *Utopia* and William Morris’s *News from Nowhere*. Today, while a new world is in the making and everyone is venturing guesses as to its reorganization, this novel is a visionary’s guide to our own future. Its inclusion in the Modern Library series gives new emphasis to the perennial timeliness of Bellamy’s masterpiece. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by Ticknor & Co., 1888. New edition with revisions in the text and the addition of the author’s postscript published by Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1889, to which the Broun introduction was later added. New bibliographical edition without the Broun introduction published by Houghton, Mifflin, 1941. ML edition (pp. [v]–vi, [1]–276) printed from plates previously used for the 1941 Houghton, Mifflin edition with Broun introduction restored. Publication announced for November 1942. *WR* 31 October 1942. First printing: Not established. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML edition was published shortly before *Looking Backward* entered the public domain. By reprinting *Looking Backward* with the permission of Houghton Mifflin and paying royalties of 10 cents a copy, the ML was able to establish its edition in the marketplace before other potential reprinters.\n\n*Looking Backward* sold 10,019 copies by 1 November 1943, placing it high in the first quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n#### 357b.

Signed: E McKK [E. McKnight Kauffer].\n\n> Front flap:<br> Few books in the annals of American literature have exercised so far-reaching an influence in awakening interest in the social order as has Edward Bellamy’s utopian novel, *Looking Backward*. In its own field it is a classic in the tradition of Plato’s *Republic*, Thomas More’s *Utopia* and William Morris’s *News from Nowhere*. Today, while a new world is in the making and everyone is venturing guesses as to its reorganization, this novel is a visionary’s guide to our own future. Its inclusion in the Modern Library series gives new emphasis to the perennial timeliness of Bellamy’s masterpiece. (*Spring 1942*)\n\nOriginally published by Ticknor & Co., 1888. New edition with revisions in the text and the addition of the author’s postscript published by Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1889, to which the Broun introduction was later added. New bibliographical edition without the Broun introduction published by Houghton, Mifflin, 1941. ML edition (pp. [v]–vi, [1]–276) printed from plates previously used for the 1941 Houghton, Mifflin edition with Broun introduction restored. Publication announced for November 1942. *WR* 31 October 1942. First printing: Not established. Discontinued 1971/72.\n\nThe ML edition was published shortly before *Looking Backward* entered the public domain. By reprinting *Looking Backward* with the permission of Houghton Mifflin and paying royalties of 10 cents a copy, the ML was able to establish its edition in the marketplace before other potential reprinters.\n\n*Looking Backward* sold 10,019 copies by 1 November 1943, placing it high in the first quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.\n\n"
