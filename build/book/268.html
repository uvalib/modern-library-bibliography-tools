(<em>Spring 1934</em>) <em>Note:</em> The fourth leaf of the first gathering (pp. vii–viii) has been cancelled and replaced by a newly printed leaf; the first gathering is normal in later printings. It is not known whether the original leaf was cancelled because of a printer’s error or a last-minute revision by Caldwell.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in vivid orange (48), moderate green (145) and dark grayish brown (62) on cream paper depicting vivid orange sun rising over moderate green fields; borders in vivid orange, title in reverse on three moderate green banners, other lettering in dark grayish brown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> When the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, through its agent, John S. Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of <em>God’s Little Acre</em> on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case, declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.” The Modern Library now adds <em>God’s Little Acre</em> to its list as a serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp. [v], [1]–[311]) printed from Viking plates, which were subsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown &amp; Co. Published April 1934. <em>WR</em> 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Caldwell received $50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf to Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them. I hope so. (p. ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition was realized most fully after the introduction of mass market paperbacks. The paperback edition of <em>God’s Little Acre</em>, published in 1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by Penguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its first nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern paperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million copies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).</p>
<p>The biographical note and bibliography on p. [vi] were updated at Caldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27 December 1938). The plates and publishing rights to <em>God’s Little Acre</em> were transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall 1939 and passed to Little, Brown &amp; Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged its printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one printing under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.</p>
<p>The ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted that the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934 and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12 cents a copy.</p>
<p>The ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total sales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to James Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).</p>

<p><em>Jacket A:</em> As 268.1b except front flap rewritten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Erskine Caldwell’s story of a Georgia dirt farmer, Ty Ty Walden, and of Ty Ty’s sons and intensely attractive daughters has achieved a popularity that has been phenomenal and undiminishing. With almost seven million copies in print, <em>God’s Little Acre</em> has attained the status of an all-time permanent best-seller. Its comedy of the man who dedicated an acre of land to God—a barren, useless acre—has become virtually a part of our national folklore, and the novel is now generally recognized as a classic. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Fujita pictorial jacket in strong brown (55), deep orange yellow (69) and black on coated white paper with inset strong brown panel at top with title in reverse, tree in black at upper right of panel, and tree in deep orange yellow and house in reverse at lower left; author in strong brown and series in black below upper panel, all against white background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised and abridged from jacket A:  <br> Erskine Caldwell’s story of a Georgia dirt farmer, Ty Ty Walden, and of Ty Ty’s sons and intensely attractive daughters was one of the most successful novels of its time. Its comedy of the man who dedicated an acre of land to God—a barren, useless acre—has become virtually a part of our national folklore, and the novel is now generally recognized as a classic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Printed from Little, Brown plates made from a new typesetting, 1957. The dedication, biographical note and bibliography, foreword, and appendix were omitted from the new typesetting at Caldwell’s request (Eleanor Pitt, Little, Brown, to Ruth Fenichel, 5 March 1957). The new plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML and Grosset &amp; Dunlap.</p>

(*Spring 1934*) *Note:* The fourth leaf of the first gathering (pp. vii–viii) has been cancelled and replaced by a newly printed leaf; the first gathering is normal in later printings. It is not known whether the original leaf was cancelled because of a printer’s error or a last-minute revision by Caldwell.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in vivid orange (48), moderate green (145) and dark grayish brown (62) on cream paper depicting vivid orange sun rising over moderate green fields; borders in vivid orange, title in reverse on three moderate green banners, other lettering in dark grayish brown.  \n\n> Front flap:<br> When the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, through its agent, John S. Sumner, brought an action for the suppression of *God’s Little Acre* on an obscenity charge, writers, critics and men and women in public life rallied to its support. Magistrate Benjamin Greenspan, in a memorable opinion, summarily dismissed the case, declaring that the book “was very clearly not a work of pornography.” The Modern Library now adds *God’s Little Acre* to its list as a serious novel of conspicuous literary merit. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\nOriginally published by Viking Press, 1933. ML edition (268.1, pp. [v], [1]–[311]) printed from Viking plates, which were subsequently owned by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and by Little, Brown & Co. Published April 1934. *WR* 28 April 1934. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nCaldwell received \\$50 for writing the foreword to the ML edition (Cerf to Caldwell, 12 October 1933). The foreword concludes:  \n\n> Some day I hope those for and of whom this story was written will have the opportunity to read it. So far it seems that its readers have mainly been those seeking sensation and pornography. I would willingly trade ten thousand of those for a hundred readers among the boys and girls with whom I walked barefoot to school in snow-crusted Tennessee winters and with whom I sweated through the summer nights in the mills of Georgia. Maybe this Modern Library edition will reach some of them. I hope so. (p. ix)  \n\nThe hope Caldwell expressed in 1933 in his foreword to the ML edition was realized most fully after the introduction of mass market paperbacks. The paperback edition of *God’s Little Acre*, published in 1946 by the American branch of Penguin Books (and subsequently by Penguin Signet and Signet Books) “sold about two million copies in its first nine months”; sales eventually ranked “among the highest of modern paperback publishing” (Bonn, p. 122, 197). There were almost 60 million copies of Caldwell’s books in Signet editions by 1960 (ibid., p. 197).  \n\nThe biographical note and bibliography on p. [vi] were updated at Caldwell’s request in the January 1939 printing (Cerf to Caldwell, 27 December 1938). The plates and publishing rights to *God’s Little Acre* were transferred from Viking Press to Duell, Sloan and Pearce in fall 1939 and passed to Little, Brown & Co. by the mid-1950s. The ML arranged its printings with each firm in succession. Little, Brown made one printing under its own imprint from the 268.1 plates.  \n\nThe ML paid royalties of 10 cents a copy. In 1957 Little, Brown noted that the retail price of ML books had increased several times since 1934 and inquired whether the royalty should be adjusted (Arthur Thornhill, Little, Brown, 17 September 1957). Later that year the ML began paying royalties of 12 cents a copy.  \n\nThe ML edition sold 6,393 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. Total sales of ML printings through spring 1957 were 75,403 copies (Klopfer to James Oliver Brown, James Brown Associates, 24 May 1957).  \n\n#### 268.1b.

(*Fall 1966 list but Spring 1967 format with 1960s binding C, tan Kent endpaper and jacket B*)  \n\n*Jacket A:* As 268.1b except front flap rewritten:  \n\n> Erskine Caldwell’s story of a Georgia dirt farmer, Ty Ty Walden, and of Ty Ty’s sons and intensely attractive daughters has achieved a popularity that has been phenomenal and undiminishing. With almost seven million copies in print, *God’s Little Acre* has attained the status of an all-time permanent best-seller. Its comedy of the man who dedicated an acre of land to God—a barren, useless acre—has become virtually a part of our national folklore, and the novel is now generally recognized as a classic. (*Fall 1958*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Fujita pictorial jacket in strong brown (55), deep orange yellow (69) and black on coated white paper with inset strong brown panel at top with title in reverse, tree in black at upper right of panel, and tree in deep orange yellow and house in reverse at lower left; author in strong brown and series in black below upper panel, all against white background.  \n\n>Front flap revised and abridged from jacket A:  <br> Erskine Caldwell’s story of a Georgia dirt farmer, Ty Ty Walden, and of Ty Ty’s sons and intensely attractive daughters was one of the most successful novels of its time. Its comedy of the man who dedicated an acre of land to God—a barren, useless acre—has become virtually a part of our national folklore, and the novel is now generally recognized as a classic.  \n\nPrinted from Little, Brown plates made from a new typesetting, 1957. The dedication, biographical note and bibliography, foreword, and appendix were omitted from the new typesetting at Caldwell’s request (Eleanor Pitt, Little, Brown, to Ruth Fenichel, 5 March 1957). The new plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML and Grosset & Dunlap.  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>  \nCaldwell, *Tobacco Road* (1947–1969) 397  \n\n",
