<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The glory that was Greece is ours for the reading. Here is the rich heritage from the golden age of the drama. The tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes are timeless. Today, as it was twenty-five centuries ago, the insight of these dramatists into the spirit of man and his relationship to nature, to society and to his own soul is deeply rewarding and stirring. The seven plays in this volume are unmatched in all the literature of the drama for intensity and magnitude and boisterous humor. (<em>Spring 1951</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology superseding <em>Four Famous Greek Plays</em>, ed. Paul Landis (1929: 178). Contents drawn from <em>The Complete Greek Drama</em>, ed. Oates and O’Neill in the Lifetime Library (2 vols., Random House, 1938). Published spring 1951. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted that <em>Four Famous Greek Plays</em> (178) would have to be completely revised. He told Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the Modern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart Edition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In addition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more specifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we prepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based upon the Lifetime Library [Random House] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK DRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give the College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted that <em>Seven Famous Greek Plays</em> would differ from the Rinehart anthology in the following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have Euripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally desirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I think for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do not.”</p>
<p>Stein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library edition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he indicated that the use of these translations would depend on the permission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit the ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions that prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the general introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein concluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book available for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of July 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1 February 1950).</p>
<p>Oates received a flat fee of $200 for his general introduction to Greek tragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a flat fee of $100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the introduction to <em>The Frogs</em>. Permission fees included $100 each for Aldington’s translation of <em>Alcestis</em> and Murray’s translation of <em>The Frogs</em>; More’s translation of <em>Prometheus Bound</em> appears to have required a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional $100 when <em>Seven Famous Greek Plays</em> was added to the regular ML (Commins to Oates, 28 June 1951).</p>

Here is the rich heritage from the golden age of the drama. The tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes are timeless. Today, as it was twenty-five centuries ago, the insight of these dramatists into the spirit of man and his relationship to nature, to society and to his own soul is deeply rewarding and stirring. The seven plays in this volume are unmatched in all the literature of the drama for intensity and magnitude and boisterous humor. (*Spring 1951*) \n\n*Jacket B1:* Non-pictorial in dark blue (183), vivid red (11) and black on coated white paper with collective title in reverse against white panel at top lined in black and larger dark blue panel below the foot with titles of individual plays in reverse against vivid red bars, torchbearer and series in vivid red, other lettering in reverse against dark blue background except. Signed: RIKI. Front flap as jacket A. (*Fall 1955*) \n\nOriginal ML anthology superseding *Four Famous Greek Plays*, ed. Paul Landis (1929: 178). Contents drawn from *The Complete Greek Drama*, ed. Oates and O’Neill in the Lifetime Library (2 vols., Random House, 1938). Published spring 1951. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nOriginally published 1950 in MLCE and the following year in the regular ML. When the new series MLCE was in the planning stages Stein noted that *Four Famous Greek Plays* (178) would have to be completely revised. He told Commins: “It is, as you know, one of the best-selling titles in the Modern Library, but it is very strongly threatened by the Rinehart Edition AN ANTHOLOGY OF GREEK DRAMA, which contains 6 plays. . . . In addition the introductory material in the Rinehart Edition is more specifically focused at the classroom use of the book. I suggest that we prepare a new edition to be known as SEVEN FAMOUS GREEK PLAYS, based upon the Lifetime Library [Random House] edition of THE COMPLETE GREEK DRAMA. . . .” The plays in the revised anthology were selected to give the College Edition a clear competitive advantage. Stein noted that *Seven Famous Greek Plays* would differ from the Rinehart anthology in the following respects: “They have Euripides’ Hippolytus; we have Euripedes’ Alcestis. Both are highly regarded and are I think equally desirable. We have Aristophanes’ The Frogs; they have Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. We avoid the problem of obscenity in Lysistrata wisely I think for classroom use. We have Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound; they do not.” \n\nStein proposed that the ML use the translations in the Lifetime Library edition. Two of the translations would require permission fees, and he indicated that the use of these translations would depend on the permission fees requested. He hoped that Oates and O’Neill would edit the ML edition. He wanted to retain their short editorial discussions that prefaced each play in the Lifetime Library, and he wanted the general introduction reduced from 40 pages to about 5,000 words. Stein concluded, “I think it is very important that we have this book available for classroom use in the fall. That means an outside date of July 15 for their introduction and notes” (Stein memo to Commins, 1 February 1950). \n\nOates received a flat fee of \\$200 for his general introduction to Greek tragedy and the introductions to six of the plays; O’Neill received a flat fee of \\$100 for his general introduction to Greek comedy and the introduction to *The Frogs*. Permission fees included \\$100 each for Aldington’s translation of *Alcestis* and Murray’s translation of *The Frogs*; More’s translation of *Prometheus Bound* appears to have required a permissions fee as well. Oates received an additional \\$100 when *Seven Famous Greek Plays* was added to the regular ML (Commins to Oates, 28 June 1951). \n\n#### 439b.
