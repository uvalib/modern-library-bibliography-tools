<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> As more and more we look westward across the Pacific, the writings of James A. Michener take on increased interest and importance as informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux.
The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer, his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia in rebirth.
In this volume are selections from <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>, <em>Return to Paradise</em>, <em>The Voice of Asia</em>, and the complete text of <em>The Bridges at Toko-Ri</em>. (<em>Spring 1957</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection selected from <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em> (Macmillan, 1947), <em>Return to Paradise</em> (RH, 1951), and <em>The Voice of Asia</em> (RH, 1951), with the complete text of <em>The Bridges of Toko-ri</em> (RH, 1953). Published April 1957. <em>WR</em> 29 April 1957. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986.</p>
<p>In the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition of his first book, <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>, “shows how little the publisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One important change has been made in the text here offered, and another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word <em>Asiatic</em> when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word to <em>Asian</em>. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps even greater fervor the word <em>Chinaman</em>. After my first several books appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I have corrected this offensive word to <em>Chinese</em>; but in certain stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>. He signed with Random House on 19 April 1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August 2010). His second book, <em>The Fires of Spring</em>, was published by Random House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a 1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old Mansion,” <em>PW</em>, 13 July 1946, p. 174).</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in the capitalization of <em>The Bridges at Toko-ri</em> are reproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a jacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of Toko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> James Michener has been one of America’s most popular writers since the publication of his first book, <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 and was later adapted into the fabulous musical <em>South Pacific</em> by Rodgers, Logan and Hammerstein. After this auspicious debut Michener went on to write a string of best sellers, including <em>Return to Paradise</em> (1951), <em>The Voice of Asia</em> (1951), <em>The Bridges at Toko-ri</em> (1953), <em>The Bridge at Andau</em> (1957), <em>Hawaii</em> (1959), <em>The Source</em> (1965), <em>Centennial</em> (1974), and <em>Chesapeake</em> (1978).
In this volume are selections from <em>Tales of the South Pacific</em>, <em>Return to Paradise</em>, <em>The Voice of Asia</em>, and the complete text of <em>The Bridges at Toko-ri</em>.</p>

(*Spring 1957*) \n\n*Contents:* <span class=\"smallcaps\">from Tales of the South Pacific</span>. Our Heroine – A Boar’s Tooth. <span class=\"smallcaps\">from Return to Paradise</span>. Mr. Morgan – Povenaaa’s Daughter – The Mynah Birds – The Fossickers. <span class=\"smallcaps\">from The Voice of Asia</span>.

Michener take on increased interest and importance as informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux. \n> The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer, his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia in rebirth. \n> In this volume are selections from *Tales of the South Pacific*, *Return to Paradise*, *The Voice of Asia*, and the complete text of *The Bridges at Toko-Ri*. (*Spring 1957*) \n\nOriginal ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific* (Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of Asia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri* (RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986. \n\nIn the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition of his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the publisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states: \n\n> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi). \n\nMichener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of *Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April 1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August 2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a 1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old Mansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174). \n\nInconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are reproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a jacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of Toko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.” \n\n#### 494b.
