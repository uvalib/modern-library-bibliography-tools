<p>Format: To accommodate the original plates, the trim size of <em>The Rainbow</em> increased to 6¾ x 4¼ in. (170 x 108 mm). After the balloon cloth binding was introduced in 1929 the trim size was widened to 6¾ x 4½ in. (170 x 113 mm).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> Ironically enough, it was the vain effort of a self-appointed censor to suppress “The Rainbow” that first called to the attention of the general public the enduring qualities of the book. It is one of those novels which England has produced that resembles its own immemorial oaks, with roots striking deep into the rich soil – the story of the Brangwens, whose menfolk, sturdy, lusty yeomen, might have had a place beside the knights and squires among the Canterbury Pilgrims. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The fierce ecstasy and sensual violence that pervade the novels of D. H. Lawrence reach their highest and most lyrical note in <em>The Rainbow</em>. The sturdy generations of Nottingham Brangwens of whom Lawrence writes are men and women of his own blood, possessed as he was by the hot, fecund urgency of the flesh, and made aware of all the dark and mystical labyrinths of physical love. <em>The Rainbow</em> ranks with the most distinguished works of fiction in our language dealing with sex, exalted and unashamed. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1915; reprinted from Huebsch plates by Thomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by Albert &amp; Charles Boni, 1926, and subsequently by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [v]–467) printed from Huebsch/Seltzer/Boni/Viking plates. Publication announced for March 1927. <em>WR</em> 18 June 1927. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; reissued 1980–90.</p>
<p>The ML arranged its printings with A. &amp; C. Boni through March 1931 and Viking Press from December 1932. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in December 1927 and five additional printings between November 1928 and March 1931 totaling 12,000 copies. Incomplete records of printings from the following decade suggest that sales declined to about 1,000 copies a year after 1932 and increased in the early 1940s to about 2,000 copies a year.</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> <em>The Rainbow</em> is D. H. Lawrence’s longest and most ambitious novel. He worked on it for three years, writing eight complete versions before he was satisfied. The story of three generations of a Nottingham family whose love affairs move backward and forward across the years, it is the first part of a trilogy that also includes <em>Women in Love</em> and <em>Aaron’s Rod</em>. Almost immediately upon its publication in 1915, it was prosecuted and banned as pornographic.</p>

(*Spring 1927*) \n\nFormat: To accommodate the original plates, the trim size of *The Rainbow* increased to 6¾ x 4¼ in. (170 x 108 mm). After the balloon cloth binding was introduced in 1929 the trim size was widened to 6¾ x 4½ in. (170 x 113 mm). \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B. \n\n> Text on front:<br> Ironically enough, it was the vain effort of a self-appointed censor to suppress “The Rainbow” that first called to the attention of the general public the enduring qualities of the book. It is one of those novels which England has produced that resembles its own immemorial oaks, with roots striking deep into the rich soil – the story of the Brangwens, whose menfolk, sturdy, lusty yeomen, might have had a place beside the knights and squires among the Canterbury Pilgrims. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Spring 1929*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> The fierce ecstasy and sensual violence that pervade the novels of D. H. Lawrence reach their highest and most lyrical note in *The Rainbow*. The sturdy generations of Nottingham Brangwens of whom Lawrence writes are men and women of his own blood, possessed as he was by the hot, fecund urgency of the flesh, and made aware of all the dark and mystical labyrinths of physical love. *The Rainbow* ranks with the most distinguished works of fiction in our language dealing with sex, exalted and unashamed. (*Spring 1934*) \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1915; reprinted from Huebsch plates by Thomas Seltzer, 1924; plates acquired by Albert & Charles Boni, 1926, and subsequently by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [v]–467) printed from Huebsch/Seltzer/Boni/Viking plates. Publication announced for March 1927. *WR* 18 June 1927. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72; reissued 1980–90. \n\nThe ML arranged its printings with A. & C. Boni through March 1931 and Viking Press from December 1932. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in December 1927 and five additional printings between November 1928 and March 1931 totaling 12,000 copies. Incomplete records of printings from the following decade suggest that sales declined to about 1,000 copies a year after 1932 and increased in the early 1940s to about 2,000 copies a year. \n\n#### 138b.
