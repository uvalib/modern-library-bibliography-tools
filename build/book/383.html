(<em>Fall 1945</em>)</p>

Backstrip with “DE MAUPASSANT” in medium blue within inset rectangular panel framed in medium blue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The world owes to that unchallenged master of the short story, Guy de Maupassant, an immense and increasing debt for having given it an [±a new] insight into life as true as it is powerful and exciting [±stirring]. The forty-five tales in the 550 pages of this volume represent the flower of his work, [+work in the field of the short story, each] chosen with the purpose of giving variety, balance and sustained interest [+to the whole]. These stories [±tales] are as vital and as applicable [±meaningful] today as they were when they were first written during the feverish ten years of Maupassant’s creative life [+, from 1883 to 1893]. (<em>Fall 1946; [Spring 1956]</em>). <em>Note:</em> Fall 1945 jacket not seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A in vivid red (11) and dark blue (183) on coated white paper with lettering in reverse on vivid red panel at top, other lettering in reverse on smaller dark blue panel at foot, with a rule in reverse separating the panels. Front flap with spring 1956 text. (<em>Fall 1963</em>) <em>Note:</em> The elimination of a third color meant that the jacket was cheaper to print, but the inset backstrip panel with “DE MAUPASSANT” is unframed, making the backstrip less distinctive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The flaps and back panel of the jacket are also printed in vivid red and dark blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection superseding <em>The Best Stories of Guy de Maupassant</em>, translated by Michael Monahan (1932). Published fall 1945. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p><em>The Best Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant</em> was originally entrusted to Aaron Sussman, a partner in the firm that handled Random House’s advertising, and Whit Burnet, the editor of <em>Story</em> magazine. They were unable to complete the volume, perhaps because Sussman’s advertising agency was reorganized in 1944 from Franklin Spier &amp; Aaron Sussman to Sussman &amp; Sugar. Commins took over the editing of the volume and received a flat fee of $300 for his efforts—the same amount that had been offered to Sussman and Burnet (Cerf to Commins, 26 January 1945; Saxe Commins Papers, Princeton University Library).</p>
<p>Commins used the anonymous translations in <em>The Life and Work of Henri Rene Guy de Maupassant</em> (17 vols., M. W. Dunne, 1903) because they were in the public domain. The alternative was to use translations by several hands with many copyright complications (Commins to Alfred A. Knopf, 21 February 1950).</p>
<p>Commins’s edition of <em>The Best Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant</em> was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.</p>

Backstrip with “DE MAUPASSANT” in medium blue within inset rectangular panel framed in medium blue. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The world owes to that unchallenged master of the short story, Guy de Maupassant, an immense and increasing debt for having given it an [±a new] insight into life as true as it is powerful and exciting [±stirring]. The forty-five tales in the 550 pages of this volume represent the flower of his work, [+work in the field of the short story, each] chosen with the purpose of giving variety, balance and sustained interest [+to the whole]. These stories [±tales] are as vital and as applicable [±meaningful] today as they were when they were first written during the feverish ten years of Maupassant’s creative life [+, from 1883 to 1893]. (*Fall 1946; [Spring 1956]*). *Note:* Fall 1945 jacket not seen. \n\n*Jacket B:* As jacket A in vivid red (11) and dark blue (183) on coated white paper with lettering in reverse on vivid red panel at top, other lettering in reverse on smaller dark blue panel at foot, with a rule in reverse separating the panels. Front flap with spring 1956 text. (*Fall 1963*) *Note:* The elimination of a third color meant that the jacket was cheaper to print, but the inset backstrip panel with “DE MAUPASSANT” is unframed, making the backstrip less distinctive. \n\n> The flaps and back panel of the jacket are also printed in vivid red and dark blue. \n\nOriginal ML collection superseding *The Best Stories of Guy de Maupassant*, translated by Michael Monahan (1932). Published fall 1945. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. \n\n*The Best Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* was originally entrusted to Aaron Sussman, a partner in the firm that handled Random House’s advertising, and Whit Burnet, the editor of *Story* magazine. They were unable to complete the volume, perhaps because Sussman’s advertising agency was reorganized in 1944 from Franklin Spier & Aaron Sussman to Sussman & Sugar. Commins took over the editing of the volume and received a flat fee of \\$300 for his efforts—the same amount that had been offered to Sussman and Burnet (Cerf to Commins, 26 January 1945; Saxe Commins Papers, Princeton University Library). \n\nCommins used the anonymous translations in *The Life and Work of Henri Rene Guy de Maupassant* (17 vols., M. W. Dunne, 1903) because they were in the public domain. The alternative was to use translations by several hands with many copyright complications (Commins to Alfred A. Knopf, 21 February 1950). \n\nCommins’s edition of *The Best Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant* was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nMaupassant, Guy de, *Best Stories*, trans.
