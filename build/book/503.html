<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s finest writers of short stories and plays when <em>The Young Lions</em> appeared. The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented, and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of mind.”
Time has proved their judgments right, for this engrossing novel of men at war is in fact a testament of our century. It is the story of modern man in a moment of extreme ordeal, dramatically told by an acutely sensitive creative writer. The editors of the Modern Library are proud to include it as a work of distinguished and enduring achievement. (<em>Spring 1958</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> When <em>The Young Lions</em> was published in 1948, Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s foremost short story writers and playwrights. But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short stories,” wrote <em>The Saturday Review</em>. The story of three young men—a Nazi, a Jew, and an American—<em>The Young Lions</em> takes place bestween [<em>sic</em>] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wrote <em>The New York Herald Tribune</em>, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been reconfirmed many times.</p>

[1–22]<sup>16</sup> \n\n[*1*–*2*] blank; [*3*] half title; [*4*] epigraph from Nahum 2.13; [*5*] title; [*6*] First Modern Library Edition, 1958 | Copyright, 1948, by Irwin Shaw; [*7*] dedication; [*8*] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–689 text; [690–696] blank. \n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in brilliant yellow (83), deep reddish orange (36), brownish black (65) and black on coated white paper with colors emanating from white center like an explosion; title and author in black on white center; other lettering in deep reddish orange and brilliant yellow. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s finest writers of short stories and plays when *The Young Lions* appeared. The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented, and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of mind.” \n> Time has proved their judgments right, for this engrossing novel of men at war is in fact a testament of our century. It is the story of modern man in a moment of extreme ordeal, dramatically told by an acutely sensitive creative writer. The editors of the Modern Library are proud to include it as a work of distinguished and enduring achievement. (*Spring 1958*) \n\nOriginally published by Random House, 1948. ML edition (pp. [*4*], [*7*]–689) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the RH edition; title page adapted from the RH edition. Published May 1958. *WR* 19 May 1958. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72; reissued 1982–90. \n\nThere was a printing of 10,500 copies in 1959. Sales of the ML edition totaled 32,823 copies by fall 1966. \n\n#### 503b.

But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short stories,” wrote *The Saturday Review*. The story of three young men—a Nazi, a Jew, and an American—*The Young Lions* takes place bestween [*sic*] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wrote *The New York Herald Tribune*, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been reconfirmed many times. \n\nPublished spring 1982 at \\$7.95.
