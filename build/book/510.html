<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Of the great modern poets, no one is held in greater esteem than W. H. Auden. In the opinion of many, he is regarded as the foremost poet of our time.
It is with particular pride, therefore, that the publishers of the Modern Library make this book available to the large number of readers who have long wished for such a volume.
This book contains a generous selection of Auden’s poetry. Here the reader will find constant enjoyment in the spirited wit, the wide-ranging intellect, the emotional power, and the unsurpassed artistry that are among Auden’s characteristics. (<em>Spring 1959</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in Britain as <em>W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author</em> (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. <em>WR</em> 23 February 1959. First printing: 7,500 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for the ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of <em>The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden</em> which Random House published in 1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer turned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in Vintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback edition because <em>Collected Poetry</em> was selling so well (Klopfer to Alfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957).</p>
<p>The ML reprinted <em>W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author</em> because Auden did not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered buying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S. copyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been set in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention, which the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement for works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S. citizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer wrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might invalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set of proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of uncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the Penguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7 July 1958).</p>
<p>Auden included the following note on p. [<em>8</em>] following the table of contents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the chronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the last from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony or sense or both”.</p>
<p>The ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson report a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings of 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two printings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and 7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Second edition printed from offset plates with half title, lines 2–7 and 9 of title page, table of contents through p. [10] line 5, first three lines of fly title (shifted from two to three lines), pp. 3–172, and first 15 lines of p. 173 photographically reproduced from 510a; new poems added on pp. 173–232; indexes of poems and first lines revised and reset. Published in Vintage Books, November 1971; ML edition probably appeared a few months later. <em>WR</em> not found. First printing: Not ascertained.</p>
<p>Auden sent Epstein a list of poems to be added in the second edition. He later requested that the author’s note (510a, p. [<em>8</em>]) be deleted from the second edition (Pohoryles memo to Joan Milarsky, 29 April 1971). Epstein indicated that the second edition should be out in a Vintage paperback in September and the regular ML by early 1972 (Epstein to Auden, 28 January 1971). Auden received a $2,000 advance against royalties of 5 percent of the retail price for the ML edition and 7½ percent of the retail price for the Vintage Books edition (contract dated 16 February 1971).</p>

(*Spring 1959*) \n\n*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in brilliant yellow (83), light greenish blue (172) and black on coated white paper with lettering in black (except periods after initials in light greenish blue) on brilliant yellow, white and light greenish blue panels. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Of the great modern poets, no one is held in greater esteem than W. H. Auden. In the opinion of many, he is regarded as the foremost poet of our time. \n> It is with particular pride, therefore, that the publishers of the Modern Library make this book available to the large number of readers who have long wished for such a volume. \n> This book contains a generous selection of Auden’s poetry. Here the reader will find constant enjoyment in the spirited wit, the wide-ranging intellect, the emotional power, and the unsurpassed artistry that are among Auden’s characteristics. (*Spring 1959*) \n\nOriginally published in Britain as *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* (Penguin Books, 1958). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 16 February 1959. *WR* 23 February 1959. First printing: 7,500 copies. \n\nCerf first expressed interest in a volume of Auden’s selected poetry for the ML in 1956, indicating that he didn’t think it would hurt sales of *The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden* which Random House published in 1945 (Cerf to Auden, 23 February 1956). The following year Klopfer turned down a Knopf proposal to publish a collection of Auden’s poems in Vintage Books, explaining that RH had not published a ML or paperback edition because *Collected Poetry* was selling so well (Klopfer to Alfred Knopf, Jr., 30 January 1957). \n\nThe ML reprinted *W. H. Auden: A Selection by the Author* because Auden did not want to make a separate selection for the ML. Klopfer considered buying plates from Penguin Books but changed his mind. At the time U.S. copyright law limited eligibility for copyright to works that had been set in type and printed in the U.S. The Universal Copyright Convention, which the U.S. ratified in 1955, waived the manufacturing requirement for works by nationals of other contracting states but not for U.S. citizens. “I had forgotten that Auden is an American citizen,” Klopfer wrote, “and consequently the importation of such a set of plates might invalidate the copyright. He is too important to us to take a chance” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, Penguin Books, 9 April 1958). He asked for a set of proofs from which to set the ML edition. Lane sent a set of uncorrected galleys and Auden supplied a set of corrected proofs of the Penguin edition (Auden to Klopfer, 23 June 1958; Klopfer to Auden, 7 July 1958). \n\nAuden included the following note on p. [*8*] following the table of contents: “The poems in this volume are arranged more or less in the chronological order of their writing: the first dates from 1927, the last from 1954. Some of them I have revised in the interests of euphony or sense or both”. \n\nThe ML paid Auden royalties of 10 cents a copy. Bloomfield and Mendelson report a second printing of 5,000 copies (1959) and subsequent printings of 5,000 copies (1961), 5,000 copies (1962), 5,525 copies (1963), two printings of 5,000 and 6,000 copies (1965), two printings of 6,000 and 7,775 copies (1967), and 7,800 copies (1969). \n\n#### 510b.

[10] line 5, first three lines of fly title (shifted from two to three lines), pp. 3–172, and first 15 lines of p. 173 photographically reproduced from 510a; new poems added on pp. 173–232; indexes of poems and first lines revised and reset. Published in Vintage Books, November 1971; ML edition probably appeared a few months later. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. \n\nAuden sent Epstein a list of poems to be added in the second edition. He later requested that the author’s note (510a, p. [*8*]) be deleted from the second edition (Pohoryles memo to Joan Milarsky, 29 April 1971). Epstein indicated that the second edition should be out in a Vintage paperback in September and the regular ML by early 1972 (Epstein to Auden, 28 January 1971). Auden received a \\$2,000 advance against royalties of 5 percent of the retail price for the ML edition and 7½ percent of the retail price for the Vintage Books edition (contract dated 16 February 1971). \n\nPublished at \\$2.95.
