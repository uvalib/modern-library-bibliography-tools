<p><em>Jacket:</em> Non-pictorial in light bluish gray (190), moderate blue (182), and black on coated white paper with background patterned like currents of a stream, deepening from light bluish gray at top to moderate blue at the foot; author in black, other lettering and torchbearer in reverse. Designed by Paul Galdone, June 1938; unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have wanted to include one of Dorothy Canfield’s novels in the series. They were confronted with an embarrassment of riches. The problem was solved by asking Dorothy Canfield herself to select her favorite novel. She unhesitatingly named <em>The Deepening Stream</em>. Of all her many books of fiction it best represents her unique storytelling gift. Here she brings vividly to life the drama of a young girl who grew to womanhood through love and suffering. (<em>Fall 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1930. ML edition (pp. [1]–393) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published 11 November 1938. <em>WR</em> 12 November 1938. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harcourt, Brace an advance of $500. Haas invited Canfield to write a preface of 6–7 pages and offered the ML’s usual $50 fee (Haas to Dorothy Canfield Fisher, 20 August 1937), but she apparently declined. There were printings of 2,000 copies each in October 1940, June 1941, and December 1941, and a printing of 1,000 copies in May 1943.</p>
<p><em>The Deepening Stream</em> sold 2,865 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Front flap revised:<br> When the editors of the Modern Library decided to include one of Dorothy Canfield’s novels in the series, they were confronted with an embarrassment of riches. The problem of making a choice was solved for them when Dorothy Canfield herself selected the work that, in her opinion, deserved permanence. She unhesitatingly named <em>The Deepening Stream</em> as the one among all her books of fiction that best represents her unique story-telling gifts. In her favorite novel she brings vividly and memorably to life the drama of a young girl who achieved womanhood through love and suffering. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>

Designed by Paul Galdone, June 1938; unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have wanted to include one of Dorothy Canfield’s novels in the series. They were confronted with an embarrassment of riches. The problem was solved by asking Dorothy Canfield herself to select her favorite novel. She unhesitatingly named *The Deepening Stream*. Of all her many books of fiction it best represents her unique storytelling gift. Here she brings vividly to life the drama of a young girl who grew to womanhood through love and suffering. (*Fall 1938*)   \n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1930. ML edition (pp. [1]–393) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published 11 November 1938. *WR* 12 November 1938. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.   \n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace an advance of \\$500. Haas invited Canfield to write a preface of 6–7 pages and offered the ML’s usual \\$50 fee (Haas to Dorothy Canfield Fisher, 20 August 1937), but she apparently declined. There were printings of 2,000 copies each in October 1940, June 1941, and December 1941, and a printing of 1,000 copies in May 1943.   \n\n*The Deepening Stream* sold 2,865 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\n#### 315b.

Designed by Paul Galdone, June 1938; unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> For a long time the editors of the Modern Library have wanted to include one of Dorothy Canfield’s novels in the series. They were confronted with an embarrassment of riches. The problem was solved by asking Dorothy Canfield herself to select her favorite novel. She unhesitatingly named *The Deepening Stream*. Of all her many books of fiction it best represents her unique storytelling gift. Here she brings vividly to life the drama of a young girl who grew to womanhood through love and suffering. (*Fall 1938*)   \n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1930. ML edition (pp. [1]–393) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published 11 November 1938. *WR* 12 November 1938. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.   \n\nThe ML paid Harcourt, Brace an advance of \\$500. Haas invited Canfield to write a preface of 6–7 pages and offered the ML’s usual \\$50 fee (Haas to Dorothy Canfield Fisher, 20 August 1937), but she apparently declined. There were printings of 2,000 copies each in October 1940, June 1941, and December 1941, and a printing of 1,000 copies in May 1943.   \n\n*The Deepening Stream* sold 2,865 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.   \n\n"
