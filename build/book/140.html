<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> Lafcadio Hearn was one of the very few white men who ever entered with real sympathy into the viewpoint of the East. As much as it was possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly authoritative note.
“In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='publishers note' src='/mlb/images/typejackets/Type_Jacket_D.webp'>Uniform typographic jacket D</uvalib-modal-image-button>. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Roberts Brothers, 1887. New bibliographical edition published by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1906. Little, Brown edition paginated [i–vii] viii [ix–x] [11–13] 14–203 [204]. ML edition (pp. [<em>5–6</em>], [7]–203) printed from Little, Brown plates with page numeral “viii” removed from second page of Hearn’s preface. Published May 1927. <em>WR</em> 28 May 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939.</p>
<p>The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 7 cents a copy. Initial sales were good and a second printing of 3,000 copies was made in December 1927. The third and fourth printings for 1,000 copies each were completed in December 1930 and November 1931.</p>
<p><em>Some Chinese Ghosts</em> sold 1,119 copies during the six-month period January–June 1928, placing it ninety-ninth out of 147 ML titles.</p>
<p>There was a final printing of jacket B in spring 1939 after the ML edition was discontinued. Most of the spring 1939 jackets are stamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used on copies sold as remainders.</p>

Contents as 140 except: [*4*] *First* statement omitted; [175] part title: NOTES (*Balloon cloth binding with* *fall 1930 jacket)* \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B. \n\n> Text on front:<br> Lafcadio Hearn was one of the very few white men who ever entered with real sympathy into the viewpoint of the East. As much as it was possible for an alien to do, he lived the actual daily life of an Oriental. His writing about the East has, in consequence, a peculiarly authoritative note. \n> “In preparing this volume”, he writes, “I sought especially to incorporate in it some of the weird beauty of the Chinese legend. . . . The humble traveler enters wonderingly into the vast and mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy, and culls a few of the marvellous flowers there growing—a self-luminous hwa-wang, a black lily, a phosphoric rose or two—as souvenirs of his curious voyage”. (*Spring 1927*) \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. (*Fall 1930*) \n\n> Front flap:<br> Nowhere is Lafcadio Hearn’s love for the mystical and his intimacy with the weird and unseen so vividly realized as in this volume of Chinese tales of the supernatural. These legendary stories haunt the reader as much for their fragrant prose as for their subtle and pervasive power. The unreal takes on reality and the magical becomes plain by the wizardry of the Greek-Irish writer who found his spiritual home and last resting-place in the Orient. (*Spring 1934*) \n\nOriginally published by Roberts Brothers, 1887. New bibliographical edition published by Little, Brown & Co., 1906. Little, Brown edition paginated [i–vii] viii [ix–x] [11–13] 14–203 [204]. ML edition (pp. [*5–6*], [7]–203) printed from Little, Brown plates with page numeral “viii” removed from second page of Hearn’s preface. Published May 1927. *WR* 28 May 1927. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1939. \n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 7 cents a copy. Initial sales were good and a second printing of 3,000 copies was made in December 1927. The third and fourth printings for 1,000 copies each were completed in December 1930 and November 1931. \n\n*Some Chinese Ghosts* sold 1,119 copies during the six-month period January–June 1928, placing it ninety-ninth out of 147 ML titles. \n\nThere was a final printing of jacket B in spring 1939 after the ML edition was discontinued. Most of the spring 1939 jackets are stamped “DISCONTINUED TITLE” and were used on copies sold as remainders. \n\n",
