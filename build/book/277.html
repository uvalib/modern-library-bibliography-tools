<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> As a companion volume to Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> (No. 166) and <em>The Odyssey</em> (No. 167), <em>Virgil’s Works</em> takes a prominent place among the classics of antiquity on the Modern Library shelf. The prose translation by J. W. Mackail of <em>The Aeneid</em>, <em>Eclogues</em> and <em>Georgics,</em> complete in one volume, is acknowledgedly the most authentic, in letter and in spirit, of the extant renderings. Students will find this edition of immense aid in their studies and all lovers of classical literature will welcome it in its new, compact and inexpensive format. (<em>Fall 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mackail’s translations of <em>The Aeneid</em> and <em>The Eclogues &amp; The Georgics</em> were originally published in London in the 1880s and were in the U.S. public domain. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1934. <em>WR</em> 29 December 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.</p>
<p>Cerf asked the textbook publisher F. S. Crofts what he thought of a complete Virgil in the ML and asked him to recommend someone to write the introduction (Cerf to Crofts, 28 March 1934).</p>
<p><em>Virgil’s Works</em> sold 4,277 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p>Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Stein wrote to Durham about revising the introduction (Stein to Durham, 27 January 1950) but discovered he had died. He then approached McDermott, who received $150 for the new introduction (Stein to McDermott, 23 February 1950).</p>

The prose translation by J. W. Mackail of *The Aeneid*, *Eclogues* and *Georgics,* complete in one volume, is acknowledgedly the most authentic, in letter and in spirit, of the extant renderings. Students will find this edition of immense aid in their studies and all lovers of classical literature will welcome it in its new, compact and inexpensive format. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nMackail’s translations of *The Aeneid* and *The Eclogues & The Georgics* were originally published in London in the 1880s and were in the U.S. public domain. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1934. *WR* 29 December 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.  \n\nCerf asked the textbook publisher F. S. Crofts what he thought of a complete Virgil in the ML and asked him to recommend someone to write the introduction (Cerf to Crofts, 28 March 1934).  \n\n*Virgil’s Works* sold 4,277 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 277b.

The prose translation by J. W. Mackail of *The Aeneid*, *Eclogues* and *Georgics,* complete in one volume, is acknowledgedly the most authentic, in letter and in spirit, of the extant renderings. Students will find this edition of immense aid in their studies and all lovers of classical literature will welcome it in its new, compact and inexpensive format. (*Fall 1934*)  \n\nMackail’s translations of *The Aeneid* and *The Eclogues & The Georgics* were originally published in London in the 1880s and were in the U.S. public domain. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1934. *WR* 29 December 1934. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969/70.  \n\nCerf asked the textbook publisher F. S. Crofts what he thought of a complete Virgil in the ML and asked him to recommend someone to write the introduction (Cerf to Crofts, 28 March 1934).  \n\n*Virgil’s Works* sold 4,277 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n"
