<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Non-pictorial on coated white paper with three panels from top to foot in strong brown (55), black and grayish yellow green (122) with lettering in reverse, strong brown and black with ML number “4” on backstrip.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> This dictionary has been prepared with the general reader specifically in mind. It provides reliable, clear, and concise information on practically all the words he is likely to look up—information on spelling, hyphenation, pronunciation, meaning, inflected forms, and numerous other aspects of the English language.
<em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> is based on <em>The American College Dictionary</em>, widely acclaimed as the most distinguished dictionary of its kind ever published. New and up to date, The Modern Library Dictionary is an indispensable and authoritative ready-reference work.
Unlike most old-fashioned dictionaries, this book is easily used and easily understood. Durably bound, it will readily absorb the constant use which its compact and handy size invites. (<em>Spring 1959)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B</em>: As jacket A with ML number “1” on backstrip. (<em>Fall 1959</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML dictionary based on <em>The American College Dictionary</em>, published by Random House in 1947. Published February 1959. <em>WR</em> 23 February 1959. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Cerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as 1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a duplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William Targ, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May 1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the <em>American College Dictionary</em> in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By deleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the content to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the dictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the <em>American College Dictionary</em> by 50 percent would require making much sharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a Giant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with <em>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</em>, the Funk and Wagnalls <em>Desk Standard Dictionary</em>, and the <em>Winston Advanced Dictionary</em> (School Edition). He estimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and that editorial expenses would run about $8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott, 18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans to publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. <em>The</em> <em>Modern Library Dictionary</em> (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000 entries.</p>
<p><em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall 1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because new business machines acquired by Random House could not handle number-letter combinations. Copies of <em>The Modern Library Dictionary</em> that remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number “1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets.</p>
<p>The <em>First</em> statement on the verso of the title page appears to have been removed on all subsequent printings.</p>

  "full": "\n**JESS STEIN, ed. THE MODERN LIBRARY DICTIONARY. 1959–1970. (ML 4; ML 1)** \n\n#### 509. First printing (1959) \n\nTHE | MODERN | LIBRARY | DICTIONARY | JESS STEIN, *Editor* | Managing Editor of *The American College Dictionary,* | Editor of *The American Everyday Dictionary,* etc. | THE MODERN LIBRARY [torchbearer D4] NEW YORK \n\nPp. [*4*], [1] 2–636. [1]<sup>16</sup> [2–10]<sup>32</sup> [11]<sup>16</sup> \n\n[*1*] title; [*2*] *First Modern Library Edition, 1959* | © *Copyright, 1957, by Random House, Inc*. | *Based upon the American College Dictionary,* | © *Copyright, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951,* | *1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958,* | *by Random House, Inc.*; [*3*] pub. note; [*4*] PRONUNCIATION KEY; [1]–636 text. \n\n*Jacket A:* Non-pictorial on coated white paper with three panels from top to foot in strong brown (55), black and grayish yellow green (122) with lettering in reverse, strong brown and black with ML number “4” on backstrip. \n\n> Front flap:<br> This dictionary has been prepared with the general reader specifically in mind. It provides reliable, clear, and concise information on practically all the words he is likely to look up—information on spelling, hyphenation, pronunciation, meaning, inflected forms, and numerous other aspects of the English language. \n> *The Modern Library Dictionary* is based on *The American College Dictionary*, widely acclaimed as the most distinguished dictionary of its kind ever published. New and up to date, The Modern Library Dictionary is an indispensable and authoritative ready-reference work. \n> Unlike most old-fashioned dictionaries, this book is easily used and easily understood. Durably bound, it will readily absorb the constant use which its compact and handy size invites. (*Spring 1959)* \n\n*Jacket B*: As jacket A with ML number “1” on backstrip. (*Fall 1959*) \n\nOriginal ML dictionary based on *The American College Dictionary*, published by Random House in 1947. Published February 1959. *WR* 23 February 1959. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nCerf was interested in publishing a dictionary in the ML as early as 1943, when he asked World Publishing Co. if it would consider selling a duplicate set of plates of its Universal Dictionary (Cerf to William Targ, World Publishing Co., 30 March 1943; B. D. Zevin to Cerf, 4 May 1943). Stein began working on an abridgment of the *American College Dictionary* in 1948 with the intention of publishing it as a Giant. By deleting a number of entries and shortening others he reduced the content to 60 percent of its original length. At this point the dictionary consisted of about 79,000 entries. He noted that cutting the *American College Dictionary* by 50 percent would require making much sharper deletions and rewriting many definitions. He indicated that a Giant containing 70,000 to 80,000 entries could compete with *The Concise Oxford Dictionary*, the Funk and Wagnalls *Desk Standard Dictionary*, and the *Winston Advanced Dictionary* (School Edition). He estimated that it would take about eight months to prepare the copy and that editorial expenses would run about \\$8,000 (Stein memo to Linscott, 18 May 1948). Perhaps because of the costs and the time involved, plans to publish a dictionary in the Giants were abandoned. *The* *Modern Library Dictionary* (1959: 509) was a much shorter work with 46,000 entries. \n\n*The Modern Library Dictionary* was shifted from ML 4 to ML 1 in fall 1959 when the 6-volume Shakespeare (364c–366c) was renumbered from 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B to ML 2–7. The renumbering was necessary because new business machines acquired by Random House could not handle number-letter combinations. Copies of *The Modern Library Dictionary* that remained in the warehouse were given new jackets with the number “1” on the spine. The first printing is found in both jackets. \n\nThe *First* statement on the verso of the title page appears to have been removed on all subsequent printings. \n\n",
