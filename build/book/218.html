<p><strong>MICHAEL ARTZIBASHEV. SANINE. 1931–1935. (ML 189)</strong></p>
<h4>218. First printing (1931)</h4>
<p>[within double rules] SANINE | [rule] | BY | MICHAEL ARTZIBASHEV | [rule] | TRANSLATED BY | PERCY PINKERTON | [rule] | WITH A PREFACE BY | ERNEST BOYD | [rule] | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/A3.webp'>torchbearer A3</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | [rule] | BENNETT A. CERF : DONALD S. KLOPFER | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK</p>
<p>Pp. [i–iv] v–x, 1–380 [381–382]. [1–12]<sup>16</sup> [13]<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='publishers note' src='/mlb/images/notes/D13.webp'>pub. note D13</uvalib-modal-image-button>; [iii] title; [iv] <em>Copyright, 1926, by the Viking Press, Inc.</em> | [short double rule] | FIRST MODERN LIBRARY EDITION | 1931; v–x PREFACE signed p. x: <span class="smallcaps">Ernest Boyd</span>; 1–380 text; [381–382] blank.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1931</em>)</p>
<p>Pinkerton translation originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1914, using sheets of the British edition published by Martin Secker. New bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by Ernest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published July 1931. <em>WR</em> 15 August 1931. First (and only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.</p>
<p>The ML paid Viking an $800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. The ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large for its format.</p>
<p>Sales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other advance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six months of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to competition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger than the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in 1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches taller than the ML edition.</p>
<p>The ML reprinted <em>Sanine</em> on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press owned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast <em>Sanine</em> irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf suggested an allowance of $240 but emphasized that the decision was entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates (Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates, and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).</p>

(*Spring 1931*)  \n\nPinkerton translation originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1914, using sheets of the British edition published by Martin Secker. New bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by Ernest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published July 1931. *WR* 15 August 1931. First (and only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.  \n\nThe ML paid Viking an \\$800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. The ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large for its format.  \n\nSales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other advance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six months of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to competition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger than the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in 1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches taller than the ML edition.  \n\nThe ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press owned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine* irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf suggested an allowance of \\$240 but emphasized that the decision was entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates (Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates, and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).  \n\n#### ***Fall***  \n\n",

(*Spring 1931*)  \n\nPinkerton translation originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1914, using sheets of the British edition published by Martin Secker. New bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by Ernest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published July 1931. *WR* 15 August 1931. First (and only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.  \n\nThe ML paid Viking an \\$800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. The ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large for its format.  \n\nSales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other advance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six months of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to competition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger than the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in 1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches taller than the ML edition.  \n\nThe ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press owned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine* irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf suggested an allowance of \\$240 but emphasized that the decision was entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates (Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates, and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).  \n\n"
