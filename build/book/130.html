<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> “New Grub Street” is George Gissing’s book of the heart, a chronicle of characters that he knew through the intimacy of suffering shared and defeats experienced or understood. It is called back to life today because of the insistent determination of a new age to regard Gissing as a stylist second to none, a keen analyst of motives, and an  extraordinary literary figure whose inexplicable hardships stir the imagination of an age surfeited with material things. (<em>Spring 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The only complete and unabridged edition of this book that exists today”. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> For those who cherish the dream of writing and for those who read and ponder the whole mystery of the anguish and ecstasy of authorship, <em>New Grub Street</em> is a book of revelation. Not only does it expose the shifts and subterfuges of meagre talents to provide marketable stuff and the devotion and sacrifice of those who consecrate themselves to the severest of arts, but it lays bare Gissing’s own fierce struggle against vulgarity and the world’s indifference. In that sense, it is a true book of the heart. (<em>Spring 1938</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in London by Smith, Elder (3 vols., 1891); originally published in U.S. by C. A. Brewster, 1904, using sheets of the second British edition. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1926. <em>WR</em> 25 December 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1943; new ML edition published 1985.</p>
<p>Cerf initially asked H. G. Wells to write the introduction. He told Wells that <em>New Grub Street</em> was “long out of print in this country, and knowing your enthusiasm for the work, I am wondering whether you will add a short introduction for us.” He offered the ML’s usual $50 fee and reminded Wells that <em>Ann Veronica</em> continued to sell very well in the series (Cerf to Wells, 13 January 1926). Wells declined, but six years later he wrote an introduction to the fine press edition of <em>The Time Machine</em> published by Random House.</p>
<p>Sales of <em>New Grub Street</em> during the first six months of 1928 placed it 91st out of 147 ML titles.</p>
<p>Coustillas (pp. 565–69) provides a detailed inventory of variant bindings and other details of successive ML printings.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in strong reddish brown (40) and black on kraft paper with inset woodcut illustration by Stephen Alcorn of author at writing table; title in reverse on strong reddish brown panel, other lettering in black.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> <em>New Grub Street</em>, one of the first exponents of Naturalism in English literature, has been described as a cross between the works of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, and is much acclaimed for its portrait of the unsuccessful literary life in 19th century London. It is the story of Edward Reardon, a novelist whose valiant and painstaking attempts to maintain the standards of his art in the face of severe financial pressure are opposed by an unsympathetic wife. In sharp contrast to Reardon is his friend Jasper Milvain, an essayist who adjusts himself with shocking ease to currently materialistic ideals. A grimly realistic look at the hardships and compromises of the modern literary world, <em>New Grub Street</em> is an underground classic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bibliographical edition originally published 1962 by Houghton Mifflin Co. in its textbook series Riverside Editions, with an introduction and bibliographical note by Irving Howe. ML edition (pp. [1–2], [5]–425) printed either from Houghton Mifflin letterpress plates or from offset plates made from the Houghton Mifflin edition, with Howe’s introduction and bibliographical note omitted. The Houghton Mifflin edition placed its fly title before the table of contents; when the ML reversed the order it removed the page numeral “4” from the second page of the table of contents. Published April 1985 at $8.95. ISBN 0-394-60525-X.</p>

Contents as 130.1a except: [ii] pub. note A6; [iv] manufacturing statement; [553–558] ML list. (*Spring 1935*)  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n> Text on front:<br> “New Grub Street” is George Gissing’s book of the heart, a chronicle of characters that he knew through the intimacy of suffering shared and defeats experienced or understood. It is called back to life today because of the insistent determination of a new age to regard Gissing as a stylist second to none, a keen analyst of motives, and an  extraordinary literary figure whose inexplicable hardships stir the imagination of an age surfeited with material things. (*Spring 1927*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front: “The only complete and unabridged edition of this book that exists today”. (*Fall 1930*)  \n\n> Front flap: <br> For those who cherish the dream of writing and for those who read and ponder the whole mystery of the anguish and ecstasy of authorship, *New Grub Street* is a book of revelation. Not only does it expose the shifts and subterfuges of meagre talents to provide marketable stuff and the devotion and sacrifice of those who consecrate themselves to the severest of arts, but it lays bare Gissing’s own fierce struggle against vulgarity and the world’s indifference. In that sense, it is a true book of the heart. (*Spring 1938*)  \n\nOriginally published in London by Smith, Elder (3 vols., 1891); originally published in U.S. by C. A. Brewster, 1904, using sheets of the second British edition. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1926. *WR* 25 December 1926. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1943; new ML edition published 1985.  \n\nCerf initially asked H. G. Wells to write the introduction. He told Wells that *New Grub Street* was “long out of print in this country, and knowing your enthusiasm for the work, I am wondering whether you will add a short introduction for us.” He offered the ML’s usual \\$50 fee and reminded Wells that *Ann Veronica* continued to sell very well in the series (Cerf to Wells, 13 January 1926). Wells declined, but six years later he wrote an introduction to the fine press edition of *The Time Machine* published by Random House.  \n\nSales of *New Grub Street* during the first six months of 1928 placed it 91st out of 147 ML titles.  \n\nCoustillas (pp. 565–69) provides a detailed inventory of variant bindings and other details of successive ML printings.  \n\n#### 130.1b.

It is the story of Edward Reardon, a novelist whose valiant and painstaking attempts to maintain the standards of his art in the face of severe financial pressure are opposed by an unsympathetic wife. In sharp contrast to Reardon is his friend Jasper Milvain, an essayist who adjusts himself with shocking ease to currently materialistic ideals. A grimly realistic look at the hardships and compromises of the modern literary world, *New Grub Street* is an underground classic.  \n\nBibliographical edition originally published 1962 by Houghton Mifflin Co. in its textbook series Riverside Editions, with an introduction and bibliographical note by Irving Howe. ML edition (pp. [1–2], [5]–425) printed either from Houghton Mifflin letterpress plates or from offset plates made from the Houghton Mifflin edition, with Howe’s introduction and bibliographical note omitted. The Houghton Mifflin edition placed its fly title before the table of contents; when the ML reversed the order it removed the page numeral “4” from the second page of the table of contents. Published April 1985 at \\$8.95. ISBN 0-394-60525-X.  \n\nCoustillas indicates that the printing in the reissue format was remaindered in the year of publication (p. 569).  \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span>\nGissing, *Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft* (1918–1942) 45 ",
