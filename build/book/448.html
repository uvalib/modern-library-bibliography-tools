(<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>
<p><em>Contents:</em> Cato, by Joseph Addison – The Tragedy of Jane Shore, by Nicholas Rowe – The Conscious Lovers, by Richard Steele – The Beggar’s Opera, by John Gay – The Tragedy of Tragedies (Tom Thumb the Great), by Henry Fielding – The London Merchant, by George Lillo – She Stoops to Conquer, by Oliver Goldsmith – The Rivals, by Richard Brinsley Sheridan.</p>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Non-pictorial in dark green (146) and black on tan paper with spine and left quarter of front panel in dark green with collective title in reverse running from foot to top; remainder of front panel in tan with titles and authors of individual plays in black.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The modern theatre keeps a favorite place in its repertory for such eighteenth-century plays as Gay’s <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em>, Goldsmith’s <em>She Stoops to Conquer</em> and Sheridan’s <em>The Rivals</em>. Their gaiety, wit and charm make them as enjoyable to us as the latest Broadway hits. Equally appealing, though less frequently produced nowadays, are the other five plays in this volume. All of them make superb reading and offer great rewards from the treasury of eighteenth-century drama. Professor Ricardo Quintana, Chairman of the English Department at the University of Wisconsin, contributes an informative and penetrating Introduction. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> As jacket A on coated white paper. (<em>Fall 1958</em>)</p>
<p>Original ML anthology. Published spring 1952. <em>WR</em> 5 April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Quintana received a flat fee of $200 for writing the introduction and selecting the plays (Stein to Quintana, 27 June 1950). The volume was originally scheduled for MLCE but appeared first in the regular ML. Textual note on p. [iv]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the plays in this volume are based upon the first editions, except <em>The London Merchant</em> (sixth edition, 1735), <em>She Stoops to Conquer</em> (fifth edition, 1773), and <em>The Rivals</em> (third edition, 1776)—these exceptions being made because the later editions show changes reliably believed to have been made by the authors.
A few emendations have been introduced on the authority of other early editions. For the sake of clarity, a moderate number of changes in spelling and punctuation have been made; for the same reason, a small number of imperative stage directions have been inserted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> This volume of eighteenth-century plays includes three of the foremost comedies of the period—<em>The Beggar’s Opera</em> by Gay, <em>She Stoops to Conquer</em> by Goldsmith and <em>The Rivals</em> by Sheridan. Their biting wit and satire, combined with elements of farce, have made them enduring classics. Also included are five lesser-known plays of the period—two examples of early domestic tragedies: <em>Jane Shore</em> by Rowe and <em>The London Merchant</em> by Lillo; an early sentimental comedy: <em>The Conscious Lovers</em> by Steele; a pseudo-classical tragedy: <em>Cato</em> by Addison; and a burlesque heroic tragedy: <em>The Tragedy of Tragedies</em> by Fielding. All eight plays offer a comprehensive collection of eighteenth-century drama. Ricardo Quintana, of the University of Wisconsin English Department, contributes an informative and penetrating introduction.</p>

Also included are five lesser-known plays of the period—two examples of early domestic tragedies: *Jane Shore* by Rowe and *The London Merchant* by Lillo; an early sentimental comedy: *The Conscious Lovers* by Steele; a pseudo-classical tragedy: *Cato* by Addison; and a burlesque heroic tragedy: *The Tragedy of Tragedies* by Fielding.
