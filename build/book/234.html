<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Pictorial in grayish reddish orange (39) and black on cream paper depicting a woman carrying a sheaf of grain with building outlined in background; borders grayish reddish brown, lettering in black. Signed: [Amy] Hogeboom. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> has earned a prominent place on the shelf of the world’s greatest novels. Time does not lessen its appeal. The years since its publication have witnessed a constantly renewing enthusiasm for this heroic story of a woman victimized by an implacable fate. The fate of the novel itself is the highest tribute to its quality. In the beginning, <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> was shunned and anathematized as immoral; now it is acknowledgedly one of the outstanding literary achievements of the nineteenth century. (<em>Spring 1934</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Pictorial in light green (144), moderate green (145) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black and cream of a man and woman on a stone bridge over stream; background in light green with lettering in black and reverse, all within triple-rule frame in moderate green. Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1938; unsigned.</p>

<p>Originally published in U.S. by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1892. “New and Completely Revised Edition” published 1893. ML edition (pp. [vii]–457) printed from plates of the 1893 Harper edition with placement of CONTENTS and the epigraph from Shakespeare reversed. Published March 1932. <em>WR</em> 16 April 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1979–86.</p>
<p>The ML paid Harper’s a $2,000 advance. Royalties were paid on sales rather than printings, but the rate has not been ascertained.</p>
<p><em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> sold 7,699 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Hardy’s <em>Return of the Native</em> (126) outsold <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> by about 30 copies. <em>The Mayor of Casterbridge</em> (17) and <em>Jude the Obscure</em> (145) ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles. <em>The Return of the Native</em> remained the ML’s best-selling Hardy title during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, ranking low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> and the other two Hardy titles were not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series during that period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Implacable fate plays a major role in the novels of Thomas Hardy. In <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy. The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last decade of the nineteenth century. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bibliographical edition originally published by Harper &amp; Brothers, 1920. ML edition (pp. xxv–[xxxiv], [1] – [508]) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with running heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s Wessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format, 1979–86.</p>
<p>When plans were made to publish <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> in MLCE, Stein offered Weber $150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30 June 1950). Weber accepted but added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what, please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920 edition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport, Tennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty of 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML format, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer. The ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the Harper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950). The map was included at Weber’s suggestion.</p>

Signed: [Amy] Hogeboom. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* has earned a prominent place on the shelf of the world’s greatest novels. Time does not lessen its appeal. The years since its publication have witnessed a constantly renewing enthusiasm for this heroic story of a woman victimized by an implacable fate. The fate of the novel itself is the highest tribute to its quality. In the beginning, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* was shunned and anathematized as immoral; now it is acknowledgedly one of the outstanding literary achievements of the nineteenth century. (*Spring 1934*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Pictorial in light green (144), moderate green (145) and black on cream paper with inset wood engraving in black and cream of a man and woman on a stone bridge over stream; background in light green with lettering in black and reverse, all within triple-rule frame in moderate green. Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1938; unsigned. \n\n> Front flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1939*)  \n\nOriginally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1892. “New and Completely Revised Edition” published 1893. ML edition (pp. [vii]–457) printed from plates of the 1893 Harper edition with placement of CONTENTS and the epigraph from Shakespeare reversed. Published March 1932. *WR* 16 April 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1979–86.  \n\nThe ML paid Harper’s a \\$2,000 advance. Royalties were paid on sales rather than printings, but the rate has not been ascertained.  \n\n*Tess of the D’Urbervilles* sold 7,699 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Hardy’s *Return of the Native* (126) outsold *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* by about 30 copies. *The Mayor of Casterbridge* (17) and *Jude the Obscure* (145) ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles. *The Return of the Native* remained the ML’s best-selling Hardy title during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, ranking low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* and the other two Hardy titles were not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series during that period.  \n\n#### 234.1b.

In *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy. The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last decade of the nineteenth century. (*Fall 1956*)  \n\nBibliographical edition originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1920. ML edition (pp. xxv–[xxxiv], [1] – [508]) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with running heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s Wessex redrawn. Published 1951 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Discontinued from regular ML, 1971; published in “reissue” format, 1979–86.  \n\nWhen plans were made to publish *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* in MLCE, Stein offered Weber \\$150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30 June 1950). Weber accepted but added:  \n\n> I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what, please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).  \n\nStein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920 edition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport, Tennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty of 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML format, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer. The ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the Harper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950). The map was included at Weber’s suggestion.  \n\n#### 234.2b.
