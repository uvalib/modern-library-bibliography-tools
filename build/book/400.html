<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The 1930 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature is now represented in the Modern Library series by three novels. The first two (<em>Arrowsmith</em> No. 42 and <em>Babbitt</em> No. 162) have maintained, year after year, a commanding place among the most popular books on the list. Now <em>Dodsworth</em>, Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape from the tensions of industrialism and in revolt against European patronage of America, is given permanence among the best of the world’s best books. Clifton Fadiman contributes a sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his Foreword. (<em>Fall 1947</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br> Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape from the tensions of his own industrial empire and in revolt against the patronizing attitudes of Europeans toward Americans is one of his most enduring novels. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930 is nowhere so critical of his own countrymen and nowhere so proud of their genuine attainments. In this respect <em>Dodsworth</em> is a novel of protest and yet of irony; it represents Sinclair Lewis at his best as an observer and as a satirist. Clifton Fadiman contributes a perceptive and sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his Foreword. (<em>Spring 1962</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. 1–377) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1947. <em>WR</em> 10 January 1948. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>After following his editor, Harry Maule, from Doubleday to Random House, Lewis expressed the hope that <em>Dodsworth</em> could be added to the ML alongside <em>Arrowsmith</em> (254) and <em>Babbitt</em> (348). The ML tried to secure reprint rights in 1941, but negotiations with Harcourt, Brace were unsuccessful. Lewis then suggested <em>Elmer</em> <em>Gantry</em>, which apparently would have been available, but Cerf thought that any of his major works would be preferable (Lewis to Maule, 26 June 1941; Maule memo to Cerf, 27 June 1941; Maule to Lewis, 8 July 1941). Five years later Cerf approached Harcourt, Brace again, pointing out that Lewis was anxious to have <em>Dodsworth</em> in the series (Cerf to Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, 6 September 1946). This time he was successful, and the ML secured U.S. and Canadian reprint rights.</p>
<h4>400b. Title page with Fujita torchbearer; 7½ inch format (1969/70)</h4>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Fujita pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74) and black on coated white paper with inset photographic portrait of Lewis in strong yellowish brown and black; lettering below portrait with SINCLAIR LEWIS outlined in reverse, title in black capitals, and statement “With a Foreword by Clifton Fadiman” in black, all within single-rule frame in reverse against strong yellowish brown background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Lewis’ study of a Midwestern automobile magnate abroad ranks, with <em>Main Street</em>, <em>Babbitt</em>, and <em>Arrowsmith</em>, as a classic of American realism. These earlier novels exposed a narrow, provincial, materialist America—and cries of outrage did not prevent Lewis’ Zenith, his Babbitts and Gantrys, from becoming part of the American language and consciousness.
In <em>Dodsworth</em> he explores possibilities for regeneration and growth. Samuel Dodsworth, perhaps the most sympathetic character to emerge from Zenith, makes, with his wife, the time-honored pilgrimage to Europe—and what was intended as a vacation becomes a forced examination of a life too narrowly lived, of a marriage too fragile to sustain the pressures and temptations of a year’s leisure. Dodsworth’s honesty and his courage throughout his ordeal allow him to survive and to grow—and in this last of Lewis’ pre-Depression novels, satire is balanced by a cautious optimism.</p>

First printing (1947) \n\nDODSWORTH | A NOVEL BY | SINCLAIR LEWIS | WITH A FOREWORD BY | CLIFTON FADIMAN | [torchbearer D3] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | [rule] \n\nPp. [i–iv] v–vii [viii], 1–377 [378–384]. [1–10]<sup>16</sup> [11]<sup>20</sup> [12]<sup>16</sup> \n\n[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] COPYRIGHT, 1929, BY HARCOURT, BRACE AND CO., INC. | COPYRIGHT, 1947, BY RANDOM HOUSE, INC. | FIRST *Modern Library* EDITION, 1947; v–vii FOREWORD signed p. vii: CLIFTON FADIMAN | *June, 1947*; [viii] blank; 1–377 text; [378] blank; [379–384] ML list. (*Fall 1947*) \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in vivid red (11), grayish yellow-green (122), moderate olive green (125) and black on coated white paper with illustration of a man with pipe and cap standing at the rail of a ship with a gull in the foreground and the Statue of Liberty and more gulls in the background; author in black on vivid red patches, title in reverse, other lettering in black. \n\n> Front flap:<br> The 1930 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature is now represented in the Modern Library series by three novels. The first two (*Arrowsmith* No. 42 and *Babbitt* No. 162) have maintained, year after year, a commanding place among the most popular books on the list. Now *Dodsworth*, Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape from the tensions of industrialism and in revolt against European patronage of America, is given permanence among the best of the world’s best books. Clifton Fadiman contributes a sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his Foreword. (*Fall 1947*) \n\n> Front flap rewritten:<br> Sinclair Lewis’s study of the American magnate in search of escape from the tensions of his own industrial empire and in revolt against the patronizing attitudes of Europeans toward Americans is one of his most enduring novels. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930 is nowhere so critical of his own countrymen and nowhere so proud of their genuine attainments. In this respect *Dodsworth* is a novel of protest and yet of irony; it represents Sinclair Lewis at his best as an observer and as a satirist. Clifton Fadiman contributes a perceptive and sympathetic appraisal of Sinclair Lewis’s work in his Foreword. (*Spring 1962*) \n\nOriginally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. 1–377) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1947. *WR* 10 January 1948. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nAfter following his editor, Harry Maule, from Doubleday to Random House, Lewis expressed the hope that *Dodsworth* could be added to the ML alongside *Arrowsmith* (254) and *Babbitt* (348). The ML tried to secure reprint rights in 1941, but negotiations with Harcourt, Brace were unsuccessful. Lewis then suggested *Elmer* *Gantry*, which apparently would have been available, but Cerf thought that any of his major works would be preferable (Lewis to Maule, 26 June 1941; Maule memo to Cerf, 27 June 1941; Maule to Lewis, 8 July 1941). Five years later Cerf approached Harcourt, Brace again, pointing out that Lewis was anxious to have *Dodsworth* in the series (Cerf to Spencer Scott, Harcourt, Brace, 6 September 1946). This time he was successful, and the ML secured U.S. and Canadian reprint rights. \n\n#### 400b. Title page with Fujita torchbearer; 7½ inch format (1969/70) \n\nTitle as 400a through line 5; lines 6–8: [torchbearer K] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | NEW YORK. \n\nPagination as 400a. [1]<sup>16</sup> [2–5]<sup>32</sup> [6]<sup>4</sup> [7]<sup>32</sup> [8]<sup>16</sup> \n\nContents as 400a except: [iv] *First* statement omitted; [379–380] ML Giants list; [381–384] blank. (*Spring 1967*) \n\n*Jacket:* Fujita pictorial jacket in strong yellowish brown (74) and black on coated white paper with inset photographic portrait of Lewis in strong yellowish brown and black; lettering below portrait with SINCLAIR LEWIS outlined in reverse, title in black capitals, and statement “With a Foreword by Clifton Fadiman” in black, all within single-rule frame in reverse against strong yellowish brown background. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Lewis’ study of a Midwestern automobile magnate abroad ranks, with *Main Street*, *Babbitt*, and *Arrowsmith*, as a classic of American realism. These earlier novels exposed a narrow, provincial, materialist America—and cries of outrage did not prevent Lewis’ Zenith, his Babbitts and Gantrys, from becoming part of the American language and consciousness. \n> In *Dodsworth* he explores possibilities for regeneration and growth. Samuel Dodsworth, perhaps the most sympathetic character to emerge from Zenith, makes, with his wife, the time-honored pilgrimage to Europe—and what was intended as a vacation becomes a forced examination of a life too narrowly lived, of a marriage too fragile to sustain the pressures and temptations of a year’s leisure. Dodsworth’s honesty and his courage throughout his ordeal allow him to survive and to grow—and in this last of Lewis’ pre-Depression novels, satire is balanced by a cautious optimism. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nSinclair Lewis, *Arrowsmith* (1933– ) 254 \nSinclair Lewis, *Babbitt* (1942– ) 348 \nSinclair Lewis, *Cass Timberlane* (1957– ) 499 \n\n",
