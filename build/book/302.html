<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> To judge by the avalanche of biographies, memoirs and critical works which have appeared since his death, no writer of our time has had a more profound influence on his contemporaries than D. H. Lawrence. Among his own novels, <em>Sons and Lovers</em> (No. 109) and <em>The Rainbow</em> (No. 128) have maintained his reputation as the grand inquisitor into the dark labyrinths of the human soul. Now <em>Women in Love</em> takes its place by their side in the Modern Library series as the third of his novels dealing with the physical and mystical urgency of love. (<em>Spring 1937</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published in New York by Thomas Seltzer in a “privately printed” edition of 1250 copies for subscribers only, with 50 copies signed by Lawrence, 1920. Trade edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, published in U.S. by Seltzer, 1922; publishing rights and plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [xi]–548) printed from Seltzer/Viking plates. Published April 1937. <em>WR</em> 24 April 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s foreword was originally published in 1920 as an advertising leaflet for Seltzer’s first printing of <em>Women in Love</em> (Roberts, p. 39). The acknowledgment on p. [v] of the ML edition states, “The manuscript of the Foreword for this volume is in the possession of the Stanford University Library. It is published here by courtesy of Gelber, Lilienthal, Inc., of San Francisco.”</p>
<p><em>Women in Love</em> sold 4,736 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the same period the ML editions of <em>Sons and Lovers</em> (99) and <em>The Rainbow</em> (138) sold 6,808 copies and 3,565 copies respectively. <em>Women in Love</em> sold 3,313 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it ninety-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap revised:<br> During his brief but stormy and prolific writing career and in the years following his death in 1930, D. H. Lawrence stirred up many fierce literary controversies. An avalanche of biographies, memoirs and critical works showed how much partisanship and antagonism he inspired among his contemporaries. Now, in the perspective of a quarter of a century, three of his novels, <em>Sons and Lovers</em> (No. 109), <em>The Rainbow</em> (No. 128) and <em>Women in Love</em> (No. 68), offer the best testimony to clarify his position as a writer who explored the darker labyrinths of the human soul. <em>Women in Love</em>, particularly, is characteristic of Lawrence’s work dealing with the physical and mystical urgency of love.

<p><em>Jacket D:</em> Non-pictorial on kraft paper with lettering in dark reddish brown (44) and torchbearer in deep brown (56). Designed by R. D. Scudellari.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Although <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em> is probably Lawrence’s most famous novel, <em>Women in Love</em> is unquestionably one of his two or three finest. Many critics in fact believe that it is the most profound investigation of his lifelong preoccupation with the relationships between the sexes and between man and nature. The story of two sisters, Ursula and Gudrun, and their love affairs with Birkin and Gerald, it contrasts the two relationships—Gudrun and Gerald’s, which is icy, sterile and doomed; and Ursula and Birkin’s, which is fruitful and transcendent.</p>

Unsigned.   \n\n> Front flap:<br> To judge by the avalanche of biographies, memoirs and critical works which have appeared since his death, no writer of our time has had a more profound influence on his contemporaries than D. H. Lawrence. Among his own novels, *Sons and Lovers* (No. 109) and *The Rainbow* (No. 128) have maintained his reputation as the grand inquisitor into the dark labyrinths of the human soul. Now *Women in Love* takes its place by their side in the Modern Library series as the third of his novels dealing with the physical and mystical urgency of love. (*Spring 1937*)   \n\nOriginally published in New York by Thomas Seltzer in a “privately printed” edition of 1250 copies for subscribers only, with 50 copies signed by Lawrence, 1920. Trade edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, published in U.S. by Seltzer, 1922; publishing rights and plates subsequently acquired by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [xi]–548) printed from Seltzer/Viking plates. Published April 1937. *WR* 24 April 1937. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990.   \n\nLawrence’s foreword was originally published in 1920 as an advertising leaflet for Seltzer’s first printing of *Women in Love* (Roberts, p. 39). The acknowledgment on p. [v] of the ML edition states, “The manuscript of the Foreword for this volume is in the possession of the Stanford University Library. It is published here by courtesy of Gelber, Lilienthal, Inc., of San Francisco.”   \n\n*Women in Love* sold 4,736 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the same period the ML editions of *Sons and Lovers* (99) and *The Rainbow* (138) sold 6,808 copies and 3,565 copies respectively. *Women in Love* sold 3,313 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it ninety-sixth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.   \n\n#### 302b.

(*Spring 1946*)   \n\n> Front flap revised:<br> During his brief but stormy and prolific writing career and in the years following his death in 1930, D. H. Lawrence stirred up many fierce literary controversies. An avalanche of biographies, memoirs and critical works showed how much partisanship and antagonism he inspired among his contemporaries. Now, in the perspective of a quarter of a century, three of his novels, *Sons and Lovers* (No. 109), *The Rainbow* (No. 128) and *Women in Love* (No. 68), offer the best testimony to clarify his position as a writer who explored the darker labyrinths of the human soul. *Women in Love*, particularly, is characteristic of Lawrence’s work dealing with the physical and mystical urgency of love.

Many critics in fact believe that it is the most profound investigation of his lifelong preoccupation with the relationships between the sexes and between man and nature. The story of two sisters, Ursula and Gudrun, and their love affairs with Birkin and Gerald, it contrasts the two relationships—Gudrun and Gerald’s, which is icy, sterile and doomed; and Ursula and Birkin’s, which is fruitful and transcendent.   \n\nPublished fall 1977 at \\$5.95.
