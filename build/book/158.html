<p><strong>LAURENCE STERNE. TRISTRAM SHANDY. 1928–1970. (ML 147)</strong></p>
<h4>158.1a. First printing (1928)</h4>
<p>[within double rules] TRISTRAM SHANDY | [rule] | BY | LAURENCE STERNE | [rule] | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/A2.webp'>torchbearer A2</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK</p>

(<em>Spring 1928</em>) <em>Note:</em> The ML list on pp. [593–596] is an inserted fold tipped in at the end of the last gathering. Some copies of the first printing lack the ML list. This is the only known example of a ML list that is not printed as part of the final gathering. Cerf and Klopfer may have decided that as long as they were tipping in a leaf of marbled paper they might as well tip in a ML list at the end of the volume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> Pp. [<em>10</em>], 1–270, 281–591 [592]. [1–18]<sup>16</sup> [19]<sup>8</sup>. Contents as 158.1a except: [<em>2</em>] <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='publishers note' src='/mlb/images/notes/D12.webp'>pub. note D12</uvalib-modal-image-button>; [<em>4</em>] <em>First</em> statement omitted; leaf of marbled paper omitted. (<em>Spring 1929 jacket</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:
The Modern Library edition of Laurence Sterne’s immortal “Tristram Shandy” is complete and unabridged in this one volume—with every one of the author’s most unusual directions to the printer followed in minute detail. (<em>Spring 1928</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:
Although the first part of “Tristram Shandy” appeared as long ago as 1760, the editors of the Modern Library feel that they need offer no explanation for its inclusion in a series of latterday classics. Could any writing be more modern in spirit than Laurence Sterne’s—more singularly frank and unconventional? Toby Shandy is a character that will remain universally lovable and admirable for all time. (<em>1928)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front as jacket A. (<em>Spring 1929</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:
A world deprived of the joyous and audacious spirit of <em>Tristram Shandy</em> would be unthinkable. For two centuries Laurence Sterne’s irrepressible book has served as an unfailing antidote for dullness and pomposity. Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety. Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete and unabridged version. (<em>Spring 1934)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for April 1928. <em>WR</em> 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is traditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its inclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R.  H. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury the ML abandoned after the first printing.</p>
<p>The omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of <em>Tristam Shandy</em> traditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There is no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there is a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the book by it . . .” (p. 281).</p>
<p><em>Tristram Shandy</em> was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the first six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>

<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in strong green (141), light yellowish pink (28) and black on coated white paper depicting a man in spectacles and wig; title and author in reverse with title on diagonal axis, other lettering in black, all against strong green background. Signed: E. McKnight Kauffer. The figure depicted on the jacket bears some resemblance to Joshua Reynolds’s portrait of Sterne, but it is not clear whether it is meant to be Sterne or Tristram Shandy. Kauffer’s illustration was also used in 1941 on the jacket of the ML Giant edition of <em>Tristram Shandy &amp; A Sentimental Journey</em> (G54) with the background in dark red.</p>

First printing (1928)  \n\n[within double rules] TRISTRAM SHANDY | [rule] | BY | LAURENCE STERNE | [rule] | [torchbearer A2] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY | PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK  \n\nPp.

(*Spring 1928*) *Note:* The ML list on pp. [593–596] is an inserted fold tipped in at the end of the last gathering. Some copies of the first printing lack the ML list. This is the only known example of a ML list that is not printed as part of the final gathering. Cerf and Klopfer may have decided that as long as they were tipping in a leaf of marbled paper they might as well tip in a ML list at the end of the volume.  \n\n> *Variant:* Pp. [*10*], 1–270, 281–591 [592]. [1–18]<sup>16</sup> [19]<sup>8</sup>. Contents as 158.1a except: [*2*] pub. note D12; [*4*] *First* statement omitted; leaf of marbled paper omitted. (*Spring 1929 jacket*)  \n\n*Jacket A:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n>Text on front:\nThe Modern Library edition of Laurence Sterne’s immortal “Tristram Shandy” is complete and unabridged in this one volume—with every one of the author’s most unusual directions to the printer followed in minute detail. (*Spring 1928*)  \n\n*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket B2.  \n\n>Text on front:\nAlthough the first part of “Tristram Shandy” appeared as long ago as 1760, the editors of the Modern Library feel that they need offer no explanation for its inclusion in a series of latterday classics. Could any writing be more modern in spirit than Laurence Sterne’s—more singularly frank and unconventional? Toby Shandy is a character that will remain universally lovable and admirable for all time. (*1928)*  \n\n*Jacket C:* Uniform typographic jacket D. Text on front as jacket A. (*Spring 1929*)  \n\n>Front flap:\nA world deprived of the joyous and audacious spirit of *Tristram Shandy* would be unthinkable. For two centuries Laurence Sterne’s irrepressible book has served as an unfailing antidote for dullness and pomposity. Its whimsicality and its gusto, its playful digressions and its quaint irrelevancies have contributed to the world’s gaiety. Because it is a classic that retains all the freshness and buoyancy of temper that the present-day reader demands, the Modern Library fulfils its mission by presenting Sterne’s incomparable work in its complete and unabridged version. (*Spring 1934)*  \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for April 1928. *WR* 9 June 1928. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nThe leaf of marbled paper mentioned in the text (p. 202) is traditionally included in finer editions. Klopfer thought that its inclusion in the ML edition was “the height of luxury” (Klopfer to R.  H. Wilkinson, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 June 1928). It was a luxury the ML abandoned after the first printing.  \n\nThe omission of pp. 271–280 is deliberate. Printings of *Tristam Shandy* traditionally skip ten pages between Book IV, Chapters 23 and 25. There is no Chapter 24. The text of Chapter 25 begins, “—No doubt, Sir,—there is a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the book by it . . .” (p. 281).  \n\n*Tristram Shandy* was the 17th best-selling title in the ML during the first six months of 1928. During the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 it ranked high in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  \n\n#### 158.1b.

Signed: E. McKnight Kauffer. The figure depicted on the jacket bears some resemblance to Joshua Reynolds’s portrait of Sterne, but it is not clear whether it is meant to be Sterne or Tristram Shandy. Kauffer’s illustration was also used in 1941 on the jacket of the ML Giant edition of *Tristram Shandy & A Sentimental Journey* (G54) with the background in dark red. \n> Front flap as 158.1a jacket B.
