A PUBLISHER’S NOTE | ON THE MODERN LIBRARY EDITION | OF “SISTER CARRIE”; [viii] blank; [<em>1</em>] fly title; [<em>2</em>] blank; [1]–557 text; [558] blank; [559–563] ML list; [564–566] blank. (<em>Spring 1932</em>) <em>Note:</em> To accommodate Dreiser’s plates the ML edition was ¼ inch taller than the ML’s standard format; later printings in the balloon cloth format were also ¼ inch wider. See the note directly below under 230a variant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> Wider format with binding measuring 6⅞ x 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm). Pagination and collation as 230a. Contents as 230a except p. [iv] entirely reset with transcription as 230a except first comma in line 2 in italic and <em>First</em> statement omitted; [564–565] ML Giants list; [566] blank. (<em>Fall 1939</em>) <em>Note:</em> The wider format may have been introduced well before 1939. The wider format allowed more generous inside and outer margins. It also meant that the endpapers extended beyond Kent’s endpaper design, leaving a white border of more than ⅛ inch at the fore-edge of the free endpapers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in moderate reddish purple (258) and black on cream paper depicting a woman’s head and shoulders in left profile; borders in moderate reddish purple, lettering in black. Signed C. (<em>Spring 1932</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The story of the vicissitudes attendant upon the publisher’s suppression, in 1901, of <em>Sister Carrie</em> is the history of America’s emergence from the fog of suspicion and fear of realism in the novel. On the score of his uncompromising fight, Theodore Dreiser must be regarded a pioneer and liberator. His <em>Sister Carrie</em> pointed the tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown internationally famous. (<em>Fall 1933</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired the Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W. Dodge &amp; Co., 1907; Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1908; Harper &amp; Bros., 1912; and Boni &amp; Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. [<em>1</em>]–557) printed from Dreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. <em>WR</em> 12 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.</p>
<p>Dreiser’s account of the original publication of <em>Sister Carrie</em>, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it was rejected by Harper &amp; Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday, Page at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a reader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include <em>selling</em>; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred of them. (p. vi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html">James L. W. West III</a> notes:</p>
<p>Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a vacation and read <em>Sister Carrie</em> in typescript. Perhaps his wife read the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication. Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed to putting <em>Sister Carrie</em> into print, but that he was under no obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and Publication of <em>Sister Carrie</em>”, Dreiser Web Source, University of Pennsylvania Library, 2000).</p>
<p>Doubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of <em>Sister Carrie</em> and left 450 unbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. <em>Sister Carrie</em> sold 456 copies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and Dreiser received royalties of $68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates that the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies of <em>Sister Carrie</em> were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor &amp; Company (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later purchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of <em>Sister Carrie</em>, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.</p>
<p>The ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a $2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid $500 of the advance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates which had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited to Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML edition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania. Dreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing was required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions for the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s death the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser Papers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).</p>
<p>Dreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was originally published in <em>The Colophon</em>, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s Note on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser, however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements covering the two-fifty edition [the trade edition published by Boni &amp; Liveright in 1917], and it was only in February, 1932, after more attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sister Carrie</em> was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the 1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies by the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of $636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). <em>Sister Carrie</em> sold 5,637 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.</p>

<p>Front flap reset and revised:<br>
The history of the vicissitudes attending upon the suppression, in 1901, of <em>Sister Carrie</em> is part of the history of America’s emergence from the then prevailing atmosphere of prudery and suspicion. Fear of realism in the novel prompted the campaign against writers who dared challenge the romantic tradition. On the score of his uncompromising fight against censorship and for the new and rising school of American naturalism, Theodore Dreiser earned the right to be regarded as a pioneer and liberator. His <em>Sister Carrie</em> was the forerunner of a tendency in American fiction for at least a quarter of a century and even today it remains a monumental achievement as a novel of great sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness. For these qualities alone Theodore Dreiser became internationally famous. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>

(*Fall 1939*) *Note:* The wider format may have been introduced well before 1939. The wider format allowed more generous inside and outer margins. It also meant that the endpapers extended beyond Kent’s endpaper design, leaving a white border of more than ⅛ inch at the fore-edge of the free endpapers.  \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate reddish purple (258) and black on cream paper depicting a woman’s head and shoulders in left profile; borders in moderate reddish purple, lettering in black. Signed C. (*Spring 1932*)  \n\n> Front flap:<br> The story of the vicissitudes attendant upon the publisher’s suppression, in 1901, of *Sister Carrie* is the history of America’s emergence from the fog of suspicion and fear of realism in the novel. On the score of his uncompromising fight, Theodore Dreiser must be regarded a pioneer and liberator. His *Sister Carrie* pointed the tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown internationally famous. (*Fall 1933*)  \n\nOriginally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired the Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W. Dodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and Boni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. [*1*]–557) printed from Dreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  \n\nDreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it was rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday, Page at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a reader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:  \n\n> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred of them. (p. vi)  \n\n[James L. W. West III](http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/dreiser/contributors.html) notes:  \n\nFrank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication. Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of Pennsylvania Library, 2000).  \n\nDoubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450 unbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456 copies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and Dreiser received royalties of \\$68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates that the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies of *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor & Company (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later purchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister Carrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.  \n\nThe ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a \\$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid \\$500 of the advance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates which had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited to Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML edition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania. Dreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing was required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions for the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s death the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser Papers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).  \n\nDreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was originally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s Note on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:  \n\n> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser, however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements covering the two-fifty edition [the trade edition published by Boni & Liveright in 1917], and it was only in February, 1932, after more attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.  \n\n*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the 1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies by the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of \\$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.  \n\n#### 230b.

Fear of realism in the novel prompted the campaign against writers who dared challenge the romantic tradition. On the score of his uncompromising fight against censorship and for the new and rising school of American naturalism, Theodore Dreiser earned the right to be regarded as a pioneer and liberator. His *Sister Carrie* was the forerunner of a tendency in American fiction for at least a quarter of a century and even today it remains a monumental achievement as a novel of great sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness. For these qualities alone Theodore Dreiser became internationally famous.
