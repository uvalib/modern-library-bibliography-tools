<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Spring 1930</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap: <br> As eminent among modern dramatists as he is among short-story writers, Anton Tchekov is here represented by seven of his most important plays. For their penetrating revelation of character, for their sharp and poignant situations and for their compassionate understanding, these plays embody the method and the spirit that have made Tchekov world famous. His ability to convert commonplace events into universal experience, his pervasive humor and his unfailing insight make him not only one of the greatest of dramatists, but also one of the most revered. (<em>Fall 1936</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B1:</em> Pictorial in vivid red (11), black and gold on coated white paper with drawing of Russian city with bridge over a river on inset vivid red panel; lettering on panel in black except author in reverse, background in black lined in gold. Designed by Paul Galdone, October 1937, for <em>Stories of Anton Tchekov</em> (232b jacket B); unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap as 193a. (<em>Spring 1939</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Superseded by Chekhov, <em>Best Plays</em>, trans. Stark Young (1956–86) 487</p>
<p><em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em> ranked in the third quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952.</p>
<p>The ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to <em>The Plays of Anton Tchekov</em> (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to “Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of <em>Best Plays</em>.</p>

Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file).
