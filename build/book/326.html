<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in deep blue (179), pale blue (185) strong red (12), moderate red (15), pale yellow (89), medium gray (265) and black on coated white paper depicting a street of Boston town houses highlighted in strong and moderate red and a passing pedestrian with walking cane with pavement in pale yellow; title in reverse highlighted in black against background fading from deep blue to pale yellow; other lettering in black. Designed by Paul Galdone in November 1939; unsigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The Pulitzer Prize Novel for 1938, <em>The Late George Apley</em>, is a delicious satire on the palmy days of Boston during America’s golden era. Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s discomfiture, you will relish the rich portrait of a New England family set against a background of Puritanism. The tone throughout this book is gentle, compassionate and ironic; the total effect is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a warmly human American way of life. (<em>Spring 1940</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flap text revised:  <br> The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel for 1938, <em>The Late George Apley</em> is a deft and devastating satire on the most proper of Bostonians when they were the self-appointed guardians of America’s social and intellectual destiny. Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s pretensions and his discomfiture, you will relish this rich portrait of a New England family with its background of rigid Puritanism. The tone throughout this novel is gentle, compassionate and ironic; its total purpose and achievement is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a passing but still warmly human American way of life. (<em>Fall 1956</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1937. ML edition (pp. [v]–354) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published January 1940. <em>WR</em> 27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>The ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The initial reprint contract was for a period of three years and appears to have given the ML exclusive reprint rights. When the contract was renewed Little, Brown added a stipulation that gave them the option of authorizing a Pocket Books paperback edition (Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, to Cerf, 29 September 1943). The ML edition sold 6,118 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles during this eighteen-month period. Sales to September 1943 totaled 13,450 copies (Cerf to Elizabeth Marden, Little, Brown, 24 September 1943).</p>

(*Spring 1940*)  \n\n> Flap text revised:  <br> The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel for 1938, *The Late George Apley* is a deft and devastating satire on the most proper of Bostonians when they were the self-appointed guardians of America’s social and intellectual destiny. Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s pretensions and his discomfiture, you will relish this rich portrait of a New England family with its background of rigid Puritanism. The tone throughout this novel is gentle, compassionate and ironic; its total purpose and achievement is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a passing but still warmly human American way of life. (*Fall 1956*)  \n\nOriginally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1937. ML edition (pp. [v]–354) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published January 1940. *WR* 27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The initial reprint contract was for a period of three years and appears to have given the ML exclusive reprint rights. When the contract was renewed Little, Brown added a stipulation that gave them the option of authorizing a Pocket Books paperback edition (Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, to Cerf, 29 September 1943). The ML edition sold 6,118 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles during this eighteen-month period. Sales to September 1943 totaled 13,450 copies (Cerf to Elizabeth Marden, Little, Brown, 24 September 1943).  \n\n#### 326b.

(*Spring 1940*)  \n\n> Flap text revised:  <br> The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel for 1938, *The Late George Apley* is a deft and devastating satire on the most proper of Bostonians when they were the self-appointed guardians of America’s social and intellectual destiny. Laugh as much as you like at George Apley’s pretensions and his discomfiture, you will relish this rich portrait of a New England family with its background of rigid Puritanism. The tone throughout this novel is gentle, compassionate and ironic; its total purpose and achievement is entertainment of the highest order and a new and unforgettable insight into a passing but still warmly human American way of life. (*Fall 1956*)  \n\nOriginally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1937. ML edition (pp. [v]–354) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published January 1940. *WR* 27 January 1940. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  \n\nThe ML paid Little, Brown royalties of 10 cents a copy. The initial reprint contract was for a period of three years and appears to have given the ML exclusive reprint rights. When the contract was renewed Little, Brown added a stipulation that gave them the option of authorizing a Pocket Books paperback edition (Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, to Cerf, 29 September 1943). The ML edition sold 6,118 copies between 1 May 1942 and 1 November 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML titles during this eighteen-month period. Sales to September 1943 totaled 13,450 copies (Cerf to Elizabeth Marden, Little, Brown, 24 September 1943).  \n\n"
