<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> To bring within the compass of one volume the best of the essays written by Michel de Montaigne in a translation that is both faithful and modern has long been the aim of the editors of this series. The existing English renderings are either so archaic or are sometimes so colloquial as to lose some of the original nuances of meaning. Accordingly, with the William Hazlitt [Charles Cotton–W. C. Hazlitt] translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and modernized collection in language that retains the substance and conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay form. (<em>Fall 1949; [Spring 1956]</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published fall 1949. <em>WR</em> 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Montaigne’s <em>Essays</em> had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first in the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation, and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947). He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged. The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United States. Because there was some question of British rights, we voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29 September 1947).</p>
<p>Bates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century translation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the public domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the original and to give the best possible modern rendering.”</p>
<p>Bates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt translation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the Editor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised it, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to the accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to modernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the translation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]). Bates did not consider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement “completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of the title page be omitted.</p>
<p>The manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have been delivered until the following spring. Bates received $500 for his editorial work plus $144 to cover half of the typing costs.</p>
<p>Bates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included the essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion of sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain in language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one of the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and quotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed. If you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to Commins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in fact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or, if included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948).</p>
<h4>419b. Title page corrected (early 1950s)</h4>
<p>Title as 419a except line 5: <em>The Charles Cotten–W. Hazlitt Translation,</em></p>
<p>Pagination as 419a. [1]<sup>16</sup> [2–10]<sup>32</sup> [11]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Contents as 419a except: [iv] <em>First</em> statement omitted; [vii] EDITOR’S NOTE with additional paragraph and footnote; [603–604] ML Giants list. (<em>Fall 1960</em>)</p>
<p>In 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern Library College Edition, for which he received $50. He also submitted a list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s.</p>
<p>Stein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s translation of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal, Letters</em> (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3 November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion. If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s <em>Complete Essays</em> in 1958, may not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money.</p>

The existing English renderings are either so archaic or are sometimes so colloquial as to lose some of the original nuances of meaning. Accordingly, with the William Hazlitt [Charles Cotton–W. C. Hazlitt] translation as a basis, Professor Blanchard Bates of the Department of Romance Languages, Princeton University, here undertakes a revised and modernized collection in language that retains the substance and conveys the spirit of the French originator and master of the essay form. (*Fall 1949; [Spring 1956]*) \n\nOriginal ML collection. Publication announced for spring 1949; published fall 1949. *WR* 10 December 1949. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71; retained in MLCE. \n\nMontaigne’s *Essays* had been available as a ML Giant since 1933, first in the Florio translation and then in the Trechmann translation. Oxford University Press objected to the ML’s use of the Trechmann translation, and the ML agreed in 1946 to withdraw it when the first printing was exhausted (see G10.2). The following year Commins and Cerf began to think about adding Montaigne to the regular ML. Commins suggested Bates as editor and indicated, “He would use, for purposes of copyright protection, the Hazlitt translation, which is considered modern and quite as good as Trechmann” (Commins memo to Cerf, 18 September 1947). He then wrote to Bates: “For many years we maintained in the Modern Library Giant series the Florio translation, complete and unabridged. The archaic rendering vitiated its usefulness; accordingly we replaced it with the Trechmann translation, in public domain in the United States. Because there was some question of British rights, we voluntarily withdrew this volume from the series and are now in search of a replacement in the smaller Modern Library format. The only available ‘modern’ translation, to our knowledge, is the Hazlitt in four volumes. . . . do you consider it faithful enough to the original and comparable in modernity to the Trechmann?” (Commins to Bates, 29 September 1947). \n\nBates replied that Hazlitt’s revision of the seventeenth-century translation of Charles Cotton was the only modern translation in the public domain. He did not consider it comparable in modernity or readability to Trechmann and recommended a limited revision of the Hazlitt translation. He anticipated that the revision would require at least a month of solid work (Bates to Commins, 12 October 1947). The contract, dated 12 November 1947, left the selection of essays entirely to Bates and called for him to “make such revisions in the text as you deem necessary to make it conform to the spirit and letter of the original and to give the best possible modern rendering.” \n\nBates omitted Latin quotations in the original where the Cotton–Hazlitt translation gave them in both Latin and English. He stated in the Editor’s Note: “The editor has examined the Hazlitt text and has revised it, whenever he considered it necessary, in order to make it conform to the accepted French texts, to eliminate inaccurate translation, to modernize some of the English, and to make corrections in the translation of Latin quotations. His intent has been to let the text stand unaltered whenever possible; however, it has been necessary to do considerable revising of the translation” (p. [vii]). Bates did not consider his work to be a complete revision and asked that the statement “completely revised and modernized” which appeared on the first proof of the title page be omitted. \n\nThe manuscript was due in September 1948 but does not appear to have been delivered until the following spring. Bates received \\$500 for his editorial work plus \\$144 to cover half of the typing costs. \n\nBates thought it necessary to point out to Commins that he had included the essay “On Some Verses of Virgil” which contained “a frank discussion of sex, of women’s position etc. There are passages that are very plain in language. In our age of Kinsey reports I saw no reason to exclude one of the best essays simply on the grounds that it introduces remarks and quotations that are more often turned over in the mind than expressed. If you have any misgivings . . . I should like to know” (Bates to Commins, 10 November 1948). Commins replied, “I have no misgivings; in fact I would be terribly disappointed if such an essay were omitted or, if included, it were castrated” (Commins to Bates, 12 November 1948). \n\n#### 419b. Title page corrected (early 1950s) \n\nTitle as 419a except line 5: *The Charles Cotten–W. Hazlitt Translation,* \n\nPagination as 419a. [1]<sup>16</sup> [2–10]<sup>32</sup> [11]<sup>16</sup> \n\nContents as 419a except: [iv] *First* statement omitted; [vii] EDITOR’S NOTE with additional paragraph and footnote; [603–604] ML Giants list. (*Fall 1960*) \n\nIn 1950 Bates prepared a brief bibliography for an anticipated Modern Library College Edition, for which he received \\$50. He also submitted a list of corrections to the text. Projections for MLCE were subsequently cut back and Stein informed Bates in 1951, “Our present plans do not include the publication of this book in the College Editions within the near future. We will, of course, continue to publish the College Editions but we will not be able to issue as many new titles each year as we have in the past.” Stein indicated that the corrections would be incorporated in the next printing of the regular ML edition (Stein to Bates, 26 November 1951). Montaigne was added to MLCE in the mid-1950s. \n\nStein considered the Cotton-Hazlitt-Bates translation “not outrageously bad, but not particularly good either.” He recommended that the ML consider replacing it with a volume based on Donald M. Frame’s translation of Montaigne’s *Complete Works: Essays, Travel Journal, Letters* (Stanford University Press, 1957), which he called “probably the definitive English translation for our time” (Stein memo to Cerf, 3 November 1958). It is not known if Cerf followed up on this suggestion. If he did, Stanford University Press, which published a separate edition of Frame’s translations of Montaigne’s *Complete Essays* in 1958, may not have been receptive or may have asked for too much money. \n\n<span class=\"smallcaps\">Also in the Modern Library</span> \nMontaigne, *Essays*, Florio translation (1933–1945) G10.1 \nMontaigne, *Essays*, Trechmann translation (1946–1948) G10.2 \n\n",
