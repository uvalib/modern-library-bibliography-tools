<p><strong>BUDD SCHULBERG. WHAT MAKES SAMMY RUN? 1952–1970. (ML 281)</strong></p>
<h4><a href='/revision/449.html'>449. First printing (1952) </a></h4>
<p><em>what</em> | <em>makes</em> | <em>sammy</em> | <em>run?</em> | <em>by</em> BUDD SCHULBERG | WITH A NEW INTRODUCTION BY THE AUTHOR | [<uvalib-modal-image-button alt='torchbearer' src='/mlb/images/torchbearers/D3.webp'>torchbearer D3</uvalib-modal-image-button>] | [rule] | THE MODERN LIBRARY · NEW YORK | [rule]</p>
<p>Pp. [i–vi] vii–xiv, [1–2] 3–303 [304–306]. [1–10]<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>[i] half title; [ii] blank; [iii] title; [iv] <em>Copyright, 1941, 1952, by Budd Schulberg</em> | <em>First Modern Library Edition, 1952</em>; [v] dedication; [vi] blank; vii–xiv INTRODUCTION | <em>by Budd Schulberg</em> dated p. xiv: New Hope, Penna. | <em>January, 1952</em>; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–303 text; [304–306] blank. <em>Note:</em> <em>First</em> statement retained on printings through spring 1956.</p>
<p><em>Jacket:</em> Pictorial in brilliant yellow (83) and black on coated white paper with photographic illustration in black and yellow of a couple silhouetted on hilltop overlooking Los Angeles with the lights of the city in yellow; title at top in reverse, author and series in black on wide yellow band at foot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Of the writing of books on Hollywood there has been no end. The only one that has maintained its permanence as a document and a dramatic revelation of the drives, hopes and frustrations of the film colony is <em>What Makes Sammy Run?</em> Budd Schulberg’s chronicle of the shady opportunist in the land of flickering shadows has become part of the established folklore of America. The question in his title has been incorporated into our common language and the name of Sammy Glick has become the accepted symbol for the aggressive and ruthless hustler and careerist. For the Modern Library edition of <em>What Makes Sammy Run?</em> the author contributes a new and illuminating introduction. (<em>Spring 1952</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally published by Random House, 1941. ML edition (pp. [1]–303) printed from RH plates with the dedication on p. [v] changed from “For Jigge” to “For Saxe Commins.” Published spring 1952. <em>WR</em> 5 April 1952. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. <em>Note:</em> Jigge was Schulberg’s daughter by his first wife.</p>
<p>The ML paid Schulberg royalties of 6 cents a copy. Schulberg asked that the ML edition be dedicated to Commins (Schulberg to Cerf, 11 October 1951). The introduction was originally dated October 20, 1951; Commins changed the date to one closer to publication (Commins to Schulberg, 23 October 1951). The ML edition sold 11,300 copies through the end of 1955 (Commins to Alice Hackett, 15 March 1956).</p>
