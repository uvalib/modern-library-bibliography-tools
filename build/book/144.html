<blockquote>
<p><em>Variant:</em> Pp. [i–iv] v–vii [viii], 1–592 [593–600]. [1–19]<sup>16</sup>. Contents as 144a except: [ii] <uvalib-modal-image-button alt='publishers note' src='/mlb/images/notes/A6.webp'>pub. note A6</uvalib-modal-image-button>; [593–597] ML list; [598–600] blank. (<em>Fall 1931</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket A:</em> Uniform typographic jacket B2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text on front:<br> RICHARD FEVEREL is the first, as it is doubtless the favorite, of the astonishing succession of novels which placed Meredith among the demigods of English literature. Its essential theme is the question of a boy’s education, and the abortive attempt of a proud and opinionated father, hide-bound by theory and precept, to bring up his son through a system which controls all his early circumstances and represses many of the natural and wholesome impulses of adolescence.
The Modern Library reprints RICHARD FEVEREL from the first edition of the book, retaining all the passages written in the full glow and vigor of his prime, that Meredith excised in some of the later editions of the book. (<em>Fall 1927</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jacket B:</em> Uniform typographic jacket D. (<em>Fall 1930</em>)</p>
<p><em>Jacket C:</em> Pictorial in moderate yellow green (120) and black on cream paper depicting a young man earnestly clasping the hand of a young woman standing by a garden turnstile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Enthusiasts for the novels of George Meredith stand firm in their preference for <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>. Unanimously they agree that this study of adolescence is more than a penetrating psychological document; it is a vivid and absorbing dramatization of the conflict between two generations, made memorable by a glowing passion. After the first edition of <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>, several passages, essential to its full appreciation, were deleted. These have been entirely restored in the Modern Library version. (<em>Spring 1935</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap rewritten:<br> Devoted readers of the novels of George Meredith insist upon their preference for <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>. Its appeal is ageless because it is a tale of adolescence and young love overcoming the prejudices and obstructions of an older generation; it is a psychological study as well as an idyll of youth. Written a century ago, this romantic story of thwarted and triumphant love still retains the glow of the best of the novels of this genre of its period. After the first edition of <em>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</em>, several passages, essential to its full appreciation, were deleted in subsequent printings. These have been entirely restored in the Modern Library volume. (<em>Spring 1956</em>)</p>

Unanimously they agree that this study of adolescence is more than a penetrating psychological document; it is a vivid and absorbing dramatization of the conflict between two generations, made memorable by a glowing passion.
