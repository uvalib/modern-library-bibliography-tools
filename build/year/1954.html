<h1>MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1954</h1>
<h2>1954</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>In 1954, Random House entered into negotiations with Allen Lane, the founder and head of Penguin Books in England, to explore the possibility of Random House’s acquiring the American branch of the firm. Initially, Random House was attracted by the idea of obtaining rights for the Modern Library of a number of new translations commissioned for Penguin Classics, a distinguished and highly successful series that began in 1946. Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had been criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux’s 1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes’s <em>Don Quixote</em>; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; Constance Garnett’s translation of Chekhov’s <em>Plays</em>; and anonymous translations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had superior translations of these and other works.</p>
<p>In March 1954, Klopfer received a letter from Milton Waldman of the British publishing firm Rupert Hart-Davis, who wrote that Lane had expressed an interest in arranging for joint publication of various classics with the Modern Library (Milton Waldman to Klopfer, 31 March 1954). Jess Stein was given the job of examining the translations in Penguin Classics. He prepared a long memorandum for Klopfer in which he indicated which Penguin translations would be desirable for the Modern Library. However, nothing came of the negotiations with Lane and in 1955, Random House launched the Modern Library Paperbacks.</p>
<h3>Number of titles</h3>
<p>Eight titles were added and five were discontinued. This brought the number of available titles in the Modern Library to 298.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. The top edge was stained to match the inset panels on the spine and front cover.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>$1.25 (January–March); $1.45 (April–December). All new 1954 titles were published after the increase took effect.</p>
<h3>Dating keys</h3>
<p>(Spring) Byron, <em>Selected Poetry</em> xBrowning, <em>Selected Poetry</em>; Giants through G78 with G9 DeQuincey, <em>Selected Writings</em>; jackets: 370. (Fall) Browning, <em>Selected Poetry</em> xFaulkner, <em>Go Down, Moses</em>; Giants through G78 with G9 <em>Great Voices of the Reformation</em> and G56 Sterne, <em>Tristram Shandy &amp; A Sentimental Journey</em>; jackets: 371.</p>
<h3>Titles sought, suggested, declined</h3>
<p>The Modern Library sought reprint rights for Rachel Carson’s <em>The Sea Around Us</em> (Klopfer to Cerf, 2 February 1954). Cerf asked Harcourt, Brace for Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, but was informed that sales were too good for it to be let go (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 23 June 1954). William Collins and Sons contacted the ML about sharing the cost of translating the great Russian novelists for the ML and their Pocket Classics (William Collins to Klopfer, 9 July 1954), but nothing appears to have come of this. E. B. White wrote of a ML offer, “About the Bennett Cerf inquiry, I have no interest at the moment in collecting my ‘early work.’ Most of it is in collected form already, a lot of the rest of it isn’t worth collecting, and I’m not in a collecting mood, nor do I want a Modern Library man to start picking around in my spotty past” (E. B. White to Cass Canfield, 4 October 1954; <em>Letters of E. B. White</em>, p. 399).</p>
<p>Cerf received a suggestion to reprint his humor books as an ML Giant. He replied that he was flattered, “but quite honestly I’m not good enough” (Cerf to Ralph Winans, 22 July 1954).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> This book is one of the best accounts of the colorful period of Italian life and thought between 1350 and 1550. Here is a brilliant panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship between the individual and the forces around him. The combination makes this book one of the few great classics of history. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25 May 1954. <em>WR</em> 29 May 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–91.</p>
<p>Klopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition of <em>Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy</em>. Stein thought the idea was a good one and indicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo Holborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some required college sale and am quite confident that it will have a satisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October 1953). Holborn received $150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11 November 1953).</p>
<p>The ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the public domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf offered George Allen &amp; Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a courtesy fee of $500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any considerable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that will balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities but less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953). The ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen &amp; Unwin and includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C. Middlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged rendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by comparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig Goldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes and has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material preceded by asterisks” (p. [iv]).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Jacob Burckhardt’s essay, as he called it, was first published in 1860, and as Hajo Holborn writes in his introduction, “it has remained the greatest single book ever written on the history of Italy between 1350 and 1550. . . . It created methods of reviving the past which will have a lasting influence on the writing of history. Finally, it opened a deep view of the relationship between the human individual and the forces of history.” Rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners and thought of one of the most innovative eras in human history, this brilliant panorama of Renaissance life is also a thorough examination of the nature of civilization and of man’s place within it. Burckhardt’s encyclopedic knowledge, his mastery of style, and his genius for synthesis make this one of the few great classics of history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> The writer of some of the most beautiful lyric poems in English and a romantic, almost legendary figure in his own right, Lord Byron is known to many of us as both a creator and archetype of the melancholy, world-weary wanderer in literature to whom he unwittingly bequeathed his own name, the “Byronic hero.” Such is the figure revealed in the cantos of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>, while the selections in this volume from <em>Hebrew Melodies</em> and <em>Hours of Idleness</em> prove the poet’s great lyric gifts. But such additional works as <em>Beppo</em> and <em>The Vision of Judgment</em>, <em>English Bards</em> <em>and Scotch Reviewers</em> and the occasional verses penned for his friends show us a poet equally at home in ironic high comedy and biting satire, a poet capable of facing the world and human nature with unwavering realism. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ML collection. Published in MLCE 1951 and in the regular ML spring 1954. <em>WR</em> 10 April 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1973; retained in MLCE.</p>
<p>Marchand received a flat fee of $250 for writing the introduction and selecting the contents; $50 for preparing editorial head notes, which are printed within square brackets at the beginning of each section; and an additional $100 when the collection was published in the regular ML. Stein told him, “Since <em>Don Juan</em> is already available in the Modern Library, this means that we can include roughly half of Byron’s remaining poetical writings and a small selection of his prose if you feel any of it should be included” (Stein to Marchand, 27 June 1950).</p>
<p>The text was based on <em>The Works of Lord Byron</em>, edited by Ernest Hartley Coleridge (7 vols., London: John Murray; New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1898–1901).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> Samuel Hoffenstein practices in the tradition of sparkling light verse that has become one of the most refreshing trends on the American literary scene. And even in that tradition he is unique, as evidenced by the constantly increasing corps of Hoffenstein devotees. In this book, to their infinite joy and that of the hosts of newcomers who will join their ranks upon its publication, the Modern Library presents the complete Hoffenstein to date, the full texts of his three volumes—<em>Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing, Year In, You’re Out,</em> and <em>Pencil in the Air</em>. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing</em> originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright, 1928; <em>Year In, You’re Out</em> originally published by Horace Liveright, 1930; <em>Pencil in the Air</em> originally published by Doubleday &amp; Co., 1947. Original ML collection printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1954. <em>WR</em> 29 May 1954. First (and only) printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.</p>
<p>The ML paid a $2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. Rights to <em>Pencil in the Air</em> had reverted to Hoffenstein’s estate, and the advance was divided equally between Liveright and David Hoffenstein, the author’s son. The ML edition sold about 6,000 copies in four and a half years (David Hoffenstein to Cerf, 9 December 1958). When the ML edition was discontinued Cerf wrote to David Hoffenstein, “I am sorry to say that we cannot possibly keep the Hoffenstein Poetry in the Modern Library. Quite frankly, it was one of the very poorest sellers we have ever had in the series. I am just as sorry about this as I know you are” (Cerf to David Hoffenstein, 23 December 1958).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> All the elements for thoroughgoing entertainment can be found in this book. The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land remote geographically and in way of life from the western world. It is peopled with potentates and slave girls, robbers and rogues and—above all—a hero, a resourceful, tongue-in-cheek rascal named Hajji Baba. This adventurer’s ups and (mostly) downs take him through every employment from barber to executioner, into caravans, harems, and camps, and introduce him, and us, to every type of individual in the human comedy. We may suspect, as we pursue our hero from one crisis to another, that James Morier is using these tales to comment on the pride, affectation, hypocrisy and chicanery which are universal in human nature, but Hajji Baba himself asks only a relaxed and sympathetic listener for the varied episodes of his career.

Published spring 1954. <em>WR</em> 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1960.</p>
<p>Random House published an edition of <em>The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan</em> with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938 dividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it was printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s format.</p>
<p>Stein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an introduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of $200, but Haight was too busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953). He then approached Altick, offering him $150. He wrote, “What we have in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving largely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth reading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail, but there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a book published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide pleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first appeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his autobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition of James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, <em>The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan</em> . . . which, although it never came near to being one of the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints, earned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one of our daughters” (Altick, <em>A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an Adventurous Scholar,</em> p. 200).</p>
<p>Although Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three printings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and spring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume.</p>
<p>Several months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I have just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an advance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I all change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to Altick, 23 September 1954).</p>

<p>Front flap:<br> No poet in English literature excelled Robert Browning in the ability to understand the human heart and mind and soul. The tangled web of love and hate, hope and despair, faith and disbelief envelops the panorama of memorable characters in his poetry—lords, ladies, monks, alchemists, scholars, musicians, and others who crowd the colorful pages of his work. Throughout his writing there is an unbroken fortitude and an awareness of man’s capacity for greatness that provides inspiring guidance to all in a troubled time. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>

<p>The Bywater translation of <em>Poetics</em> was originally published by the Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1909; the Roberts translation of <em>Rhetoric</em> was originally published by the Clarendon Press (Oxford) in 1924. The ML paid Clarendon Press a $300 advance on the first 10,000 copies and royalties of 5 percent of the list price thereafter. Solmsen received a flat fee of $300 for his work on the ML edition. Stein found Solmsen’s English a bit clumsy and sent the introduction to Sidney Kaplan at the University of Massachusetts for stylistic improvement and clarification. Kaplan received $30 for this work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats, Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes them unmistakably Irish. (<em>Spring 1954</em>)</p>

<p>Original ML anthology. Publication announced for spring 1954 and postponed to fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 20 November 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.</p>
<p>Greene received a flat fee of $750 for his work on the anthology. The permissions budget was limited to $1,500, and the scope of the anthology was reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by Yeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted $25 per poem for American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate, wanted an additional $20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to $12.50 per poem, but this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the sales territory for <em>An Anthology of Irish Literature</em> to the U.S. and Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The representation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well.</p>
<p>Frank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s <em>The Midnight Court</em> for the anthology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Front flap:<br> Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved. (<em>Fall 1954</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A Curtain of Green</em> originally published with Porter introduction by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as <em>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</em> by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1947. <em>The Wide Net and Other Stories</em> originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. <em>WR</em> 16 October 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>Cerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt, Brace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager sent <em>A Curtain of Green</em>, <em>The Robber Bridegroom</em>, <em>The Wide Net</em>, <em>Delta Wedding</em>, and <em>The Golden Apples</em>, expressing the hope that the ML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The reprint contract for <em>Selected Stories of Eudora Welty</em> was signed a month later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk reports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (<em>Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work</em>, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete information about printings and sales is not available in the RH archives, but the following evidence is suggestive: <em>Selected Stories of Eudora Welty</em> does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than 2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and it sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500 titles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the titles that survived.</p>
<p>Textual variants between the first edition of <em>A Curtain of Green</em> (Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text of the Modern Library <em>A Curtain of Green</em>” (1979). Polk writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of <em>A Curtain of Green</em>. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of <em>A Curtain of Green</em> is two typesettings removed from the first American edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted the Harcourt, Brace text in its <em>Selected Stories</em> (NY, 1954), it of course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of <em>A Curtain of Green</em> is both the only one currently in print and the text most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the Harcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in print and the one most frequently cited.</p>

<p>Polk indicates that the ML edition went out of print in October 1977 after 27,035 copies had been printed and that it was brought back into print in 1978 (<em>Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work</em>, p. 94). It appears more likely that it went out of print in 1976 since 471c was published in fall 1977.</p>

Initially, Random House was attracted by the idea of obtaining rights for the Modern Library of a number of new translations commissioned for Penguin Classics, a distinguished and highly successful series that began in 1946. Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had been criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux’s 1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes’s *Don Quixote*; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *Iliad* and *Odyssey*; Constance Garnett’s translation of Chekhov’s *Plays*; and anonymous translations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had superior translations of these and other works. \n\nIn March 1954, Klopfer received a letter from Milton Waldman of the British publishing firm Rupert Hart-Davis, who wrote that Lane had expressed an interest in arranging for joint publication of various classics with the Modern Library (Milton Waldman to Klopfer, 31 March 1954). Jess Stein was given the job of examining the translations in Penguin Classics. He prepared a long memorandum for Klopfer in which he indicated which Penguin translations would be desirable for the Modern Library. However, nothing came of the negotiations with Lane and in 1955, Random House launched the Modern Library Paperbacks. \n\n### Number of titles \n\nEight titles were added and five were discontinued. This brought the number of available titles in the Modern Library to 298. \n\n### Format \n\nNew titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. The top edge was stained to match the inset panels on the spine and front cover. \n\n### Price \n\n\\$1.25 (January–March); \\$1.45 (April–December). All new 1954 titles were published after the increase took effect. \n\n### Dating keys \n\n(Spring) Byron, *Selected Poetry* xBrowning, *Selected Poetry*; Giants through G78 with G9 DeQuincey, *Selected Writings*; jackets: 370. (Fall) Browning, *Selected Poetry* xFaulkner, *Go Down, Moses*; Giants through G78 with G9 *Great Voices of the Reformation* and G56 Sterne, *Tristram Shandy & A Sentimental Journey*; jackets: 371. \n\n### Titles sought, suggested, declined \n\nThe Modern Library sought reprint rights for Rachel Carson’s *The Sea Around Us* (Klopfer to Cerf, 2 February 1954). Cerf asked Harcourt, Brace for Orwell’s *1984*, but was informed that sales were too good for it to be let go (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 23 June 1954). William Collins and Sons contacted the ML about sharing the cost of translating the great Russian novelists for the ML and their Pocket Classics (William Collins to Klopfer, 9 July 1954), but nothing appears to have come of this. E. B. White wrote of a ML offer, “About the Bennett Cerf inquiry, I have no interest at the moment in collecting my ‘early work.’ Most of it is in collected form already, a lot of the rest of it isn’t worth collecting, and I’m not in a collecting mood, nor do I want a Modern Library man to start picking around in my spotty past” (E. B. White to Cass Canfield, 4 October 1954; *Letters of E. B. White*, p. 399). \n\nCerf received a suggestion to reprint his humor books as an ML Giant. He replied that he was flattered, “but quite honestly I’m not good enough” (Cerf to Ralph Winans, 22 July 1954). \n\n### New titles \nBurckhardt, *Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy* (1954) 464 \nByron, *Selected Poetry of Lord Byron* (1954) 465 \nHoffenstein, *Complete Poetry* (1954) 466 \nMorier, *Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* (1954) 467 \nBrowning, *Selected Poetry of Robert Browning* (1954) 468 \nAristotle, *Rhetoric; Politics* (1954) 469 \nGreene, ed., Anthology of Irish Literature (1954) 470 \nWelty, *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* (1954) 471\n\n### Discontinued \nMcDermott, ed., *Sex Problem in Modern Society* (1931) \nMcFee, *Casuals of the Sea* (1931) \nPaul, *Life and Death of a Spanish Town* (1942) \nRawlings, *The Yearling* (1946) \nSheean, *Personal History* (1940) \n\n#### ***Spring*** \n\n### 464 \n\n**JACOB BURCKHARDT.

Here is a brilliant panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship between the individual and the forces around him. The combination makes this book one of the few great classics of history. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25 May 1954. *WR* 29 May 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–91. \n\nKlopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition of *Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy*. Stein thought the idea was a good one and indicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo Holborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some required college sale and am quite confident that it will have a satisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October 1953). Holborn received \\$150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11 November 1953). \n\nThe ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the public domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf offered George Allen & Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a courtesy fee of \\$500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any considerable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that will balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities but less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953). The ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen & Unwin and includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C. Middlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged rendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by comparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig Goldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes and has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material preceded by asterisks” (p.

It created methods of reviving the past which will have a lasting influence on the writing of history. Finally, it opened a deep view of the relationship between the human individual and the forces of history.” Rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners and thought of one of the most innovative eras in human history, this brilliant panorama of Renaissance life is also a thorough examination of the nature of civilization and of man’s place within it. Burckhardt’s encyclopedic knowledge, his mastery of style, and his genius for synthesis make this one of the few great classics of history. \n\nPrinted from offset plates photographically reproduced from 464a.

But such additional works as *Beppo* and *The Vision of Judgment*, *English Bards* *and Scotch Reviewers* and the occasional verses penned for his friends show us a poet equally at home in ironic high comedy and biting satire, a poet capable of facing the world and human nature with unwavering realism.

Rights to *Pencil in the Air* had reverted to Hoffenstein’s estate, and the advance was divided equally between Liveright and David Hoffenstein, the author’s son. The ML edition sold about 6,000 copies in four and a half years (David Hoffenstein to Cerf, 9 December 1958). When the ML edition was discontinued Cerf wrote to David Hoffenstein, “I am sorry to say that we cannot possibly keep the Hoffenstein Poetry in the Modern Library. Quite frankly, it was one of the very poorest sellers we have ever had in the series. I am just as sorry about this as I know you are” (Cerf to David Hoffenstein, 23 December 1958). \n\n### 467 \n\n**JAMES MORIER. THE ADVENTURES OF HAJJI BABA OF ISPAHAN. 1954–1959.

Signed: F.K. [Fritz Kredel] \n\n> Front flap:<br> All the elements for thoroughgoing entertainment can be found in this book. The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land remote geographically and in way of life from the western world. It is peopled with potentates and slave girls, robbers and rogues and—above all—a hero, a resourceful, tongue-in-cheek rascal named Hajji Baba. This adventurer’s ups and (mostly) downs take him through every employment from barber to executioner, into caravans, harems, and camps, and introduce him, and us, to every type of individual in the human comedy. We may suspect, as we pursue our hero from one crisis to another, that James Morier is using these tales to comment on the pride, affectation, hypocrisy and chicanery which are universal in human nature, but Hajji Baba himself asks only a relaxed and sympathetic listener for the varied episodes of his career. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nOriginally published 1824. ML edition (pp. [xi]–456) printed from plates of the Cresset Press edition (or a duplicate set of the Cresset plates) published in London, 1949, with the introduction by Richard Jennings and the bibliography omitted, Altick’s introduction added, roman page numerals removed from table of contents, alphabetical signatures removed from text pages (except p. 3, where “A.H.B.” [*Adventures of Hajji Baba*] appears at the left of the bottom margin and the signature “C” appears at the right), and initials “P. P.” removed from p. 456 following the end of the text. Published spring 1954. *WR* 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1960. \n\nRandom House published an edition of *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938 dividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it was printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s format. \n\nStein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an introduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of \\$200, but Haight was too busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953). He then approached Altick, offering him \\$150. He wrote, “What we have in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving largely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth reading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail, but there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a book published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide pleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first appeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his autobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition of James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* . . . which, although it never came near to being one of the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints, earned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one of our daughters” (Altick, *A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an Adventurous Scholar,* p. 200). \n\nAlthough Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three printings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and spring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume. \n\nSeveral months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I have just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an advance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I all change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to Altick, 23 September 1954). \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n### 468 \n\n**ROBERT BROWNING.

It has long been the hope of the editors of the Modern Library to include these works in complete form, and now permission to use the distinguished Oxford translations by Roberts and Bywater makes this book possible. To it, Professor Solmsen has contributed a distinguished introduction and a body of helpful notes. (*Fall 1954*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting.

Beginning with the first traces of Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats, Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes them unmistakably Irish.

Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nGreene received a flat fee of \\$750 for his work on the anthology. The permissions budget was limited to \\$1,500, and the scope of the anthology was reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by Yeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted \\$25 per poem for American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate, wanted an additional \\$20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to \\$12.50 per poem, but this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the sales territory for *An Anthology of Irish Literature* to the U.S. and Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The representation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well. \n\nFrank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s *The Midnight Court* for the anthology. \n\n#### 470b.

Signed: PG [Paul Galdone]. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved. (*Fall 1954*) \n\n*A Curtain of Green* originally published with Porter introduction by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as *A Curtain of Green and Other Stories* by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947. *The Wide Net and Other Stories* originally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. \n\nCerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt, Brace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager sent *A Curtain of Green*, *The Robber Bridegroom*, *The Wide Net*, *Delta Wedding*, and *The Golden Apples*, expressing the hope that the ML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The reprint contract for *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* was signed a month later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk reports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (*Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work*, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete information about printings and sales is not available in the RH archives, but the following evidence is suggestive: *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than 2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and it sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500 titles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the titles that survived. \n\nTextual variants between the first edition of *A Curtain of Green* (Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text of the Modern Library *A Curtain of Green*” (1979). Polk writes: \n\n> In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of *A Curtain of Green*. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of *A Curtain of Green* is two typesettings removed from the first American edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted the Harcourt, Brace text in its *Selected Stories* (NY, 1954), it of course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of *A Curtain of Green* is both the only one currently in print and the text most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6) \n\nIn his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the Harcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in print and the one most frequently cited. \n\n#### 471b.

Here is a brilliant panorama of Renaissance life—rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners, and thought of the time—sparkling and vigorous in the spirit of the new modern age. But if Jacob Burckhardt knew well how to convey the color of the period, he was also able to give generations of readers more profound insights into the relationship between the individual and the forces around him. The combination makes this book one of the few great classics of history. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published 25 May 1954. *WR* 29 May 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1971/72. Reissued 1980–91. \n\nKlopfer appears to have suggested a ML edition of *Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy*. Stein thought the idea was a good one and indicated that it should have an introduction by someone like Hajo Holborn. He told Klopfer, “I expect that the book would have some required college sale and am quite confident that it will have a satisfactory trade sale as well” (Stein memo to Klopfer, 21 October 1953). Holborn received \\$150 for the introduction (Stein to Holborn, 11 November 1953). \n\nThe ML used the translation of S. G. C. Middlemore which was in the public domain in the United States but copyrighted in Britain. Cerf offered George Allen & Unwin, publishers of the British edition, a courtesy fee of \\$500. “Frankly,” he wrote, “we do not foresee any considerable sale for this work, but it is the kind of solid title that will balance some other items that have greater commercial possibilities but less solid literary value” (Cerf to Stanley Unwin, 22 October 1953). The ML edition was published by arrangement with George Allen & Unwin and includes the following textual note: “This translation by S. G. C. Middlemore was published in 1878 and is a complete and unabridged rendering of the second original edition. Minor errors shown by comparison with the first edition have been corrected by Ludwig Goldscheider, who has also made the selection from Burckhardt’s notes and has added to them the explanatory and bibliographical material preceded by asterisks” (p.

It created methods of reviving the past which will have a lasting influence on the writing of history. Finally, it opened a deep view of the relationship between the human individual and the forces of history.” Rich in its detailed account of the arts, fashions, manners and thought of one of the most innovative eras in human history, this brilliant panorama of Renaissance life is also a thorough examination of the nature of civilization and of man’s place within it.

But such additional works as *Beppo* and *The Vision of Judgment*, *English Bards* *and Scotch Reviewers* and the occasional verses penned for his friends show us a poet equally at home in ironic high comedy and biting satire, a poet capable of facing the world and human nature with unwavering realism.

Rights to *Pencil in the Air* had reverted to Hoffenstein’s estate, and the advance was divided equally between Liveright and David Hoffenstein, the author’s son. The ML edition sold about 6,000 copies in four and a half years (David Hoffenstein to Cerf, 9 December 1958). When the ML edition was discontinued Cerf wrote to David Hoffenstein, “I am sorry to say that we cannot possibly keep the Hoffenstein Poetry in the Modern Library. Quite frankly, it was one of the very poorest sellers we have ever had in the series. I am just as sorry about this as I know you are” (Cerf to David Hoffenstein, 23 December 1958). \n\n"

Signed: F.K. [Fritz Kredel] \n\n> Front flap:<br> All the elements for thoroughgoing entertainment can be found in this book. The story is laid in nineteenth-century Persia, a romantic land remote geographically and in way of life from the western world. It is peopled with potentates and slave girls, robbers and rogues and—above all—a hero, a resourceful, tongue-in-cheek rascal named Hajji Baba. This adventurer’s ups and (mostly) downs take him through every employment from barber to executioner, into caravans, harems, and camps, and introduce him, and us, to every type of individual in the human comedy. We may suspect, as we pursue our hero from one crisis to another, that James Morier is using these tales to comment on the pride, affectation, hypocrisy and chicanery which are universal in human nature, but Hajji Baba himself asks only a relaxed and sympathetic listener for the varied episodes of his career. (*Spring 1954*) \n\nOriginally published 1824. ML edition (pp. [xi]–456) printed from plates of the Cresset Press edition (or a duplicate set of the Cresset plates) published in London, 1949, with the introduction by Richard Jennings and the bibliography omitted, Altick’s introduction added, roman page numerals removed from table of contents, alphabetical signatures removed from text pages (except p. 3, where “A.H.B.” [*Adventures of Hajji Baba*] appears at the left of the bottom margin and the signature “C” appears at the right), and initials “P. P.” removed from p. 456 following the end of the text. Published spring 1954. *WR* 10 April 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1960. \n\nRandom House published an edition of *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* with color and black-and-white illustrations by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge which was used by the Book-of-the-Month Club as a 1938 dividend. The plates of the 10¾ x 7½ inch (270 x 187 mm) volume—if it was printed from plates—would have been far too large for the ML’s format. \n\nStein initially asked Gordon S. Haight of Yale University to write an introduction to the ML edition and offered a fee of \\$200, but Haight was too busy (Stein to Haight, 20 October 1953; Haight to Stein, 5 November 1953). He then approached Altick, offering him \\$150. He wrote, “What we have in mind is an introduction running about 2000 words and serving largely to reassure the timorous reader that this is a book worth reading. We do not want to load the introduction with too much detail, but there should be enough to let the reader know that though this is a book published more than one hundred years ago, it continues to provide pleasurable reading as widely, if not more so, as it did when it first appeared” (Stein to Altick, 9 November 1953). Altick comments in his autobiography, “I wrote the introduction to the Modern Library edition of James Morier’s pseudo-Oriental confection, *The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan* . . . which, although it never came near to being one of the best-selling titles in that long, influential series of reprints, earned me a fee that, almost to the dollar, paid for the arrival of one of our daughters” (Altick, *A Little Bit of Luck: The Making of an Adventurous Scholar,* p. 200). \n\nAlthough Morier’s book remained in the ML for less than six years, three printings have been identified, including printings with spring 1955 and spring 1958 ML lists at the end of the volume. \n\nSeveral months after the ML edition was published Stein wrote Altick, “I have just come from the Twentieth Century Fox office where they held an advance showing of HAJJI BABA. I suggest that you, James Morier, and I all change our names and try to start life anew in Venezuela” (Stein to Altick, 23 September 1954). \n\n#### ***Fall*** \n\n"

Signed: RIKI. \n\n> Front flap:<br> This book spans more than twelve centuries of writing to present the rich heritage of Irish literature. Beginning with the first traces of Celtic literature written in the margins of medieval manuscripts by scribes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it continues through the great cycles of mythology and romance whose heroes’ names are poetry themselves—Cuchulain, who fought with the sea, Mad Sweeney, and Deirdre of the Sorrows. There are tales and poems that celebrate the love of freedom and reckless heroism of Irish patriots, and there are quiet stories of the hedge schoolmasters, the gentry, and the people of the Irish countryside. Finally come the modern writers—Yeats, Joyce, Shaw, Synge, O’Casey, Gogarty, O’Connor and many others—who write in English but whose deep consciousness of the Celtic past makes them unmistakably Irish.

Discontinued 1970/71. \n\nGreene received a flat fee of \\$750 for his work on the anthology. The permissions budget was limited to \\$1,500, and the scope of the anthology was reduced as a result. Greene wanted to include twenty-one poems by Yeats, but Macmillan, Yeats’s American publisher, wanted \\$25 per poem for American rights and A. P. Watt, the agent for the Yeats estate, wanted an additional \\$20 per poem for world rights. The number of Yeats poems was cut to eleven and Watt reduced its fee to \\$12.50 per poem, but this was still too much for the budget. In the end the ML limited the sales territory for *An Anthology of Irish Literature* to the U.S. and Canada, and the number of Yeats poems was cut to nine. The representation of other authors in the anthology was reduced as well. \n\nFrank O’Connor revised his translation of Brian Merriman’s *The Midnight Court* for the anthology. \n\n#### 470b.

(*Late 1950s/early 1960s*) \n\n*Jacket:* Pictorial in strong greenish yellow (99), dark grayish blue (187) and black on coated white paper with oval illustration of the columned porch of a house, gnarled trees hanging with Spanish moss, and a low moon, surrounded by a strong greenish yellow glow and scattered stars; lettering in dark grayish blue and black. Signed: PG [Paul Galdone]. \n\n> Front flap:<br> Any one of the stories in this volume, by itself, would identify Eudora Welty as one of the most unusual short-story writers of our times. But only from the succession of story upon story, with startling variations of pace, style, and mood, comes a truer appreciation of the power and versatility of the artist. The twenty-five stories in this volume may range from the quietly understated narrative of “A Worn Path” to the breezily vulgar dialogue of “Petrified Man” or the thematic counterpoint of “Powerhouse,” but they all alike express their author’s talent and perception. The basic material of Miss Welty’s stories is her observation of human experience in her native South, but with great technical skill and psychological subtlety she succeeds not only in recreating that experience but in measuring its impact on the persons involved. (*Fall 1954*) \n\n*A Curtain of Green* originally published with Porter introduction by Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1941; new bibliographical edition published as *A Curtain of Green and Other Stories* by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1947. *The Wide Net and Other Stories* originally published by Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1943. ML edition (pp. xi–xxiii, 3–289; 3–214) printed from Harcourt, Brace plates. Published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First printing: 5,000 copies. \n\nCerf was interested in adding Welty to the ML and telephoned Harcourt, Brace to request copies of her books. The Harcourt, Brace sales manager sent *A Curtain of Green*, *The Robber Bridegroom*, *The Wide Net*, *Delta Wedding*, and *The Golden Apples*, expressing the hope that the ML would take one of them (Edward A. Hodge to Cerf, 14 May 1953). The reprint contract for *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* was signed a month later. The ML paid Harcourt, Brace royalties of 10 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1955. Noel Polk reports that 27,035 copies were printed by October 1977 (*Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work*, p. 94), but this figure seems low. Complete information about printings and sales is not available in the RH archives, but the following evidence is suggestive: *Selected Stories of Eudora Welty* does not appear on lists of titles selling fewer than 2,000 copies a year that the ML began to maintain in the late 1960s, and it sold 2,400 copies in 1970. When the ML cut its list from nearly 500 titles in 1970 to fewer than 140 in the mid-1970s, it was one of the titles that survived. \n\nTextual variants between the first edition of *A Curtain of Green* (Doubleday, Doran, 1941) and the ML text have been noted by Polk, “Text of the Modern Library *A Curtain of Green*” (1979). Polk writes: \n\n> In 1946 Harcourt, Brace proposed to publish a new edition of *A Curtain of Green*. Miss Welty was asked whether she had any revisions or corrections to make in the text, and then was asked to supply a copy of the book to send to the printer. To the first request Miss Welty replied that she had no revisions to make; to the second she responded by sending a copy not of the first American edition (NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1941) but of the first English edition (London: John Lane the Bodley Head, 1943). Thus the Harcourt, Brace text of *A Curtain of Green* is two typesettings removed from the first American edition, and since it is fairly clear that Miss Welty had no hand in any but the Doubleday, Doran edition, the many textual differences between the first edition and the Harcourt, Brace edition must be considered corruptions of the text. When the Modern Library reprinted the Harcourt, Brace text in its *Selected Stories* (NY, 1954), it of course perpetuated those corruptions. This is a fact of some importance to Welty scholarship, since the Modern Library text of *A Curtain of Green* is both the only one currently in print and the text most frequently cited by critics. (p. 6) \n\nIn his writings Polk tended to refer to the ML text rather than the Harcourt, Brace text because it was for many years the only edition in print and the one most frequently cited. \n\n#### 471b.

It appears more likely that it went out of print in 1976 since 471c was published in fall 1977. "

  "searchContent": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1954 1954 In 1954, Random House entered into negotiations with Allen Lane, the founder and head of Penguin Books in England, to explore the possibility of Random House’s acquiring the American branch of the firm. Initially, Random House was attracted by the idea of obtaining rights for the Modern Library of a number of new translations commissioned for Penguin Classics, a distinguished and highly successful series that began in 1946. Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had been criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux’s 1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes’s *Don Quixote*; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *Iliad* and *Odyssey*; Constance Garnett’s translation of Chekhov’s *Plays*; and anonymous translations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had superior translations of these and other works. \n\nIn March 1954, Klopfer received a letter from Milton Waldman of the British publishing firm Rupert Hart-Davis, who wrote that Lane had expressed an interest in arranging for joint publication of various classics with the Modern Library (Milton Waldman to Klopfer, 31 March 1954). Jess Stein was given the job of examining the translations in Penguin Classics. He prepared a long memorandum for Klopfer in which he indicated which Penguin translations would be desirable for the Modern Library. However, nothing came of the negotiations with Lane and in 1955, Random House launched the Modern Library Paperbacks. Eight titles were added and five were discontinued. This brought the number of available titles in the Modern Library to 298. New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. The top edge was stained to match the inset panels on the spine and front cover. \\$1.25 (January–March); \\$1.45 (April–December). All new 1954 titles were published after the increase took effect. (Spring) Byron, *Selected Poetry* xBrowning, *Selected Poetry*; Giants through G78 with G9 DeQuincey, *Selected Writings*; jackets: 370. (Fall) Browning, *Selected Poetry* xFaulkner, *Go Down, Moses*; Giants through G78 with G9 *Great Voices of the Reformation* and G56 Sterne, *Tristram Shandy & A Sentimental Journey*; jackets: 371. The Modern Library sought reprint rights for Rachel Carson’s *The Sea Around Us* (Klopfer to Cerf, 2 February 1954). Cerf asked Harcourt, Brace for Orwell’s *1984*, but was informed that sales were too good for it to be let go (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 23 June 1954). William Collins and Sons contacted the ML about sharing the cost of translating the great Russian novelists for the ML and their Pocket Classics (William Collins to Klopfer, 9 July 1954), but nothing appears to have come of this. E. B. White wrote of a ML offer, “About the Bennett Cerf inquiry, I have no interest at the moment in collecting my ‘early work.’ Most of it is in collected form already, a lot of the rest of it isn’t worth collecting, and I’m not in a collecting mood, nor do I want a Modern Library man to start picking around in my spotty past” (E. B. White to Cass Canfield, 4 October 1954; *Letters of E. B. White*, p. 399). \n\nCerf received a suggestion to reprint his humor books as an ML Giant. He replied that he was flattered, “but quite honestly I’m not good enough” (Cerf to Ralph Winans, 22 July 1954).
