The book appeared under the Random House imprint, but the U.S. copyright was registered under The Modern Library, Inc., which at this point was still the legal name of the firm. Before 1934 many American visitors to Paris brought back copies of the original edition published in 1922 by Shakespeare and Company, the Paris bookshop established by the American expatriate Sylvia Beach. *Ulysses* was officially banned in the United States and tourists returning to the U.S. ran the risk of having it confiscated at customs.  \r\n\r\n Cerf and Klopfer wanted to establish the legal right to publish and sell *Ulysses* before they printed their edition. They arranged for a copy of the Shakespeare and Company edition with critical evaluations of the work bound in—thus assuring their admissibility as evidence in court—to be seized at customs. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, with Judge John M. Woolsey presiding and attorneys Morris L. Ernst and Alexander Lindey representing Random House. Judge Woolsey’s decision, rendered 6 December 1933, recognized the literary stature of *Ulysses* and concluded that “nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.” The prohibition against its importation into the United States was overturned.  \r\n\r\n The Random House edition, including Judge Woolsey’s decision, a foreword by Morris Ernst, and a letter from Joyce, was published in January at \\$3.50. Joyce received royalties of 20 percent of the list price. The RH edition sold nearly 50,000 copies by June 1939, giving Joyce well over \\$30,000 (Cerf to Dashiell Hammett, 7 June 1939). *Ulysses* (G50) was added to ML Giants in 1940.  \r\n\r\n Other trade books published in 1934 under the Random House imprint included a four-volume edition of Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, Gertrude Stein’s *Four Saints in Three Acts*, volumes of poetry by W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play *Merrily We Roll Along*, and William Saroyan’s *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze*. [object Object]",

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1939 1939 The ML underwent a major change in format and design for the second time in its history. The first, in 1929, substituted balloon cloth bindings for imitation leather and introduced Rockwell Kent’s binding and endpaper designs. (Balloon cloth began to be used in January 1929; Kent’s binding and endpaper designs were introduced in April.) The balloon cloth format suffered from two problems. The semi-flexible balloon cloth bindings were attractive but did not stand up to heavy use. And the 6½ x 4¼ inch (165 x 107 mm) page size, retained from Boni & Liveright days, sometimes made it difficult to print from original publishers’ letterpress plates, most of which were designed for a larger format. Many of the volumes printed from original publishers’ plates had uncomfortably narrow margins. Sometimes the original plates were too large to be used by the ML.  \r\n\r\nThe ML’s economic model assumed multiple printings, and all ML books were printed from plates. For older titles in the public domain the ML usually ordered new typesettings from which new plates were made. Copyrighted works were printed whenever possible from the original publisher’s plates. In general, the ML expected to pay royalties or typesetting and plate-making costs but tried whenever possible to avoid paying both. Royalties paid by the ML to the original publisher were regarded in part as a plate rental. In this respect the ML operated no differently than Grosset & Dunlap and other publishers of hardbound reprints of current books. Grosset & Dunlap differed from the ML in that its printings were closer in size to the original publishers’ editions, and it rarely had problems using original publishers’ plates.  \r\n\r\nThe ML had several options when the original publisher’s plates were too large for its format. The most expensive option was to reset the work to fit its format and make new letterpress plates. When the ML did this for copyrighted titles the original publisher occasionally agreed to forego royalties in whole or part until the plates were paid for. A second option was to photograph a clean copy of the original publisher’s edition, reduce the size of the type page photographically, and print by offset lithography. The disadvantage of this approach was that before the 1960s offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress printing and the quality was inferior. Another option when the original publisher’s plates were only slightly too large for the ML’s format was to print from a duplicate set of plates with the headline removed. Finally, the ML could print a given title in a slightly larger format in order to accommodate the original publisher’s plates. The ML resorted to this option on several occasions during the balloon cloth era, and once—for Charles Jackson’s *The* *Lost Weekend* (406), a short-lived title published in 1948—after the introduction of its larger format in fall 1939.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem with the balloon cloth format was that it made it harder to sell ML books to libraries. Many libraries did not buy ML books before the 1940s because the bindings did not stand up to heavy use and the narrow margins made rebinding difficult.  \r\n\r\nA new format that corrected both faults was introduced in September 1939 with *Six Plays of Clifford Odets* (321) and John Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle* (322). The page size was increased half an inch to 7 x 4¾ inches (176 x 120 mm). And the balloon cloth binding was replaced with a far more durable binding constructed of stiff boards covered with smooth linen. The new binding, designed by Joseph Blumenthal, is described below. Two spring 1939 titles, Irving Stone, *Lust for Life* (317) and Isak Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales* (320), were published in the larger format with balloon cloth bindings.  \r\n\r\nThe introduction of the larger format for regular ML volumes meant that existing jackets had to be replaced or redesigned. A few titles received enlarged versions of their existing jackets, but most were outfitted in newly designed jackets. Two designers were responsible for most of the new jackets that were introduced at this period. Joseph Blumenthal created a large number of elegant typographic jackets. The majority of new pictorial jackets were by Paul Galdone, a Hungarian-born illustrator of children’s books who designed his first ML jackets in 1937. Many ML Giants also received new jackets to go with their new bindings, although the size of the Giants remained unchanged.  \r\n\r\nThe introduction of the new format involved reprinting backlist titles at an accelerated pace so the series could regain a uniform appearance as quickly as possible. It also presented the ML with the problem of disposing of balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse. When the first two titles in new format were published in September 1939, over 200 regular ML titles remained in the balloon cloth format. It would be February 1941 before the ML could announce, “Every title in the MODERN LIBRARY (95¢) is now ready *in the new binding!*” (*PW* 139, 15 February 1941, pp. 814–15).  \r\n\r\nAn arrangement with the Book-of-the-Month Club, which appears to have begun in fall 1938, may have been conceived in part as a way of reducing the inventory of balloon cloth titles. The Book-of-the-Month Club offered free Modern Library books, all in balloon cloth bindings and 1930s jackets, to members who made advance deposits of \\$12 or more against future purchases. Two 16-page brochures titled “Free Books” are known to exist. The first is undated, gives the Book-of-the-Month Club’s address as 386 Fourth Avenue, New York, and includes Fitzgerald’s *The Great* *Gatsby*—now one of the most sought-after ML titles (*MLC* 46, p. 1). The second catalog, dated 3-39 (March 1939), uses the Club’s new address, 385 Madison Avenue. The March 1939 catalog can be viewed online at <http://www.modernlib.com/General/brochures/BOMC/BOMC39.html> (accessed 24 August 2017). It lists 103 titles from the regular ML and 42 Giants—half of the titles then in the series—along with books from five other reprint series. *The Great Gatsby*, which had been discontinued at the end of 1938, is not included in the second catalog, although a large number of unsold copies remained in the ML warehouse. Any hint that the offer was essentially a remaindering operation was avoided. Book-of-the-Month Club members were also given the option of buying ML books at the regular price. The arrangement with the Book-of-the-Month Club suggests that the ML planned the transition to the new format well in advance.  \r\n\r\nMost of the 110,000 balloon cloth volumes that remained in the warehouse in early 1941 were disposed of at a widely publicized sale at Macy’s, the New York department store. Macy’s was one of the leading retailers of ML books, and it made a cash offer for the remaining stock of balloon cloth bindings. The sale was announced in a full-page ad in the Sunday *New York Times* (2 February 1941, p. 27). The ad listed 166 titles that were available in quantities of 100 copies or more. Another 50 balloon cloth titles were available in smaller quantities. The sale price for books in the discontinued binding was 33 cents. Three books were 94 cents; the price for twenty was \\$5.98. The sale began Monday morning at 9:30, and the books sold out in less than a week.  \r\n\r\nOnce the transition to the new format was complete, the ML invited booksellers to return their remaining stock of balloon cloth titles for replacement with volumes in the new format. Booksellers had a one-month window during which balloon cloth volumes could be exchanged. By February 1941, 700 accounts had returned around 160,000 books and received an equal number of volumes in the Blumenthal format at no cost. Two months later Cerf indicated that returns of balloon cloth volumes were expected to run to more than 200,000 copies. At that time the ML had not decided what would be done with the returned books, but the U.S. Government was expected to buy thousands of them for libraries in cantonments where new troops were billeted (*PW* 139, 8 February 1941, p. 741; 15 February 1941, pp. 814–15; 5 April 1941, p. 1459).  \r\n\r\nThe year that saw the introduction of the ML’s new format was also the year that the twentieth-century paperback revolution spread to the United States. The paperback revolution in the English-speaking world was launched by Allan Lane, who founded Penguin Books in 1935. Pocket Books, Inc., established in 1939, was the first American publisher of mass-market paperbacks. It operated very differently from the ML. The 6½ x 4⅛ inch (164 x 105 mm) format of mass-market paperbacks was smaller than the ML’s original format. Pocket Books ordered new typesettings for all of its titles, printed its books on high-speed magazine presses in print runs vastly larger than the ML’s, and priced the books at 25 cents. Magazine wholesalers, who distributed the books to mass-market outlets such as drug stores and newsstands, treated paperback books as they did magazines. Newly published titles were distributed monthly. Credit for unsold copies of the previous month’s books was secured by tearing off the front covers and returning the covers. The coverless books were then pulped. Eight new titles were added to the Modern Library and nine were discontinued, reducing the number of titles in the regular series to 218. Six new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1939 ML Giants included forty-six titles in forty-eight volumes. Two spring titles (Liddell Hart, *The War in Outline* and Walton, *The Compleat Angler*) were published in the ML’s standard balloon cloth format with binding D measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). The other two spring titles (Stone, *Lust for Life* and Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*) were in a larger format with balloon cloth bindings measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm).  \r\n\r\nFall titles were published in a newly designed binding with stiff boards measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). The larger format remained standard for nearly all titles published in the regular ML from fall 1939 through 1968. In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  \r\n\r\nMost books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages). All new titles in the regular ML had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; three had torchbearer C2 and five had torchbearer A2. All new titles had the 2-line imprint:  \r\n\r\n<center> T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y  </center>\r\n<center> NEW YORK  </center>\r\n\r\nAdler’s title-page design was used for the last time in fall 1939. Beginning in 1940 Modern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal. The balloon cloth binding was used for the last time in spring 1939. A new binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal, proprietor of the Spiral Press, was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. Blumenthal’s binding was designed for the ML’s new 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format and used smooth linen over stiff boards. The new bindings were in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover over upon which lettering stamped in gold. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Unlike balloon cloth bindings, where a portion of each printing of a given title was bound in cloth of different colors, each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. Successive printings sometimes had bindings in different color combinations. As Blumenthal recalled it, Cerf and Klopfer accepted the design on the first sketch he submitted (Blumenthal to GBN, 30 June 1978).  \r\n\r\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the inset panel on the spine. There were two versions of the inset panel on the front cover, both of which employed a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel. The first version of the outer frame, used on the two titles published in September 1939 and all titles published 1940–1962, featured Kent’s torchbearer in gold below the inset panel at the lower right.  \r\n\r\nBlumenthal appears to have been dissatisfied with the front panel design, and the two October 1939 titles, Fielding, *Joseph Andrews* (323) and Fineman, *Hear, Ye Sons* (324), feature an alternative version. The panel with the title and author is unchanged, but Kent’s torchbearer was omitted, and the outer frame in gold is adjusted so that the top is the same distance (10 mm) from the inner panel as the sides, and the bottom is 12 mm from the inner panel. The omission of the torchbearer gave the front panel of the binding a more classic, uncluttered appearance—but there was nothing on the front panel to identify the series or associate the volume with the ML. All previous ML bindings had included a ML device on the front panel. It is not known whether Blumenthal or Cerf and Klopfer made the decision to revert to Blumenthal’s original front panel design. All subsequent ML books except the first three Giants and titles in the short-lived Illustrated Modern Library series have included a ML device on the front panel of the binding. Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in moderate orange was used for one 1939 title, the first printing of Walton, *Complete Angler* (319). The only other 1939 title in the 6⅝ x 4⅜ inch format for which the endpaper had been designed was Liddell Hart, *War in Outline* (318), which used a map from the original edition as the front and back endpaper. The other two spring 1939 titles, Stone, *Lust for Life* and Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*, were published in the larger 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format that would be adopted for all ML titles in fall 1939. The first printings of *Lust for Life* and *Seven Gothic Tales* had plain cream endpapers, as did the four titles published in fall 1939. The only previous ML volume in the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, John Reed’s *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935), also had plain cream endpapers. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Four titles (Stone, *Lust for Life*; Liddell Hart, *War in Outline*; Walton, *Compleat Angler*; and Steinbeck, *In Dubious Battle*) had pictorial jackets, and four (Dinesen, *Seven Gothic Tales*; Odets, *Six Plays*; Fielding, *Joseph Andrews*; and Fineman, *Hear, Ye Sons*) had non-pictorial jackets. The jackets for *Joseph Andrews* and *Hear, Ye Sons* may have been designed by Joseph Blumenthal, whose newly designed binding was introduced in fall 1939 and whose individually designed title pages began to be used in 1940. Blumenthal created a large number of non-pictorial jackets for the ML during the 1940s, including many older titles that required new jackets when they were reprinted in the ML’s larger format. None of Blumenthal’s jackets were signed. 95 cents. (Spring) Stone, *Lust for Life* xOdets, *Six Plays*; Giants through G45; jackets: 265. (Fall) Odets, *Six Plays* xChaucer, *Troilus and Cressida*; Giants through G48; jackets: 268. Cerf asked Knopf for permission to publish Thomas Mann’s *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant, adding “we would be willing to make a special royalty deal on this one book, and would pay a whopping advance for it immediately” (Cerf to Knopf, 7 February 1939). Mann’s novel had appeared in the regular ML in 1932, but Knopf declined to renew the five-year reprint contract and the ML edition had been out of print since May 1938. Knopf rejected Cerf’s offer. Several subsequent reprint offers by the ML were also unsuccessful. *The Magic Mountain* was not restored to the regular ML until 1992, after Random House’s “relaunch” of the series. By this time Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., had been a division of Random House for 32 years.  \r\n\r\nCerf inquired about the possibility of doing a volume by Edna St. Vincent Millay in the ML (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 27 February 1939). Macmillan rejected an offer for the one-volume edition of Sir James George Frazier’s *The Golden Bough*, originally published in 1922, noting that it still netted the firm between \\$1,300 and \\$1,800 a year (George P. Brett, Macmillan, to Cerf, 7 August 1939). Cerf expressed interest in reprinting John Galsworthy’s *The Forsyte Saga* (published in one volume by Scribner’s in 1925) as a Giant, offering an advance of \\$7,500 (Cerf to Perkins, 26 September 1939), but Scribner’s had no interest in authorizing a reprint edition.  \r\n\r\nCerf also expressed interest in including A. L. Morton, *A People’s History of England* in ML Giants (Cerf to Morton, 9 November 1939), but the book never appeared in the series. The American edition had been published by Random House the previous year. The original edition was published in Britain by Victor Gollancz and had been the May 1938 main selection of Gollancz’s Left Book Club.  \r\n\r\nClifford Odets suggested a collection of the best eight, ten, or twelve American plays ever written (Odets to Cerf, 20 September 1939). Howard Mumford Jones suggested a volume by Anthony Trollope (Jones to Cerf, 8 June 1938), but the ML had published *The Warden & Barchester Towers* (292) three years earlier. It would be eight years before Trollope’s *Eustace Diamonds* (399) was added. John Farrar suggested Henry Seidel Canby’s *Age of Confidence*, which Farrar & Rinehart had published five years earlier.  \r\n\r\nCerf considered adding Gustavus Myers’s *History of the Supreme Court of the United States* but decided that it did not quite fit into the Modern Library list (Cerf to Kerr & Co., 7 November 1939).  \r\n\r\nGertrude Stein urged Cerf to add her two autobiographical works, *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* (Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1933) and *Everybody’s Autobiography* (Random House, 1937) to the ML (Stein to Cerf, undated). Cerf replied that he would love to see them as a Giant but that “public demand for these books is practically non-existent” (Cerf to Stein, 8 August 1939). Stein’s *Three Lives* (261) had been published in the ML in 1933, but sales were disappointing and it was discontinued at the end of 1940. It would be twenty-four years before another book by Stein appeared in the regular ML. *The Selected Writings of Gertrude Stein* (547) was published in 1963, followed by *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* (623) in 1980. However, *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* was reprinted in Random House’s quality paperback series, Modern Library Paperbacks, in fall 1955. After Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, the Knopf series Vintage Books became the quality paperback imprint for the combined firm, and later paperback printings of *The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* appeared in Vintage Books.

The next four years would be difficult, as publishers struggled with a huge increase in demand for books coupled with scarcity of resources, including paper rationing, the absence of personnel who served in the armed services, and other dislocations caused by the war. The end of the war in August 1945 was accompanied by rapid inflation and a wave of strikes that disrupted the return to a peacetime economy. It would be September 1948 before the Modern Library could announce, “Every title in the Modern Library and the Modern Library Giants is now back in stock for the first time since the war” (Modern Library advertisement, *Publishers’ Weekly*, September 17, 1948, p. 1095). Ten titles were added to the ML and ten were discontinued. The number of titles in the series remained at 219, the same as in 1940. Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. The enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through spring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers featured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by a pattern of open books and “ml” initials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through spring 1966. Two 1941 titles (Saroyan, *Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* and Bemelmans, *My War with the United States*) were originally published by Random House; their ML jackets were adapted from the RH jackets. The Saroyan jacket was designed by Ernest Reichl, and the jacket for *My War with the United States* featured an adaptation of one of Bemelmans’s illustrations. \n\nThe jacket for Steinbeck, *The Grapes of Wrath* incorporated a reproduction of Thomas Hart Benton’s lithograph “Departure of the Joads” from his Grapes of Wrath series. Paul Galdone was responsible for three jackets: Hugo, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was an individually designed pictorial jacket; *Five Great Modern Irish Plays* and Lardner, *Collected Stories* featured a decorative non-pictorial design that was used on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s. \n\nPascal, *Pensées & The Provincial Letters*, had a typographic jacket that was clearly designed by Joseph Blumenthal. Three other predominately typographic jackets were probably also by Blumenthal, who signed none of his jackets. *The Federalist* featured a decorative image of an American eagle, Proust’s *The Captive* had a small silhouette of Proust in left profile that was also used on the other six titles of *Remembrance of Things Past*, and Plato’s *Republic* had an inset photographic image of a bust of Plato. 95 cents. (Spring) Hugo, *Hunchback of Notre Dame* xBemelmans, *My War with the United States*; Giants through G56; jackets: 271 (=spring 1940). (Fall) Bemelmans, *My War with the United States* xLewis, *Babbitt*; Giants through G58 with G20–21 Symonds, *Renaissance in Italy*; jackets: 278. Cerf expressed interest in Ernest Hemingway’s *For Whom the Bell Tolls*, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1940: “This is one book above almost any other that has been written in the past five years that I’d like to see on the Modern Library list when the time comes” (Cerf to Max Perkins, 23 July 1941). The ML never secured reprint rights. In 1953 Scribner’s served notice that it was withdrawing all three Hemingway titles in the ML—*The Sun Also Rises* (190), *A Farewell to Arms* (237), and *The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway* (G59)—in order to publish their own reprint editions in all English-speaking markets in North America. \n\nConrad Aiken repeated his suggestion for a ML edition of his first novel, *Blue Voyage*, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1927 (Aiken to Cerf, 19 May 1941). Aiken edited several poetry anthologies for the ML, but he never had a book of his own in the series.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1942 1942 The war brought many changes to Random House. Klopfer, who was thirty-nine, applied for a commission in the Air Force. He was commissioned as a captain in May 1942 and left for training in California at the end of the month. He was away from Random House until after the war. The war years were good ones for him. He was posted to England with the Eighth Air Force in October 1943 and served as an intelligence officer for a heavy bomber squadron—the job he wanted. When he stopped by Random House to say his final goodbyes before leaving for London, Cerf thought he looked “happier and more excited than I have ever seen him in my life before” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library). Early the following year he was promoted to major (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 12 February 1944, p. 19).\n\nCerf was four years older than Klopfer and too old for military service. He remained a civilian, looking after Random House and playing an active role in the Council on Books in Wartime, of which he was a director. “I get damned impatient plugging away at publishing,” he told a friend in the service in 1943, “while all of you fellows are out there doing things I’d like to be doing myself, but I may as well face the fact that I am 45, that I am nearsighted as a bat, and that somebody has to keep Random House rolling along” (Cerf to Smart, 26 August 1943, Random House Collection).\n\nRandom House rolled through the war years with increasing momentum. The firm was fortunate in that Klopfer was the only senior member who left to enter the service. Commins, several years older than Cerf, remained at Random House throughout the war, as did Haas, who was in his early fifties. It was Haas, however, who was touched most deeply by the war. His son, a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy, was killed in action in 1943.\n\nRandom House had grown slowly in the 1930s. Each year sales increased over the previous year, but the increases were often small. The firm’s sales did not reach a million dollars until 1941. Beginning with sales of \\$256,000 in 1926, it took Cerf and Klopfer fifteen years to reach the million-dollar figure. Thereafter, sales increased rapidly. Cerf wrote in 1943, “I think we have reached the major leagues as publishers now, and I damn well mean for us to stay there” (Cerf to Smart, 26 August 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\n\nPart of Random House’s wartime growth could be attributed to a series of best-selling war books. The firm’s first big seller in this category was Cecil Brown’s *Suez to Singapore*, about the sinking of the British battleship *Prince of Wales* and the battle cruiser *Repulse* several days after Pearl Harbor. It appeared in August 1942. Shortly thereafter came Richard Tregaskis’s *Guadalcanal Diary*, published in January 1943. It was the first Random House book to sell over 100,000 copies (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 163). Random House’s next big war book was *Thirty Seconds over Tokyo* by Ted W. Lawson.\n\nDuring the war Cerf began to be well-known to the public at large as a writer and speaker. He took over the “Trade Winds” column in *Saturday Review of Literature* in February 1942. For the next fifteen years he enlivened the magazine’s pages with a weekly mixture of publishing gossip, jokes, and stories. He also began to compile what became a long series of best-selling humor books. The first, *The Pocket Book of War Humor*, was an original paperback published by Pocket Books early in 1943. It was a collection, edited by Cerf, of previously published material. His objective in compiling it was to do something to dispel the widespread despondency that followed the American loss of the Philippines and Bataan (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 174). The book sold over a million copies.\n\nCerf’s next project was a collection of humorous anecdotes and stories, *Try and Stop Me*, published by Simon and Schuster in 1944. It became a bestseller and was widely distributed in an Armed Services Edition to members of the armed services around the world. “It was just the kind of book they needed and appreciated—it made them laugh,” Cerf later recalled (*At Random*, p. 181). He subsequently wrote many other humor books, but he always regarded *Try and Stop Me* as his best (*At Random*, p. 180). The book led to a newspaper column syndicated to several hundred newspapers by King Features. Also called “Try and Stop Me,” it started as a serialization of the book, but when that material was used up, Cerf supplied new stories and jokes to keep the column going. But Cerf never overestimated his own publications. In a 1945 letter to Gertrude Stein, whom he had not seen since before the war, he wrote:\n\n> You write asking whether I have changed any since you saw me last. I honestly don’t think I have. I am a bit grayer, of course, and don’t get around a tennis court quite as fast as I used to, but I like to think that my whole attitude to life hasn’t changed a bit. Certainly I am getting more fun out of it today than I ever did before. Besides the publishing, which has gone beautifully, I have been writing trivia for magazines and in book form and, while I know it is utterly unimportant drivel, people seem to like it and want more of it (Cerf to Gertrude Stein, 17 March 1945, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).\n\nWhen a reader wrote Cerf in 1954 suggesting that his humor books be brought together and published as a ML Giant, he responded that he was flattered. “But quite honestly,” he added, “I’m not good enough” (Cerf to Ralph Winans, 22 July 1954, Random House Collection).\n\nCerf was as engaging a speaker as he was a writer. His first major exposure came with tours of well-known writers selling war bonds for the Treasury Department. This was followed by a weekly radio program for the Council of Books in Wartime called “Books Are Bullets” in which he interviewed authors of war books. The radio program led to lecture tours through the Colston Leigh Agency. By the early 1950s, through extensive lecturing and, even more so, as a result of his participation as a regular panelist on the Sunday evening television program “What’s My Line,” Cerf had become a celebrity. He enjoyed being a celebrity, and the publicity he attracted brought enhanced recognition of Random House among the public at large. The War Production Board was established in January 1942, a few weeks after the United States entered the war. Its purpose was to direct war production and assign priorities to the delivery of scarce materials. Paper use in the publishing industry was limited in the fall of 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota based on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were restricted to 90 per cent of the amount of paper they used before the war. This was not a severe hardship, especially compared with Britain, where publishers in 1942 were having to get by with 37½ per cent of the paper they used in 1939 (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 29 August 1942, p. 20). But the restrictions became increasingly severe as the war went on. There was an additional 10 per cent cut in 1943, and a further 15 per cent cut the following year (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 26 August 1943; Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library).] Thirteen titles were added during 1942 and five titles were discontinued. This brought the number of titles in the ML list to 227. Modern Library title pages continued to be individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the ML’s printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in fall 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green, or gray cloth with lettering in gold on inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color on the spine and front cover. Inset panels of red bindings were usually black or dark blue; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. The enlarged version of Rockwell Kent’s endpaper, redesigned to fit the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format, was introduced in spring 1940 and used through spring 1967. The central panels of the paste-down and free endpapers featured Kent’s torchbearer surrounded by pattern of open books and “ml” initials. The endpapers were printed in gray from fall 1940 through spring 1966. All 1942 jackets were individually designed except *Collected Stories of Dorothy Parker* (353)*,* which used a decorative non-pictorial jacket designed by Paul Galdone that was used on six ML titles between fall 1939 and the early 1940s. Galdone was also responsible for three other jackets: Ward, *Oracles of Nostradamus* (346); Lewis, *Babbitt* (348); and Hellman, *Four Plays* (351). Joseph Blumenthal designed three typographic jackets: Tacitus, *Complete Works* (350); Milton, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (354); and Santayana, *Philosophy* (355). E. McKnight Kauffer was responsible for three pictorial jackets: Wright, *Native Son* (349); Maurois, *Disraeli* (352); and Bellamy, *Looking Backward* (357). The designers of two pictorial jackets, Crane, *Red Badge of Courage* (347) and Byrne, *Messer Marco Polo* (356), have not been identified. 95 cents. (Spring) Lewis, *Babbitt* xMaurois, *Disraeli*; Giants through G58 with G21 *Sixteen Famous American Plays*; jackets: 281. (Fall) Maurois, *Disraeli* xDu Maurier, *Rebecca*; Giants through G60; jackets: 284.\n\n*Note:* New titles for fall 1942 have spring 1942 lists of ML titles inside the jackets. This oversight probably reflects the absence of Klopfer, who had been responsible for the printing and production of ML books before his departure in May to serve in the Air Force. Lists of ML titles at the end of the volumes were not affected. Both of the fall 1942 titles that include lists—Parker, *Collected Stories* (353) and Milton, *Complete Poetry and Selected Prose* (354a)—have fall 1942 lists at the end of the volume No war books as such were included in the ML. Cerf tried to secure reprint rights to Hitler’s *Mein Kampf* for the ML, but Houghton Mifflin, the original American publisher, was bringing out a new edition of their own (Cerf to Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, 4 November 1942; Linscott to Cerf, 6 November 1942).\n\nShortly after Random House published *The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne & Complete Poetry of William Blake* (RH, 1941; ML Giant, 1946) W. H. Auden suggested a ML volume of poetry by Andrew Marvell, George Herbert, and Henry Vaughan. Commins responded, “You have probably guessed that the Donne-Blake book has most of its sales in colleges where both poets are considered in every course on English literature. This does not apply to Marvell, Herbert or Vaughan . . . such a book would not achieve sufficient sales to cover the very high cost of manufacturing it” (Commins to Auden, 14 January 1942).\n\nHenry Hoyns, a veteran employee of Harper & Bros. who had recently been appointed president of the firm, suggested Louis Adamic’s *Grandsons*, Evelyn Eaton’s *Quietly My Captain Waits*, André Maurois’s *Chateaubriand*, and Frederic Prokosch’s *The Seven Who Fled* for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 19 January 1942), but none of these Harper titles was appropriate for the series. Hoyns subsequently suggested a ML edition of Hesketh Pearson’s biography, *Gilbert and Sullivan* (Harper, 1935), but Cerf thought it would more appropriate for the Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday imprint that specialized in reprint editions (Cerf to Hoyns, 15 September 1942).\n\nHarry E. Maule, a Random House editor, suggested a ML edition of Sinclair Lewis’s *Main Street* (Maule to Cerf, 12 March 1942), but Lewis’s *Babbitt* (348) had been added to the series a month before. Lewis himself suggested a ML volume of the poetry of Carl Sandberg, Vachel Lindsay, and Edgar Lee Masters, but Cerf indicated that it might be impossible to obtain reprint rights (Cerf to Sinclair Lewis, 14 September, 1942).\n\nKlopfer rejected a suggestion by Marshall Best of Viking Press for a ML edition of Upton Sinclair’s *The Jungle*, stating “the book is dated” (Klopfer to Best, 31 March 1942). George Duplaix suggested *The True History of the Conquest of Mexico* by Bernal Díaz del Castillo. Max Lerner suggested Maxim Gorky’s autobiographical trilogy, *My Childhood*, *In the World*, and *My Universities*, with an introduction by his former wife, Anita Marburg (Lerner to Commins, 1 December 1942).\n\nCerf made the first of several attempts to secure reprint rights to Aldous Huxley’s *Brave New World*. It would be another fourteen years before Huxley’s novel appeared in the series. Cerf wanted to add [Antoine de Saint-Exupery](http://www.amazon.com/Antoine-de-Saint-Exupery/e/B000AQ4I8O/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1)’s *Wind, Sand and Stars* to the ML in late 1942 or early 1943 (Cerf to Eugene Reynal, 6 February 1942), but reprint rights do not appear to have been available. Other works sought for the ML that never appeared in the series included Archibald MacLeish’s selected poems and James Henry Breasted’s *Conquest of Civilization* (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, 31 July 1942).

Klopfer, who was thirty-nine, applied for a commission in the Air Force. He was commissioned as a captain in May 1942 and left for training in California at the end of the month. He was away from Random House until after the war. The war years were good ones for him. He was posted to England with the Eighth Air Force in October 1943 and served as an intelligence officer for a heavy bomber squadron—the job he wanted. When he stopped by Random House to say his final goodbyes before leaving for London, Cerf thought he looked “happier and more excited than I have ever seen him in my life before” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943, Random House Collection, Columbia University Library). Early the following year he was promoted to major (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *Saturday Review of Literature*, 12 February 1944, p. 19). [object Object]",

They turned in large numbers to reading as an alternative. Demand for books was such that almost anything publishers brought out was snatched-up. Few publishers had ever encountered such demand for books and the experience was dazzling. But it also had drawbacks. “When you are able to sell any junk that you can get between covers,” Cerf commented, “it takes the kick out of putting over the really good numbers” (Cerf to Charles Allen Smart, 19 October 1943). Between 1942 and 1943, sales of ML books increased from \\$339,902 to \\$596,454. \n\nThe war brought not only increased demand for books in general but also shifts in demand for certain types of books. Books dealing with the war itself were popular. But there also seems to have been increased demand for books dealing with human values. Cerf reported that sales of poetry and philosophy titles in the Modern Library increased at a disproportionate rate and that demand for them was especially strong among men in the service. \n\nThe Modern Library’s most notable new venture in the 1940s was a series called the Illustrated Modern Library. It was launched in 1943 in the midst of the war. Each volume contained specially commissioned illustrations by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Warren Chappell, Salvador Dali, Fritz Eichenberg, George Grosz, E. McNight Kauffer, Fritz Kredel, Boardman Robinson, William Sharp, and Edward Wilson. The volumes were one-quarter-inch taller than regular ML volumes and were issued in individually designed slipcases. The first five titles appeared in 1943 in time for the Christmas season. Fourteen additional titles were issued between 1944 and 1946. Volumes of the Illustrated Modern Library initially sold for \\$1.50 a copy. Rising production costs after the war forced the discontinuation of the series. Seven titles were added to the series and three were discontinued, bringing the total number of titles in the list to 231. Titles published in 1943 were 7¼ x 4⅞ inch page size with individually designed title pages. Many of the title pages were designed by Joseph Blumenthal, who set them at his Spiral Press and made electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printers. The binding, also designed by Blumenthal, consisted of stiff boards covered with smooth linen. Blumenthal’s binding employed inset panels in black, dark red, or dark blue on the spine and front cover, upon which the title was stamped in gold. Kent’s torchbearer was stamped in gold above the inset panel on the spine and below the inset panel at the right. The panels were bordered in gold, and the running torchbearer appeared in gold outside each panel. \n\nThe bindings were red, blue, green, or gray. Unlike the balloon cloth bindings used from 1929 through spring 1939, each printing of a given title was available in only one color. \n\nRockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ by 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers; for the rest of the endpapers, there were torchbearers on the paste-down and free endpapers facing each other, light brownish gray (63); endpapers in medium orange (53). 95 cents (Spring) Du Maurier, *Rebecca* xShakespeare; Giants through G62; jackets: 291. (Fall) Shakespeare xJefferson, *Life and Selected Writings*; Giants through G63; jackets: 292. McKeon had an idea for a collection entitled *Medieval Philosophers*. Cerf asked Hoyns for reprint rights to Fosdick’s *On Being a Real Person*, saying it was “one of the finest books that has been published in the past ten years,” and offering a \\$5,000 advance (Cerf to Hoyns, 12 November 1943). \n\nHoyns suggested Silone’s *The Seed Beneath the Snow* and Algren’s *Never Come Morning* for the ML (Hoyns to Cerf, 20 May 1943). \n\nCerf declined to add an Elizabeth Bowen novel, noting “I don’t think that there will be a sufficient demand for any of Elizabeth Bowen’s novels to justify such an addition to the Modern Library series” (Cerf to Brown, 20 July 1943).

Barnes & Co., Inc.*  </center>\n\n<center> *Distributed by Random House, Inc.* </center>\n\nPaper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in demand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable to satisfy the demand for books. \n\nThe War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry in fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota based on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to 90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions became increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional 10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year. \n\nMost publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a few—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In fall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the textbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated Modern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board requirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series while RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles, including those noted above, were also published under this arrangement. The ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several other publishers that had surplus paper. \n\nThe War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in March 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers were able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from college text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for the duration [of the war]. We counted on doing the same this year. When the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire production schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944). \n\nAll subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by Random House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML stopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued to appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to go out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The profit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants were paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML books, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length. \n\nA. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the Illustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was limited. Random House continued to select titles for the series, commission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate making, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were reprinted. Nine titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now contained 239 titles. The 1943 format was unchanged for the 1944 publications. All new titles in the regular ML were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x 118 mm). Bindings were red, blue, green or gray. Rockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ x 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers. 95 cents (Spring) Jefferson, *Life and Selected Writings* xParker, *Collected Poetry*; Giants through G65 (=fall 1944); jackets: 299.

In the later part of 1945, no Giants were available except the newly published *Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry*. There was no prospect of the Modern Library being completely in-stock again, Cerf wrote, for “a full year from now or even longer, depending entirely on the progress of the global war and the restoration of the normal paper supply in the book business” (Cerf to H. Hugh Herbert, 26 April, 1945). Eight titles were added and two were discontinued, bringing the total number of ML titles to 245.

The firm had occupied rented offices at 20 East 57th Street since 1927 but had to move after International Business Machines (IBM) bought the building. The jackets of the first ML printings of *The Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau* (384) and Koestler’s *Darkness at Noon* (385) list the old address on the back panel. The Madison Avenue address appears on the back panel beginning with Hersey’s *A Bell for Adano* (386), published in April. The Madison Avenue building consisted of the north wing of a mansion originally built in 1885 for Henry Villard. The north wing (one of five separate units) was owned for many years by the Fahnestock family and had been purchased by Joseph P. Kennedy in 1944. Random House bought it from Kennedy for \\$420,000 and spent an additional \\$100,000 renovating and furnishing it. Eleven titles were added and five were discontinued, bringing the total number of titles to 251. New titles issued in 1946 in the regular ML were published in the standard format used over the war years with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x 118 mm). Bindings were brown, blue, green or gray. \n\nInset panels of brown bindings were usually black; the panels of blue bindings were usually red; those of green bindings were usually black; and those of gray bindings were usually green. \n\nThe inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold.

The price increase was the first for the regular ML since May 1920. The first new title published at \\$1.10 was Rawlings, *The Yearling* (391), but the \\$1.10 price was short lived. The retail price increased to \\$1.25 on 15 April 1947. The ML printed the list price at the top of the jacket flap, and first printings of titles published at 95 cents and \\$1.10 are commonly found in price-clipped jackets. (Spring) Hersey, *Bell for Adano* xBalzac, *Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet*; Giants through G68; jackets: 309. (Fall) Balzac, *Père Goriot & Eugénie Grandet* xAristotle, *Introduction*; Giants through G70; jackets: 316. William Rose, Jr., the president of Harper &Brothers, cancelled a proposed ML reprint of James Henry Breasted’s *The Conquest of Civilization* (1926; rev. ed., 1938), noting that the book was basically a trade edition of Breasted’s textbook *Ancient Times* (Ginn & Co., 1916; 2nd ed., 1935). Ginn was concerned that a 95-cent ML edition would hurt sales of *Ancient Times* in college towns (Rose to Cerf, 5 July 1946). Klopfer rejected a suggestion to include H. G. Wells’s *History of Mr. Polly* in the ML (Klopfer to Frank Dodd, 9 September 1946). The ML also decided against Sigmund Freud’s *Leonardo da Vinci* (Dodd, Mead, 1932), which was not included in *The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud* (Giant, 1938). A. A. Brill, who had translated *Leonardo da Vinci* and edited the Giant, sent a copy to Commins for consideration, indicating that Dodd, Mead was willing to return all rights to the book (A. A.

Frank Taylor and Albert Erskine joined the editorial staff in 1947 after becoming dissatisfied at Reynal & Hitchcock. Saxe Commins, one of the great editors of his era, remained editor in chief of the Modern Library. Although officially in charge of the series at this period, judging from evidence in the Random House archives, his involvement was small. \n\nSales at Random House continued to grow. With Giants back in-stock after the paper rationing of the war years, sales increased from their low in 1945 of \\$92,085 to \\$544,632 in 1947. Sales of titles in the regular ML also continued to increase; \\$834,907 in 1946 to \\$946,415 in 1947. Ten titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now contained 260 titles. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Two shades of gray (265 med.; 266 dk.) were used for the binding. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. \\$1.10 (January–14 April); \\$1.25 (15 April–December). Three of the spring titles (*Introduction to Aristotle*, *The Best Short Stories of Bret Harte*, and *The Eustace Diamonds*) were published at \\$1.10. *The Best of S. J. Perelman* (395) and Caldwell, *Tobacco Road* (397) did not appear until May and were published with \\$1.25 price stickers on the jacket flaps. All fall titles were published at \\$1.25. \n\nThe \\$1.10 retail price introduced in November 1946 lasted for less than six months. Costs continued to rise, and Klopfer advised Cerf in February that another price increase was likely. Cerf, who was vacationing in Beverly Hills, replied: “If we <u>must</u> boost ML to \\$1.25, let’s get it over with, & for God’s sake alter jacket copy so that price appears <u>only</u> on detachable flap. Some stores out here are selling ML <u>without</u> jackets to avoid squabbles on price. This ain’t good!” (Klopfer to Cerf, 14 February 1947; Cerf to Klopfer, 23 February 1947, underlining in original). \n\nBeginning in fall 1947 the retail price was printed on the top corner of the jacket flap where it could be clipped off easily, and the price was omitted from the back panel of the jacket. Since most of the jackets in stores still bore the printed price of \\$1.10 or even 95 cents, booksellers were supplied with gummed price-change stickers to be affixed to the flaps. These read: “As of April 15, 1947, the price of The Modern Library in U.S.A. is \\$1.25 a copy. Other markings void.

(Fall) Lewis, *Dodsworth* xAquinas, *Introduction*; Giants through G72; jackets: 329. Cerf continued to make offers for James Stephens, *The* *Crock of Gold*, but was informed that Macmillan still planned to reissue it (James Putnam to Cerf, 8 May 1947). The Macmillan reprint appeared later that year. He also wanted Lytton Strachey’s *Elizabeth and Essex* for the ML, but the Harcourt, Brace edition was selling too well as a textbook. S. Spenser Scott of Harcourt, Brace wrote Cerf, “I am sure that you will agree that the Modern Library books do compete with the textbook editions—and well they should, because you have done a grand job on getting them into college stores” (Scott to Cerf, 24 September 1947). \n\nCerf declined Wendell Wilkie’s *One World* when Manuel Siwek of Grosset & Dunlap suggested it for the ML (Cerf to Siwek, 10 June 1947). He also rejected Wallace Stegner’s novel *Big Rock Candy Mountain*, indicating that the plates were too large for the regular series and that it wouldn’t have sufficient sales for Modern Library Giants (Cerf to Charles Duell, 2 October 1947).

Rose also offered reprint rights to Thomas Wolfe’s *You Can’t Go Home Again*, but Klopfer appears to have considered that Wolfe was adequately represented by *Look Homeward, Angel*, which had been available as a ML Giant since 1934 (Klopfer to Rose, 27 September 1948).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1949 1949 The postwar history of the Modern Library can be regarded as dating from the beginning of 1949. That era of the ML’s history was shaped by two major developments: the continuing expansion and consolidation of the paperback revolution and the growth in college enrollments that increased the importance of the college market. \n\nCerf saw paperbacks as a serious competition from the beginning. He tried to discourage Robert deGraff from issuing too many ML titles in paperback Pocket Book editions. When the ML had exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted titles, he usually prevented deGraff from publishing them. Cerf and Klopfer refused in the fall of 1939 to allow Pocket Books to publish two titles that deGraff wanted: Vincent Sheean’s *Personal History*, which was due to appear in the ML in January, 1940, and Irving Stone’s *Lust for Life*, which had been in the ML for less than a year. \n\nOften the ML did not have exclusive reprint rights to copyrighted works. The terms of individual contracts varied and there were many instances in which a book was available both in the ML and in a Grosset & Dunlap or other hardbound reprint edition. Even if the ML had exclusive reprint rights, the customary reprint contract was renewable at five-year intervals. If the ML resisted an original publisher’s desire to release paperback rights, the original publisher could withdraw the work from the ML when the contract expired. \n\nBefore the war was over, Cerf came to accept the existence of paperback editions of ML titles as inevitable. Accepting this fact was made easier by the discovery in most cases the paperback edition did not seriously affect the ML sales. However, Random House did not enter the quality paperback market until January 1955 with a series called Modern Library Paperbacks. \n\nRandom House responded to growth in the college market for quality books earlier when they launched the Modern Library College Editions in 1950 under the direction of Jess Stein. Eleven new titles were added to the ML and five were discontinued, bringing the total number of titles in the regular series to 271. Modern Library title pages were individually designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single-color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. \\$1.25.

(Fall) Byron, *Don Juan* xJames, *Washington Square*; Giants through G73 with G9 DeQuincey, *Selected Writings*; jackets: 344. Morton Dauwen Zabel, professor of English at the University of Chicago, suggested a ML edition of Joseph Conrad’s *Under Western Eyes*. He wrote, “I can think of no novel of Conrad’s outside of Lord Jim, Victory, and Heart of Darkness (all of them already included in the Modern Library) which more deserves to be known. The general neglect of it, hitherto, is a shame” (Zabel to Jess Stein, 31 October 1949). Stein forwarded the suggestion to Cerf, but the general consensus was that there was insufficient demand to justify a ML edition.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1950 1950 In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library College Editions. All of the early titles were taken from the regular Modern Library series. They were issued in paper covers and sold initially at sixty-five cents a copy—sixty cents less than regular Modern Library books. To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they were issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward the academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a distinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new series had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath Brooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson, Royal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray, Mark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and Morton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in regular Modern Library printings as well. \n\nMany of the notable publishing ventures that Random House has undertaken over the year have come about when someone at Random House—more often than not Cerf himself—perceived a need for books that was not being met. In contrast, there was nothing innovative about Modern Library College Editions nor were they a direct result of publishing inspiration. They were, quite simply, introduced to compete with another series that was beginning to eat into the Modern Library’s college market with their regular Modern Library series. \n\nThat series was Rinehart Editions, started by Rinehart & Co. in late 1948. Rinehart Editions were paperback volumes of literary classics aimed specifically at the college market. Priced from fifty to seventy-five cents, they were substantially cheaper than the hardbound volumes of the regular Modern Library. Moreover, their texts were well-edited, with up-to-date introductions by eminent academics. \n\nThe Modern Library College Editions were under the direction of Jess Stein. He selected the first group of titles for the College Editions from the Modern Library series through examining 1949 college bookstore orders from principle universities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois. \n\nThe Random House juvenile department, already well established with such authors as Dr. Seuss and Walter Farley, became even more important to the firm when the Landmark Books series on American History was launched in 1950. Nine new titles were added and four discontinued in the regular ML series, bringing the total titles to 276. There were an additional 74 titles in the Giants. The Modern Library College Editions launched with 41 titles of non-royalty-bearing works. Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels on the spine and front cover in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green). Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. \\$1.25. (Spring) James, *Washington Square* xAlcott, *Little Women*; Giants through G74; jackets: 347. (Fall) Alcott, *Little Women* xCicero, *Basic Works*; Giants through G75 with G57 Brooks, *Flowering of New England*; jackets: 348. Gordon S. Haight of Yale University suggested George Eliot’s *Middlemarch* for ML College Editions and offered to write an introduction (Haight to Jess Stein, 26 January 1950). He wrote again six months later: “You will find all the contemporary English critics like Leavis, Pritchett, Joan Bennett, and the rest echoing Virginia Woolf’s opinion about *Middlemarch* as the great novel of the 19th Century. It is back now on the Cambridge Tripos, and within four or five years, will be a standard required book in every English course. The Everyman and World’s Classics series are the only ones that include it now, but by the time the Modern Library gets around to it, there may be others who have anticipated the change in critical estimate” (Haight to Stein, 15 June 1950). Jess Stein, who edited the ML’s new paperback series, Modern Library College Editions, indicated that it was too long to be published at the uniform retail price of 65 cents and noted, “There are some titles in the College Editions that do run long, but all of them so far are assured top sellers, while *Middlemarch*, although rated high critically, does not so far carry the same assurance of large sales as, say, *Anna Karenina*. . . . The status of *Middlemarch* on our list here is simply this: as soon as we have reason to believe that we can at least break even on *Middlemarch* we will include it” (Stein to Haight, 20 June 1950). *Middlemarch* (636) did not appear in the ML until 1984. \n\nJess Stein suggested several titles for the regular ML, including Joseph Conrad’s *Nostromo* and *The Nigger of the Narcissus*, Theodore Dreiser’s *An American Tragedy*, George Eliot’s *Adam Bede*, Oliver Goldsmith’s *Vicar of Wakefield*, three works by Henry James (*Daisy Miller*, *The American*, and *The Golden Bowl*), Franz Kafka’s *The Castle*, Jack London’s *Call of the Wild*, Lucretius’s *On the Nature of Things*, Frank Norris’s *The Pit*, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s *Quo Vadis*, Ignazio Silone’s *Bread and Wine*, Edmund Spenser’s *Faerie Queen*, Henri Stendhal’s *Charterhouse of Parma*, Mark Twain’s *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*, Edith Wharton’s *Ethan Frome*, Owen Wister’s *The Virginian*, and Emile Zola’s *Germinal* (Stein to Cerf, 10 October 1950). The following titles on Stein’s list were published in the regular series or ML Giants: Conrad, *Nostromo* (1951: 438); Dreiser, *An American Tragedy* (1950: G89); Goldsmith, *Vicar of Wakefield and Other Writings* (1955: 476); Kafka, *The Castle* (1969: 610); and Spenser, *Selected Poetry* (1964: G104). Twain’s *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* was available as part of a ML Giant that included *Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1940: G47) and in the 1980s was published as a volume of its own (1985: 642). Two titles on Stein’s list were former ML titles that had been discontinued: James, *Daisy Miller; An International Episode* (1918: 60) and Stendhal, *Charterhouse of Parma* (1937: 298). \n\nSomerset Maugham suggested a ML edition of William James’s *[Principles of Psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology)y* (Maugham to Cerf, 14 May 1950). Richmond Lattimore suggested a ML volume of Greek poetry and offered to do the translations himself (Lattimore to Stein, 21 July 1950), but Cerf and Klopfer do not appear to have been enthusiastic about the proposal.

Harcourt, Brace never added it to the new series, and *Flowering Judas* was restored to the ML in spring 1953. \n\n#### ***Spring*** In 1950 Random House launched a series for classroom use, Modern Library College Editions.

To enhance their usefulness as college texts, they were issued with new introductions commissioned from and directed toward the academic community. The authors of the new introductions were a distinguished group. The forty-one titles that inaugurated the new series had introductions by such figures as Eric Bentley, Clenath Brooks, E.K. Brown, David Daiches, Bergen Evans, Francis Fergusson, Royal A. Gettmann, Gilbert Highet, Herbert J. Muller, Gordon N. Ray, Mark Schorer, Henri Troyat, Mark Van Doren, Edward Wagenknecht, and Morton Dauwen Zabel. The new introductions were subsequently included in regular Modern Library printings as well.

The series maintained close ties with the regular Modern Library series during this time. Most titles continued to be selected from the regular Modern Library series and adapted with new introductions for the college market. However, anthologies of works by Browning, Byron, Keats, and Shelley were compiled especially for Modern Library College Editions. The Keats and Shelley anthologies were also published in the regular Modern Library in spring 1951; the Browning and Byron volumes were added to the regular series in 1954. \n\nTen additional titles were added to the College Editions in January, 1951. In contrast to the initial group of forty-one non-royalty bearing titles, several of those added in 1951 required royalty payments. Despite these additions, the Modern Library College Editions began to encounter difficulties in its second year. Production costs were going up and college enrollments temporarily declined as the pool of former soldiers attending college on the G.I bill exhausted. The series did not fully recover until 1956. Thereafter, sales continued to be strong. The series maintained its position in the 1960s when the regular Modern Library began to falter and continued throughout the 1970s after the regular series became moribund. Twelve new titles were added to the series and two titles were superseded by more current editions. This brought the total titles available to 288. All new titles were published in the 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal, Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray, and the top edge stained to match the inset panels on the spine and front cover. Modern Library title pages continued to be designed by Joseph Blumenthal, the proprietor of the celebrated Spiral Press. He created the title pages himself, setting them at the Spiral Press and making electrotype plates for the use of the Modern Library’s regular printer. The books were printed by Parkway Printing Co. and bound by H. Wolff Book Manufacturing Co. \n\nThe binding that Blumenthal designed for the ML’s 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format was introduced in 1939 and used through 1962. The bindings used smooth linen over stiff boards. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover. Each printing of a given title was typically bound in a single color combination. The inset panels on the spine and front cover were framed in gold. Rockwell Kent’s torchbearer (facing right) was stamped in gold above the panel on the spine. The panel on the front cover had a second gold frame outside the colored inner panel, within which Kent’s torchbearer (facing left) was stamped in gold. \\$1.25.

Cerf wanted to include an abridged edition of Havelock Ellis’s *Studies in the Psychology of Sex* in ML Giants, but the ML was unable to secure reprint rights (Cerf to Klopfer, 17 March 1950; 22 March 1951). \n\nSuggested titles that were declined included J. B. Priestley’s *The Good Companions* (Klopfer to William Rose, 12 February 1951) and *Mark Twain’s America* by Bernard DeVoto.

Jess Stein, who came to Random House after the war to work on *The American College Dictionary* and stayed to work with reference books and college texts, was the first to alert Random House of the implications of this development. He alerted Lewis Miller in the following memo: \n\n> I now have a little more information about the Doubleday paperbacks which were the subject of the rumor I heard yesterday. This new series apparently will appear in April with 12 titles and prices will range from 65¢ to 95¢. The type of material in these books will be the kind that usually appears in the Mentor series (Stein, Memorandum to Miller, 18 September 1952). \n\nDoubleday and Charles Scribner’s Sons were two of the publishing houses that withdrew reprint contracts for some of the best titles in the Modern Library during 1952. The Scribner’s withdrawal was especially difficult for the Modern Library, since the titles were the best-known works of Ernest Hemingway. The firm had decided to promote its backlist more vigorously. When plans were made to issue Hemingway’s works in a uniform edition, Scribner’s decided to terminate the Modern Library’s reprint contracts. \n\nCerf was dismayed at the news. Losing Hemingway from the Modern Library was an unwelcome prospect. As Klopfer stated later, “The Modern Library has enormous prestige as a series of literary books and there are very few living American authors who deserve to be included in it, and certainly Ernest Hemingway belongs there” (Klopfer to Darrow, 13 July 1954). Eight titles were added and six were discontinued, bringing titles in the list to 290. New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray. Books were bound in red, blue, green or gray cloth with inset rectangular panels in a contrasting color (black, dark blue, red or green) on the spine and front cover.

He wanted to publish a ML edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *Tender is the Night* (Cerf to Whitney Darrow, 10 April 1952). He also wanted to include a book by John Galsworthy in the series but was not interested in any of the titles that Scribner’s were willing to consider.

In 1954, Cerf commented, “Our business gross continues to be fine, but more and more it’s the staples and Modern Library and Landmarks. The new novels are simply not selling at all” (Cerf to Klopfer, 15 September 1954). \n\nSaxe Commins, officially the editor-in-chief for the Modern Library, suffered a heart attack in August 1953 and had little involvement with the Modern Library thereafter. Jess Stein was placed in charge of the Modern Library during Commins’s illness and he remained in charge after Commins’s return. Responsibility for the series was added to his existing oversight for the Modern Library College Editions. Nine titles were added, four titles were discontinued, and one title was superseded. Titles in the list now numbered 295. Beginning in fall 1953, ML jacket flaps were printed in sans serif type; the back panel of the jacket was also redesigned using sans serif type.

He also expressed interest in a volume of Frank O’Connor short stories (Cerf to O’Connor, 25 May 1953). Joseph Prescott suggested Faulkner’s *Intruder in the Dust* for the ML (Prescott to ML, 20 February 1953). Gordon S.

Initially, Random House was attracted by the idea of obtaining rights for the Modern Library of a number of new translations commissioned for Penguin Classics, a distinguished and highly successful series that began in 1946. Several of the translations then used by the Modern Library had been criticized as outdated or faulty in other respects—Peter Motteaux’s 1700 translation, revised by John Ozell in 1719, of Cervantes’s *Don Quixote*; the Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *Iliad* and *Odyssey*; Constance Garnett’s translation of Chekhov’s *Plays*; and anonymous translations of plays by Moliere and Ibsen. Penguin Classics had superior translations of these and other works. \n\nIn March 1954, Klopfer received a letter from Milton Waldman of the British publishing firm Rupert Hart-Davis, who wrote that Lane had expressed an interest in arranging for joint publication of various classics with the Modern Library (Milton Waldman to Klopfer, 31 March 1954). Jess Stein was given the job of examining the translations in Penguin Classics. He prepared a long memorandum for Klopfer in which he indicated which Penguin translations would be desirable for the Modern Library. However, nothing came of the negotiations with Lane and in 1955, Random House launched the Modern Library Paperbacks. Eight titles were added and five were discontinued. This brought the number of available titles in the Modern Library to 298. New titles were published in the standard 7¼ x 4⅞ inch format with the stiff linen binding designed by Joseph Blumenthal with Rockwell Kent’s endpaper in gray.

The Modern Library sought reprint rights for Rachel Carson’s *The Sea Around Us* (Klopfer to Cerf, 2 February 1954). Cerf asked Harcourt, Brace for Orwell’s *1984*, but was informed that sales were too good for it to be let go (Harcourt, Brace to Cerf, 23 June 1954). William Collins and Sons contacted the ML about sharing the cost of translating the great Russian novelists for the ML and their Pocket Classics (William Collins to Klopfer, 9 July 1954), but nothing appears to have come of this. E. B. White wrote of a ML offer, “About the Bennett Cerf inquiry, I have no interest at the moment in collecting my ‘early work.’ Most of it is in collected form already, a lot of the rest of it isn’t worth collecting, and I’m not in a collecting mood, nor do I want a Modern Library man to start picking around in my spotty past” (E. B. White to Cass Canfield, 4 October 1954; *Letters of E. B. White*, p. 399). \n\nCerf received a suggestion to reprint his humor books as an ML Giant.

Parkway Printing had been acquired by Wolff Bindery—which allowed the Modern Library to contract with one company for all of its printing and binding. Eight new titles were added and four were discontinued. An additional title was superseded. The Modern Library had 302 titles available in 1955.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1956 1956 The discussions with Allen Lane that began in 1954 about the possibility of Random House acquiring the American branch of Penguin Books resumed in the summer of 1956. A Random House memorandum in July outlined a possible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American market. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in America, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin obligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library Paperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August, Cerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on the situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own paper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands” (Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at this point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer wrote Lane: \n\n> Almost a year has gone by since our negotiations blew up. This is just a line to tell you that Bennett and I are just as interested as we were a year ago. If you had a change of heart or mind, I’ll be delighted to fly over and talk with you—or maybe you could use it as an excuse to come over here. We would like to see you! (Klofper to Lane, 28 August 1958). \n\nBut the Random House-Penguin negotiations were over. Random House expanded by acquiring Alfred A. Knopf in 1960. Penguin merged with Viking Press in 1975 to form Viking Penguin. \n\nThe Modern Library continued to lose popular titles as original publishers started their own quality paperback imprints. In February 1956, for example, Doubleday informed Cerf they wished to terminate the Modern Library’s contract for Conrad’s *Victory* and put it into an Anchor edition. Doubleday eventually relented, perhaps because *Victory* was only five years away from entering the public domain. But other significant titles were lost to such arrangements. For example, Viking Press withdrew James Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* in 1956 and later, reprint agreements for other titles were withdrawn. Ten new titles were added to the series. Seven titles were discontinued. Tchekov, *Plays* (1930) was superseded by Chekhov *Best Plays* and Voltaire’s *Candide* (1918) was superseded by Voltaire’s *Candide and Other Writings.* This brought the total in the title list to 305. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray. The binding cloth was red, blue, green, or gray with lettering on inset panels in black on the front cover and spine. \\$1.45.

Cerf asked Richard Watts, Jr., to edit *New Voices in the European Theatre* as a companion volume to the 1955 anthology, *New Voices in the American Theatre* (Cerf to Watts, 11 October 1956). Watts was interested but the book never appeared. John W. Aldridge suggested ten possible ML titles, including a Wodehouse reader, Ford Madox Ford’s *The Good Soldier*, Malcolm Lowry’s *Under the Volcano*, a volume of Nathanael West’s novels, the basic writings of Alfred North Whitehead, a Sherlock Holmes collection in the Giants, a Giant anthology of great short novels, and an anthology of fiction by younger postwar writers (Aldridge to Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Stein liked the Wodehouse and great short novels ideas and noted that Macmillan had turned down earlier proposals for a Whitehead collection (Stein memo to Haydn, undated). Cerf thought the Wodehouse and Whitehead collections and the great short novels and postwar fiction anthologies had possibilities (Cerf to Aldridge, 22 August 1956). Aldridge submitted a tentative table of contents for *Great American Short Novels*, but the only ML title that resulted from his proposals was Wodehouse’s *Selected Stories* (1958: 505).

A Random House memorandum in July outlined a possible basis for the purchase of Penguin Books for the American market. This included agreements to maintain the Penguin imprint in America, an equitable plan for taking over all existing Penguin obligations, and the possible abandonment of the Modern Library Paperback series (Random House memorandum, 12 July 1956). In August, Cerf told Lane: “We are very serious about pursuing exploratory talks on the situation and, in fact, will hold up all decisions on our own paper-back plans until we know just where this whole matter stands” (Cerf to Lane, 20 August 1956). But Lane was not willing to negotiate at this point. However, Random House remained interested. In 1958, Klopfer wrote Lane: [object Object]",

Publishers at this period, however, feared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off raising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no alternative. The \\$1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954. It increased to \\$1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1 January 1957, the price rose again, this time to \\$1.65. \n\nAs long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the Modern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents per copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the retail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers to whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties were going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no general policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to be paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only when pressure from individual authors and publishers left no alternative. \n\nIn 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in royalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of Little, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions. \n\nRandom House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause concerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the Modern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed figure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s own authors in the event of price increases. \n\nSales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing steadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark for the first time in 1957.

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1958 1958 In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the Modern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason Epstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at Doubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books pioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other publishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a brilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the publishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who also admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and difficult to work with. \n\nPart of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an independent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library, which Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make his fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after several years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for Modern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern Library itself. \n\nDespite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of the series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another person, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have saved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have accelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital up-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been abandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or because to do the job right would have been too expensive for the potential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of contemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s image as a series of indisputably significant books. \n\nEpstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a change from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the Modern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had always been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial success had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series might have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at a minimum. Nine titles were added and six were discontinued. Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (1931) was superseded by Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings.* This brought the list of available titles to 312. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray.

Moses Hadas suggested a ML reprint of the edition of ten plays of Euripides that he and John Harvey McLean had translated (Dial Press, 1936), but Penguin Books and New American Library had both recently published inexpensive new translations and Jason Epstein thought the ML should wait (Epstein to Hadas, 14 November 1958). In the end the ML reprinted the University of Chicago Press’s *Complete Greek Tragedie*s, edited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore (4 vols., 1959; ML reprint, 7 volumes, 1960–63). Eric Bentley suggested a book of six Lope de Vega plays (Bentley to Epstein, 16 November 1958).

          "v": " MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1959 1959 During the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had been immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a steady upward climb. As the 1950s ended, the publishing industry was on the verge of a period of tremendous growth and change. By 1959, publishers whose stock was traded on Wall Street included American Book Company, Bobbs-Merrill, Book-of-the-Month Club, Holt, Houghton Mifflin, Macmillan, McGraw-Hill, Prentice-Hall, Rand McNally, and World (PW, 12 October 1959, p. 27). \n\nOn 2 October 1959, Random House became a public corporation: 222,060 shares of Random House stock were placed on sale at \\$11.25 a share. Cerf and Klopfer remained firmly in control of the firm; the stock sold to the public represented only 30 percent of Random House’s total stock. As a result of the sale, Cerf and Klopfer each received a check for more than a million dollars. \n\nMaking Random House a public organization changed the nature of the business. Cerf has written: \n\n> Suddenly Random House embarked on its financial career and expansion. This marked a big change, since the minute you go public, outsiders own some of your stock and you’ve got to make periodic reports to them. You owe your investors dividends and profits. Instead of working for yourself and doing what you damn please, willing to risk a loss on something you want to do, if you’re any kind of honest man, you feel a real responsibility to your stockholders. It was a very important decision (Cerf, *At Random*, pp. 277–78). \n\nThe following year, Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and its outstanding quality paperback line, Vintage Books. But while Random House and publishing in general were thriving, the 1950s marked the end of the growth of the Modern Library. By the mid-1960s, interest in the Modern Library on the part of the public was low and the series was in serious trouble. Ten titles were added and two were discontinued, bringing the total to 320. All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray. The binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset panels in black on the front cover and spine. \\$1.65 (Spring) Auden, *Selected Poetry* xSalinger, *Nine Stories*; Giants through G82 with G38 Rolland, *Jean-Christophe* (=fall 1959/spring 1960); jackets: 385. (Fall) Salinger, *Nine Stories* xColette, *Six Novels*; Giants through G82 with G38 Rolland, *Jean-Christophe* (=spring 1959/spring 1960); jackets: 388 (=spring 1960). Jason Epstein, who moved from Alfred A. Knopf to Random House around this time, had many ideas for the ML. He expressed interest in Samuel Johnson’s *Lives of the Poets*. He asked William Barnett and Morton White to edit a book on modern philosophy for ML Giants, indicating that it could sell 15,000–20,000 copies a year (Epstein to White, 24 February 1959). Mark Van Doren, who had edited *The Poetry of John Dryden* (Harcourt, Brace & Howe, 1920) nearly forty years earlier, declined an invitation to edit a collection of Dryden’s works for the ML (Van Doren to Epstein, 20 May 1959). Epstein asked William Arrowsmith, whose translation of Petronius, *Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press, 1959) had recently appeared, to translate *Aristophanes* for the ML, indicating that he thought it would earn annual royalties between \\$500 and \\$1,000 (Epstein to Arrowsmith, 23 October 1959). He invited F. W. Dupee to translate a selection of the works of the Marquis de Sade for the ML; as a second choice he expressed interest in a translation of Flaubert’s *Sentimental Education* (Epstein to Dupee, 17 November 1959). \n\nCerf wanted to include the one-volume edition of James George Frazer’s *The Golden Bough* (Macmillan, 1922) in ML Giants and asked C. Edgar Phreaner Jr. to seek rights (Phreaner to Cerf, 27 July 1959). He offered Little, Brown an advance of \\$6,000 for Edith Hamilton, *Mythology*, originally published in 1942 (Cerf to Arthur Thornhill, 26 October 1959), and he asked Professor William Alfred of Harvard University about translations for a volume of Middle English literature for the ML, saying “It would be a good idea, I think, for the Modern Library to include an Anthology of this type” (Cerf to Alfred, 17 November 1959). None of these works were added to the ML. \n\nSeveral of Epstein’s suggestions resulted in additions to the series: *A Kierkegaard Anthology* (1959: 518), Dickens, *Our Mutual Friend* (1960: 524), and the Bernard Guilbert Guerney translation of Turgenev, *Fathers and Sons* (1917: 20.2a), which replaced the Constance Garnett translation in the ML in 1961 (Epstein to Klopfer, 12 January 1959). Other titles suggested by Epstein included Goodspeed’s translation of *The Apocrypha* (1962: 541), *The Space Handbook* (ML Paperbacks, November 1959), and Bernard Malamud’s *The Magic Barrel* (ML Paperbacks, April 1960). \n\nEpstein offered a \\$500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for reprint rights to the William Arrowsmith translation of Petronius, *Satyricon* (University of Michigan Press, 1959) but withdrew the offer when he discovered that a paperback edition would be published by Mentor Books (Epstein to Fred D. Wieck, 30 November 1959). *An Anthology of Russian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak*, edited by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, was considered for the ML but was published in 1960 as a Random House trade book. Other titles considered included E. M. W. Tillyard, *The Elizabethan World Picture*; Jacob Bronowski, *The Common Sense of Science*; and *Five Plays* of Eugene O’Neill. *A Documentary History of Communism*, edited by Robert V. Daniels, was considered for the ML but was postponed (Minutes of ML Meeting, 5 February 1959); it ended up being published in two volumes in Vintage Books. \n\nEpstein wanted to strengthen the ML’s offerings of poetry. He suggested volumes devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer, the Cavalier Poets (Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, and Richard Lovelace) and collections of the poetry of Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Samuel Johnson, Christopher Smart, W. S. Landor, Robert Burns, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also suggested publishing several longer poems as separate ML volumes, including Wordsworth’s *The Prelude*, Browning’s *The Ring and the Book*, Edmund Spenser’s *The Faerie Queen*, and the narrative poems of William Butler Yeats (Epstein to Andrew Chiappe, 6 February 1959). None of these proposals came to fruition. \n\nCharles Singleton, professor of humanities studies at Johns Hopkins University, signed a contract to prepare a new translation of Dante’s *Divine Comedy* for the ML, for which he received a \\$3,000 advance against royalties of 6½ percent of the retail price. In the end the project took longer than expected and expanded beyond the single volume that the ML anticipated. Singleton’s edition was published in six volumes by Princeton University Press between 1970 and 1975. Each of the three parts—*Inferno*, *Purgatorio*, and *Paradiso—*consisted of a volume containing the Italian text and Singleton’s translation and a volume of commentary by Singleton. \n\nEpstein was also looking for new translations of several works that were already in the ML. The Ennis Rees translations of Homer’s *Iliad* (1929: 186.2) and *Odyssey* (1929: 187.2), published by Random House in 1960 and 1963, replaced the 19th-century translations of Lang, Leaf and Myers and Butcher and Lang in the ML between 1962 and 1964. The Samuel Putnam translation of Cervantes, *Don Quixote*, published by Viking Press in two volumes in 1949, replaced the Ozell revision of the Motteux translation in 1964 in the regular ML and ML Giants. \n\nOther works that Epstein wanted to include in the ML were *Hindu, Buddhist, and Confucian Traditions* by Theodore de Bary, *Japanese Plays* by Donald Keene, and the forthcoming edition of Pushkin’s *Eugene Onegin,* translated with commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (Bollingen Foundation, 1964). Also being sought were new translations of Homer’s *Odyssey* and *Iliad* and the University of Chicago’s translations of Greek Drama (Epstein to Cerf, 3 September 1959). The ML reprinted the Chicago edition of *The Complete Greek Tragedies* in seven volumes between 1960 and 1963. \n\nAndrew Chiappe suggested Livy’s *Hannibal’s Campaign*, Tolstoy’s *Essays*, Balzac’s *Lost Illusions*, and Terence’s *Comedies* (Chiappe, November 1959). Epstein intended to add Sir Philip Sidney’s *Arcadia*, for which he paid William G. Miller \\$500 for editing work (Epstein to Miller 9 November 1959). Of these only Tolstoy, *Selected Essays* (1964: 564) and Balzac, *Lost Illusions* (1967: G109) appeared in the ML. \n\nKlopfer asked Macmillan for reprint rights to Margaret Mitchell’s *Gone with the Wind* for ML Giants. Macmillan considered the offer seriously but Bruce Brett, the president of the firm, concluded that “this is not the time for it” (Brett to Klopfer, 15 December 1959). \n\nJohn Clive, whose *Macaulay: The Shaping of a Historian* would be published by Knopf in 1973, suggested a ML selection of Macaulay’s works. Epstein declined the proposal, noting that ML titles had to sell “a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 copies a year for a considerable period, which means that it has to be assigned to undergraduates in fairly substantial numbers” (Epstein to Clive, 15 September 1959). *Modern Library Dictionary* (1959–1970) 509 \nAuden, *Selected Poetry* (1959–1971) 510 \nRodgers and Hammerstein, *Six Plays* (1959– ) 511 \nWeidman, *I Can Get It for You Wholesale* (1959–1971) 512 \nJung, *Basic Writings* (1959– ) 513 \nBierstedt, ed., *Making of Society* (1959–1974) 514 \nVasari, *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects* (1959–1970) 515 \nSalinger, *Nine Stories* (1959–1964) 516 \nHoward, *World’s Great Operas* (1959–1970) 517 \nKierkegaard, *Kierkegaard Anthology* (1959– ) 518 Hoffenstein, *Complete Poetry of Samuel Hoffenstein* (1954) \nMcCord, ed., *What Cheer* (1955) \n\n#### ***Spring*** During the early 1950s Modern Library sales were lower than they had been immediately after the war, but by the mid-1950s they had begun a steady upward climb.
